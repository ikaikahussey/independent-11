"caption":"Diamond Head is Oahu's largest tuff cone formed over 100,000 years ago by an active bubbling volcano. Nineteenth century British sailors nicknamed the crater Diamond Head when they mistook the calcite crystals for diamonds. A well-graded trail leads you up the 760-feet summit to a World War II bunker with a bird's eye view of Honolulu.",

<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;The State will close the Diamond Head trail throughout the months of January and early February to make needed improvements and repairs.&nbsp; The trail will be closed January 10 to 13, 18 to 20, 24 to 28, and January  31 to February 4; no bypass to the trail is available.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Sections of the summit trail have deteriorated due to the effects of erosion and heavy use. Contractor Prometheus Construction has completed the major repairs to the trail surface and sides, but the anchoring of areas along the trail with rockfall potential have yet to be completed. </p>

<p>There will be no impact to the crater access road, however, so the park area within the crater will remain open during normal daily park hours.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The project will cost about $1 million and is expected be completed by Saturday, February 5.</p>

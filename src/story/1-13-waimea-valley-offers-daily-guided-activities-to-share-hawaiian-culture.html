<p>WAIMEA&#8212;The North Shore&#8217;s Waimea Valley is one of the last partially intact ahupuaa on Oahu and consists of 1,875 acres that are home to 78 archaeological sites, a 150 acre botanical garden, and several native and endangered birds. The valley has been a sacred place for more than 700 years of Native Hawaiian history.</p>

<p>Also known as “The Valley of the Priests,” Waimea Valley gained its title around 1090 when the ruler of Oahu awarded the land to the kahuna nui. Descendants of the high priests lived in the valley and cared for much of it until 1886. In 2006 the Office of Hawaiian Affairs acquired the lush valley as part of a cooperative conservation land purchase, and in 2008 Hi&#8217;ipaka LLC was established to manage the valley and hold the dead. </p>

<p>Today, Hiipaka LLC is making an effort to share the Hawaiian culture creating classes, activities, tours, and hikes to share with the public. </p>

<p><I>Below is schedule of Waimea Valley&#8217;s daily guided activities for the first quarter of 2011. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.waimeavalley.net/" title="http://www.waimeavalley.net">http://www.waimeavalley.net</a></i></p>

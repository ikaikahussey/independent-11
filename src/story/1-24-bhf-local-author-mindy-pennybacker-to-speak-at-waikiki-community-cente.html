<p>Mindy Pennybacker, author of <i>Do One Green Thing: Saving the Earth through Simple, Everyday Choices</i>, is giving a free presentation on Wednesday, January 26 at 10:30 a.m. at the Waikiki Community Center Chapel, located at 310 Paoakalani Ave. </p>

<p>Pennybacker&#8217;s streamlined guide is ideal for those looking for easy and achievable ideas for ways to go &#8220;green.&#8221; In her handbook for daily life, she discusses a broad range of questions in four sections: food and drink, green and healthy homes, personal care and apparel, and transportation. </p>

<p>A Punahou graduate, Pennybacker is a journalist specializing in personal and environmental health and helping consumers identify truly, verifiably green products. For 11 years, she was editor-in-chief of <i>The Green Guide</i> and co-founder of <a href="TheGreenGuide.com" target="_blank">TheGreenGuide.com</a>. She has also been editor of <i>Honolulu Weekly</i> and a senior editor at <i>Plenty</i> and <i>This Old House</i> magazines. </p>

<p>Pennybacker&#8217;s writing has appeared in diverse publications such as <i>Glamour</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Sierra</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and this newspaper. With this book she has been interviewed on national T.V., including being a guest with Martha Stewart. </p>

<p>&#8220;The key to making green a byword in everyone&#8217;s life is ease of access,&#8221; Meryl Streep wrote in the foreword. &#8220;This focus is what makes <i>Do One Green Thing</i> such a pleasure to read.&#8221;</p>

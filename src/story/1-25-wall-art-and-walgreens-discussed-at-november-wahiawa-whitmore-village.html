<p>OFFICIAL&#8217;S MONTHLY REPORTS:</p>

<p>First Responders and Defenders:</p>

<p>Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) – Captain Anthony Sung reported the following:</p>

<p>October 2010 Statistics – The HFD responded to a total of 90 calls; 3 structure, 8 wildland, 7 rubbish, 2 vehicle, 65 medical, 1 search and rescue, and 4 miscellaneous.</p>

<p>Fire Safety Tips – The holiday season means festive decorations, extensive food preparations, and family get-togethers. Enjoy family celebrations during the holiday season with the following helpful fire wise tips:</p>

<p>Consider a fire-resistant, artificial Christmas tree. If a real tree is purchased, choose one as fresh as possible and keep it hydrated and away from heat sources. Use noncombustible materials for decorations. Choose only Underwriter&#8217;s Laboratory-approved electrical decoration and follow the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions for installation and usage. Do not overload extension cords.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Family gatherings often include extensive food preparation and visiting guests. If you must leave the stove, even for a few minutes, turn it off. Unattended cooking is the number one cause of home fires. Have a metal lid ready to cover grease fires in pans. Never wear long, loose-sleeved clothing while cooking. Turn the handles on pots and pans inward to prevent accidents. Keep children away from cooking areas.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Turkey fryers can be very dangerous. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) discourages the use of outdoor gas-fueled turkey fryers that immerse the poultry in hot oil. The NFPA states that &#8220;turkey fryers that use oil, as currently designed, are not suitable for acceptably safe use even by a well-informed and careful consumer.&#8221; Further information can be found on the NFPA website at www.nfpa.org. Using the search engine, type &#8220;turkey fryers.&#8221;</p>

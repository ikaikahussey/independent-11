<p>Fire Safety Tip: A) Enjoy family celebrations during the holiday season with the following helpful firewise tips: Consider a fire-resistant, artificial Christmas tree. If purchasing a real tree choose one that is fresh, keep it hydrated and away from heat sources. . Use noncombustible materials for decorations. Choose only Underwriter’s laboratory-approved electrical decorations and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation and usage. Do not overload extension cords. B) If you must leave the stove while cooking, even for a few minutes, turn it off. Unattended cooking is the number one cause of home fires. Have a metal lid ready to cover grease fires in pans. Never wear long, loose-sleeved clothing while cooking. Turn the handles on pots and pans inward to prevent accidents. Keep children away from cooking areas. C) Turkey fryers can be very dangerous. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) discourages the use of outdoor gas-fueled turkey fryers that immerse the poultry I hot oil because the fryers are not suitable for acceptably safe use even by a well-informed and careful consumer. Further information can be found on the NFPA website at www.nfpa.org; using the search engine, type in “turkey<br />
fryers.” D) When hosting overnight guests, share the home escape plan with them, including the designated meeting place outside the home.</p>

<p>RESOLUTION REQUESTING THAT FURTHER CITY &amp; COUNTY OF HONOLULU DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS IN LEEWARD AND CENTRAL OAHU BE DEFERRED PENDING COMPLETION OF THE OVERDUE REVISIONS OF THE EWA DEVELOPMENT AND CENTRAL OAHU SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PLANS:</p>

<p>WHEREAS, Central Oahu residents are concerned about both the necessity for and the number of developments proposed in Ewa and the adequacy of the regional infrastructure, both existing and proposed, to support such development if approved; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, adding another 46,000 housing units in the Ewa plains as proposed in the Ewa Development Plan will severely impact all Leeward and Central Oahu residents who commute on H-1 and H-2, west and north of the H-1/H-2 merge; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, adding another 20,000 housing units in Central Oahu, as proposed in the Central Oahu Sustainable Communities Plan, will severely impact Central Oahu commuter travel times to and from<br />
Downtown and Kapolei as well as add to and further exacerbate Leeward commuter travel times to and from downtown Honolulu; and </p>

<p>WHEREAS, the City and County of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting develops long range plans for Oahu&#8217;s eight planning areas, under the overall guidance of the Oahu General Plan.</p>

<p>WHEREAS, the long range plan for Central Oahu, the Central Oahu Sustainable Communities Plan (COSC), was adopted by the City Council in late 2002, while the Ewa Development Plan was adopted in 1997.&nbsp; Although each ordinance adopting the plans required an evaluation of the plans every five years, no 5-Year Review has been undertaken or completed for either the Ewa or COSC Plans since their initial adoption by the City Council in 1997 and 2002 respectively; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, the 5-Year Reviews should examine whether changes are needed to the plans and how implementation of the plans’ vision and policies might be improved.&nbsp; Areas of analysis should include the irretrievable loss of remaining prime agricultural A &amp; B lands in Leeward/Central Oahu; the availability of agricultural land with a view to self-sufficiency; whether the developments proposed for each region are needed; whether the projected commuter travel times of two hours each way to and from downtown Honolulu are acceptable to governmental decision-makers and Leeward /Central residents; the ability of existing and proposed transportation improvements for the region, including rail transit, to adequately accommodate all of the development allowed or proposed; how best to determine and apply service and facility design standards or level of service, also known as “concurrency,” guidelines for determining infrastructure adequacy in Leeward/Central Oahu; now therefore,</p>

<p>BE IT RESOLVED that Neighborhood Board No. 25 requests that further City &amp; County of Honolulu development approvals in Leeward and Central Oahu be deferred pending completion and adoption by ordinance of the overdue revisions of the Ewa Development and Central Oahu Sustainable Communities plans; and<br />
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Mayor of the City &amp; County of Honolulu, all members of the Honolulu City Council, the Director of the City &amp; County of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting, the Director of the City &amp; County of Honolulu Department of Transportation Services; the City Planning Commission, the State Office of Planning, the State Land Use Commission, Leeward and Central Oahu area legislators, and all members of Leeward and Central Oahu Neighborhood Boards.</p>

<p>Adopted by Mililani-Waipio-Melemanu Neighborhood Board No. 25 at its regular meeting of October 27, 2010, by a vote of 19-0-0.</p>

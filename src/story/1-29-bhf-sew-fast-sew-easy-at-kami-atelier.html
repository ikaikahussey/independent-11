<p>&#8220;Old fashioned&#8221; domestic skills that foster self-reliance such as gardening, canning, and sewing are making a comeback. If you have always wanted to learn to sew, here is an opportunity to finally give that sewing machine you inherited a workout. </p>

<p>Local designer Kami Lizares is offering a month of weekly lessons in the basics of cutting patterns, (safely) using a sewing machine, and understanding simple tools and terminology&#8212;all for half the price of a new pair of designer jeans. By the end of your first class, youâ€™ll have created a throw pillow. As your skills advance, Lizares and her team will help you design and sew fresh, inspired updates to your wardrobe or home.</p>

<p><i>Classes are held at Kami Atelier, inside Studio Modiste, second floor, Manoa Marketplace. Saturdays from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Tuesdays from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. $120 for four classes. Drop-in classes are $35 each. Reservations required. Call (808) 429-6521 for more information. </i></p>

<p>Honolulu Fire Department – Capt. John Bredin reported;</p>

<p>October 2010 Statistics: Included 1 vehicle fire, 61 medical emergencies, 7 search/rescues and 13 miscellaneous calls.</p>

<p>Safety Tip – For many people, the holiday season means festive decorations, extensive food preparations and family get togethers. Enjoy family celebrations during the holiday season with the following helpful fire wise tips:</p>

<p>Consider a fire resistant, artificial Christmas tree. If a real tree is purchased, choose one as fresh as possible and keep it hydrated and away from heat sources. Use non-combustible materials for decorations. Choose only underwriter’s laboratory approved electrical decorations and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installation and usage. Do not over load extension cords.<br />
Family gatherings often include extensive food preparation and visiting guests. If you must leave the stove, even for a few minutes, turn it off. Unattended cooking is the number one cause of home fires. Have a metal lid ready to cover grease fires in pans. Never wear long, loose sleeved clothing while cooking. Turn the handles on pots and pans inward to prevent accidents. Keep children away from cooking areas.<br />
Turkey fryers can be very dangerous. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) discourages the use of outdoor gas fueled turkey fryers that immerse the poultry in hot oil. The NFPA states that turkey fryers that use oil, as currently designed, are not suitable for acceptably safe use even by a well informed and careful consumer. Further information can be found on the NFPA website at www.nfpa.org. Using the search engine, type in “turkey fryers”.<br />
If you are hosting overnight guests, share your home escape plan with them, including the designated meeting place outside the home.</p>

<p>Honolulu Police Departmet – Lt. G. Lum Kee reported;</p>

<p>Mayor Carlisle’s Representative – Jim Fulton reported;</p>

<p>City Lands: The process of selling City lands is described in Chapter 37, Revised Ordinance of Honolulu, 1990, as amended. Any City agency having under its jurisdiction and control real property which is no longer desired or needed by the agency submits a list of such real property to the Budget and Fiscal Services Director (“BFS Director”).&nbsp; The BFS Director prepares an inventory of such real property and circulates this list to the agencies of the City. If any other City agency indicates a need for the use of any listed real property, the BFS Director may recommend to the Mayor the transfer of the use of the real property to that City agency. If the real property is not recommended for transfer to another City agency, or is not transferred within a reasonable time, the property is then deemed surplus real property. The BFS Director, with the concurrence of the Corporation Counsel, shall determine whether to recommend to the City Council the disposal of the surplus real property. The BFS Director submits a recommendation and draft resolution to the City Council before any surplus real property may be disposed of. The City Council determines whether to adopt the resolution authorizing the BFS Director to dispose of the surplus property in accordance with that resolution or by ordinance.</p>

These fun and educational workshops, which are held at the Board of Water Supply’s Halawa Xeriscape Garden, focus on the concept of xeriscaping – an innovative means of conserving water through efficient landscaping and other means of saving water outdoors. BWS estimates that about half of the water consumed by the average single family is used outdoors. Incorporating xeriscaping techniques at home has shown to reduce water consumption anywhere between 30 and 80 percent, which also results in lower water bills. The Xeriscape Holiday Wreath workshop will be coming up on November 27, 2010. The ever-popular rain barrel catchment workshops are coming up in February and May 2011, in addition to classes on composting, organic pest control, and much more. Copies of the schedule for the board members and the public are on the table. Visit the BWS website www.boardofwatersupply.com to check out the exciting list of classes being offered at the Halawa Xersicape Garden. Again, all of the workshops offered help to educate the community about water conservation outdoors.</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Pond Access: It was asked if more people would be allowed to visit the fishpond. It was noted that the KS program would eventually evolve to accommodate more visitors.</p>

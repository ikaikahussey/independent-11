<p>Kahuku – Included 3 rubbish and 1 vehicle fire; emergency responses included 9 medical, 1 search/rescue, and 1 miscellaneous call.</p>

<p>Fire Safety Tip – A) Consider a fire-resistant artificial Christmas tree. If purchasing a real tree, choose one as fresh as possible, keep it hydrated, and away from heat sources. Use non-combustible materials for decorations and do not overload extension cords. B) When cooking if you must leave the stove even for a few minutes, turn it off. Unattended cooking is the number one cause of home fires. Keep children away from cooking areas.

<p>6:25 p.m. Fale arrived; 7 members present.&nbsp; Vice Chair Steward relinquished the gavel to Chair Fale.</p>

<p>Mayor Peter Carlisle’s Representative – Bryan Mick reported the following:</p>

<p>Hau`ula Beach Park Group Campsite Conversion – The group site was not converted to individual camp sites; individual camp sites existed along with the group site. When Ko`kololio Beach Park was purchased and developed, the plan was to move the group site to this beach park. Due to the demand for group camping, both sites were kept open. The closure of the group site at Hau`ula Beach Park was due to erosion of the old pavilion area, lack of parking and the reduction of open space for campers. Parties were notified in March 2010 that the last group camping reservation would be for the Labor Day weekend in September 2010.</p>

<p>Could the Public Advisory Committee (PAC) be Elected rather than Appointed – The Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP) utilizes project advisory committees to assist and provide the department and its consultant with a community-based perspective for its planning projects. DPP strives to create a balanced committee, and members are usually identified based on their reputation, previous community work, and willingness to provide input and ideas for the course of the update process. There is no process in place for the public to elect project advisory committee members.</p>

<p>Appropriate Setbacks for Wind Farms – The Land Use Ordinance (LUO) Sections 21 – 4.60(c) (7) and 21.5.700 (a) impose a minimum setback from all property lines equal to the fully extended vertical height of the proposed wind machine(s). Requests to allow a wind farm generally require a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) as a utility installation, Type B, power generation). Adequate setbacks from nearby and surrounding uses are evaluated as part of the CUP process. Currently there are no locally established, adopted, or even commonly recognized minimum setback requirements for wind farms from other uses. However, potential impacts due to noise, light flicker, and other relevant issues will be thoroughly evaluated, based on the specific proposal, site characteristics, character of the surrounding neighborhood, etc., as part of the analysis of the CUP request for a proposed wind farm. This is reviewed in advance of a CUP application as part of an Environmental Assessment (EA).</p>

<p>Ko`olauloa Sustainable Plan Draft Revisions – While respectful of the PAC perspective and recommendations, DPP is responsible for submitting its recommendations to the Planning Commission and City Council, based on all considerations, not just PAC input. Envision Laie’s proposal is included in the Public Review Draft (distributed last month). In response to the strong community support received, the draft responds to the overwhelming concern for more affordable housing in the region.</p>

<p>Power of the Transit Authority and Funding Mechanisms to have Access – The Public Transit Authority shall have the power to acquire property on behalf of the City by purchase, lease, eminent domain or otherwise for construction, maintenance, repair, operation or expansion of the fixed guide-way system, provided that therefore initiating such acquisitions, the Authority will notify the City Council in writing, with a list of the parcels to be acquired. The board will set rates and changes for the fixed guide-way system so that those revenues, in conjunction with the revenues from the generating properties of the authority, will support the fixed guide-way system and the authority itself.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns:</p>

<p>Hau`ula Beach Park – A) Board member Kelly-Paddock reported that the community met with THE Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) Director Les Chang and was assured that camping would continue.

<p>Ko’olauloa Sustainable Communities Plan Update- Barbara Kahana reminded everyone that there would be a meeting Dec. 7 at Kahuku. This meeting starts at 6:30 PM but come early to get seating in the café.<br />
It is critical for the future of Koolauloa that everyone participate. This meeting is an open public comment session held by Dept. of Planning and Permitting for community members in Ko`olauloa to comment on the DRAFT of the Ko`olauloa Sustainable Communities Plan. Anyone can testify. There will probably be a 3 minute limit for each person’s comments. You can also comment in writing and bring this to the meeting Dec. 7 or you can comment online at www.honoluludpp.org. Barbara suggested that even if you are unsure whether or not the “Envision Laie” project is necessary, we should all ask the hard questions about how “Envision Laie” would be paid for including all the infrastructure changes needed to accommodate it such as too much traffic on Kam Highway! If Kam Highway is widened (as Department of Planning &amp; Permitting Director, Tanoue suggested) how would that impact all the communities along that route??? There are also many concerns about traffic, sewage, run-off and where the water will come from to support this new town? How is this all going to be funded? There are concerns about “what is affordable housing?” can people really afford what will be proposed…will it be $300,000-$400,000 1000-1200 sq ft. units without yards or other typical single family home amenities? That the affordable housing proposed is only for members of the LDS Church…how is that legal!? So please come and ask your questions Dec.7. This may be your only opportunity…don’t wait till the bulldozers start taking the country out of the country! </p>

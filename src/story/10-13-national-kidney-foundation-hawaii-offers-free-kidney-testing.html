<p>On Saturday, October 16, the National Kidney Foundation of Hawaii (NKFH) is offering free testing for diabetes (glucose/ A1c), cholesterol, bone disease (cal/phos/PTH), and kidney disease (eGFR). Urine tests for protein (microalbumin/ A:C ratio) and physical measurements for heart disease including BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure will also be taken.</p>

<p>To qualify, participants must have diabetes, high blood pressure, family history of heart disease, diabetes, or kidney disease and must be at least 18 years old. Potential recipients of the testing cannot be on dialysis or have received kidney transplant. Medical professionals will be available to discuss test results while blood test results will be mailed to out in four to six weeks.</p>

<p>NKFH says the testing generally takes about one hour and people wishing to attend are advised to pre-register to guarantee a space. The NKFH is asking for people to come well hydrated and say that eight hours of fasting previous to testing is recommended but not required. Prescription medication is okay. </p>

<p>According to a recent article in the <i>North Shore News</i>, Hawaii&#8217;s population continues to be one of the highest in the nation that is at risk of developing kidney disease. Early detection is important for kidney disease, with the disease turning to chronic kidney disease (CKD) without treatment. Once CKD is reached, the final treatment is dialysis. The National Kidney Foundation of Hawaii says that kidneys two of the most important organs. Kidneys help remove waste and excess fluid, filter the blood while keeping some compounds and removing others, and help regulate blood pressure. A 2004 report by the Center for Disease control reported that an estimated 80,000 persons have chronic kidney failure diagnosed annually. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, State Rep. Maile Shimabukuro joined the University of Hawaii at Manoa&#8217;s Educational Talent Search (METS) program to help clean up beaches along the Waianae Coast. With almost 100 volunteers from Waianae and Nanakuli High School, they sprawled Maili Beach and Lualualei Beach, also known as “Sewers,” picking up any rubbish in sight. </p>

<p>“The purpose of this clean-up is to give the students a sense of responsibility for their community while learning about their kuleana,” said Tanya Uyehara, METS Student Advisor, in a statement.</p>

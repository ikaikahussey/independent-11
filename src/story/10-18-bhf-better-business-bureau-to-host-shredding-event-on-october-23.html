<p>MOILIILI&#8212;To help protect businesses and consumers against identity theft, Hawaii’s Better Business Bureau (BBB) will partner with Access Information Management to host &#8220;Secure Your ID Day&#8221; events across East Oahu on October 23.</p>

<p>Everyone is invited to bring up to three boxes or bags of documents, CDs, and floppy disks containing personal information for free on-the-spot shredding. Documents should be removed from binders, but staples and paper clips can be shredded.</p>

<p>This year, BBB will also be accepting cell phones for recycling. Consumers can drop off their old cell phones in secure recycling boxes courtesy of The Wireless Alliance. </p>

<p>BBB staff and Bank of Hawaii volunteers will be on hand with information on how businesses and consumers can protect themselves from identity theft.</p>

<p>BBB Secure Your ID Day is part of the National Foundation of Credit Counseling’s National Protect Your Identity Week.</p>

<p>The event happens Saturday, October 23 from 10:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. at both McKinley High School (1039 S. King St.) and Aina Haina School (801 W. Hind Drive).</p>

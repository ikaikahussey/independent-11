<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Last week, the Honolulu Academy of Arts was transformed into the Silk Road, the theme of this September&#8217;s ARTafterDARK party. Its courtyards were transformed into the different regions&#8212;from China to India&#8212;of the infamous route. DJ Nocturna got the crowd shaking their bellies in the Central Courtyard while Town restaurant served up tasty Middle Eastern inspired eats. Dancing under the stars continues to be a real treat for revelers, as is the people-watching. </p>

<p>ARTafterDARK is the Honolulu Academy of Arts&#8217; monthly art party organized by a dynamic group of young volunteers dedicated to exploring the arts. Next month&#8217;s party, &#8220;Seven Deadly Sins,&#8221; is the last of this popular series for the year and will be October 29, from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Waimea Valley is a living puuhonua, a place of peace and safety, for Hawaii and the world and one of Oahu’s last partially intact aahupua, according to the Waimea Valley website. The 1,875 acre valley is considered significant in the history of Hawaii and a repository for Hawaiian spirituality and traditions. Waimea, “The Valley of the Priests,” gained its title around 1090 when the ruler of Oahu awarded the land to the kahuna nui. Descendants of the high priests lived and cared for much of the Valley until 1886.</p>

<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;There are two candidates in the State Senate District 9 race going into the General Election on November 2.</p>

<p>District 9 comprises Palolo, St. Louis Heights, Maunalani Heights, Kaimuki, Kapahulu, West Diamond Head, and Waikiki Gold Coast.</p>

<p><i>The Hawaii Independent</i> presented reader-submitted questions to each General Election candidate. Responses will be published in the order in which they are received. </p>

<p>Senate District 9 incumbent <b>Les Ihara</b> has been serving on the State Senate since 1994. From 1995 to 1996, he was the Democratic Senate Majority Floor Leader and from 1997 to 2000 he was Senate Majority Leader. He is currently Majority Policy Leader. </p>

<p>Here are his responses.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
My largest campaign contributor is the Hawaii Association of Realtors, which donated $2,000 in August. In 1994, my campaign decided to voluntarily limit campaign contributions to $250; but it lifted the limit in 2006 until a campaign debt is retired, which has not yet happened.</p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for House Bill 444?</b><br />
I voted for House Bill 444 and will continue to support civil unions in the Senate if re-elected.</p>

<p><b>How, as an elected official, will you support and enforce the existing State laws that protect and nurture the rights of Native Hawaiians?</b><br />
I will vote for such legislation, including appropriations to fund past due payments for &#8220;ceded land&#8221; revenues.</p>

<p><b>What kind of tax relief do you support and how else do we lower the cost of living for full time residents?</b><br />
I support tax relief legislation for lower income residents, including increasing tax credits to offset general excise taxes they pay and establishing a tax credit for family caregiver services.</p>

<p><b>How do you limit bureaucracy in government and manage civil work for efficiency?</b><br />
I support legislation to fund inspector general teams under the supervision of the State Auditor, who should also be authorized to investigate fiscal mismanagement and inefficiencies.</p>

<p><b>What ideas do you have for improving our education system?</b><br />
I support the “Race to the Top” educational reform initiative, including its goals for improving educational outcomes.</p>

<p><b>What’s going to be your input in addressing Hawaii’s &#8220;homeless&#8221; crisis?</b><br />
I support the City and County of Honolulu charter amendment to establish a housing department and would support legislation to encourage coordination among county and State &#8220;homeless&#8221; agencies.</p>

<p><b>How would you improve accountability in government?</b><br />
I would seek implementation of <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0477.htm" title="Act 272 (2007)">Act 272 (2007)</a>, which the current administration has refused to implement, that requires all state contracts for at least $25,000 to be posted on the Internet. I introduced similar legislation that year that was incorporated into the Act.</p>

<p><b>What is your opinion on Hawaii’s current approach to renewable energy?</b><br />
The current approach lacks a program to provide upfront financing and loans to residents who want to install clean energy systems in their homes. In such a program, residents would repay the loans from energy savings over a 10 or 20 year period.</p>

<p><b>Do you support legislation that would establish clear definitions and penalties for human trafficking in Hawaii?</b><br />
Yes.</p>

<p><b>Are you aware of concerns Hawaii residents have with the lack of enforcement of child support laws, and do you see a way you could address it if elected?</b><br />
I know several people who have to pay for childrearing expenses on their own because the father has not paid for child support as required by law and court orders. I believe this is unfair, and deadbeat dads should be required by law to pay their fair share of child support. Additional staff may be needed, and legislative committees may need to investigate this matter.</p>

<p><b>In balancing the State budget, what specific government programs or services would you cut?</b><br />
I am not an advocate for cutting the State budget, and do not propose cutting any specific programs. I do believe, however, that any waste of State funds should be eliminated.</p>

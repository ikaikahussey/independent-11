<p>The North Shore Neighborhood Board&#8217;s commitee on addressing &#8220;homelessness&#8221; on the North Shore will hold a meeting on November 4 at 7:00 p.m. The meeting will be held at the Waialua Community Association in cottage 2, across from the Haleiwa Post Office. On the agenda is information from HMSI Databank, updates on State and City lands, and funding for transitional housing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Homelessness&#8221;&#8212;also referred to as houselessness in order to recognize that those without a personal property to live in are still active participants in our communities and call Hawaii as a whole home&#8212;is a growing issue for residents on Oahu&#8217;s North Shore. Alii Beach Park has been home to many houseless people living both in tents and vehicles along the street, beach, and parking lot. Community members have noted problems such as noise, illegal parking, and camping, as well as drug use and sexual acts in public. However, the beach park and other areas on the North Shore are still serving as temporary homes for the houseless.</p>

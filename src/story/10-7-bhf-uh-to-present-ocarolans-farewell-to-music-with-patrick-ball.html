MANOA&#8212;Patrick Ball is one of the premiere Celtic harpers in the world today and one of the very few to perform exclusively on the rare brass-strung harp. He has recorded nine award-winning instrumental and three spoken word albums, which have sold well over one-half million copies internationally. On Saturday, October 23, the University of Hawaii presents Ball in his one-person musical theatre piece, <i>O&#8217;Carolan&#8217;s Farewell to Music</i>. A beguiling blend of music and spoken word, the performance brings to the stage the legendary life, the turbulent times, and the glorious music of Ireland&#8217;s most celebrated musician: Turlough O&#8217;Carolan. </p>

<p>Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries was a troubled, tumultuous place. The old Gaelic order had been shattered by the English, and the poets, bards, and harp players were set walking the roads. Yet, this dark period of Irish history produced a Celtic harper and composer of such brilliance, grace, and character that O&#8217;Carolan is, to this day, regarded as his country&#8217;s greatest and most beloved musician.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Born in 1670, O&#8217;Carolan was stricken with smallpox at the age of 18 and left totally blind. Through the intercession of a wealthy family he was given three years of instruction on the harp and subsequently began his life as an itinerant musician. For 40 years, he traveled throughout Ireland, staying in the houses of the gentry, both Irish and Anglo-Irish alike, composing for them. One of the last of the Irish harper-composers, whose music and words survive today in significant number, O&#8217;Carolan is considered Ireland&#8217;s &#8220;National Composer.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>O&#8217;Carolan&#8217;s Farewell to Music</i>, conceived and performed by Ball, and written by Ball and Peter Glazer, tells the harper&#8217;s story through the character of poet and harper Charles MacCabe, O&#8217;Carolan&#8217;s life-long friend and traveling companion. Through MacCabe&#8217;s eyes and O&#8217;Carolan&#8217;s music, we are drawn into this storm-tossed chapter of Irish history. Enriched by fourteen of O&#8217;Carolan&#8217;s beautiful melodies and the crystalline sound of Patrick&#8217;s harp, the play is charged with Irish wit and pathos, and demonstrates both the power of friendship and the vital role of the artist in troubled times.</p>

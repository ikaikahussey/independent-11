<p>BOARD BUSINESS:</p>

<p>Chair Lyons reminded those present to be respectful with comments regarding the presentation. It was stated that comments will be limited to three (3) minutes each with Pahinui keeping time.</p>

<p>Kaena Point Advisory Board Presentation: Chair William Aila of the Kaena Point Advisory Group (KPAG) noted that comments and questions regarding KPAG issues may be forwarded to KPAGcomments@gmail.com. Surveys and handouts were circulated to the Board. The purpose of the presentation is to gather public comment on recommendations and management at Kaena Point. The following was presented;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  KPAG History: KPAG was created on April 14, 2009 and is comprised of representatives from Government agencies and different groups with ties to Kaena Point. Groups represented include: North Shore Neighborhood Board, Friends of Kaena Point, Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Oahu Burial Council, Waianae Neighborhood Board, Camp Erdman, as well as fishermen, conservationists and cultural practitioners.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  KPAG Purpose: The purpose of KPAG is to advise the State Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) on the management of Kaena Point through recommendations developed through communication and involvement with the public and neighboring communities and users.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Areas of Consensus: KPAG representatives have agreed on the need for a designated road beyond the currently paved section. A designated road will assist in the protection and preservation of the sand dunes and Leina Ka Uhane while also allowing access to Kaena Point.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Designated Road Options: KPAG has proposed three (3) options for a designated road. The “Upper Road “option would lessen the amount of vehicular access to the shoreline. The “Loop Road” option would incorporate the upper road option but also allow for more access to the shoreline. The “Network Road” option would utilize several existing unpaved roads and allow the most shoreline access but would also cause erosion. The designated road will be created by lining the edge of existing unpaved roadways with rocks, plants and other natural resources.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Other Measures: KPAG is also looking into vehicle registry and the issuance of vehicle permits as additional methods to prevent improper practices and to promote preservation and responsible use of Kaena Point.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Future Steps: KPAG will review and analyze public comments and survey results, continue discussion and review of management at Kaena Point, present a written submittal of KPAG recommendations to BLNR and assist in the implementation of management plans at Kaena Point.</p>

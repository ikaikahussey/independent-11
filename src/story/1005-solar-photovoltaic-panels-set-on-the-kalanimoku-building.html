<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The State of Hawaii announced the completion of an installation of 1,005 solar photovoltaic panels on the Kalanimoku Building in the downtown Honolulu Capitol District this week. The panels are set to save 12 percent of the building&#8217;s electricity use, resulting in $300 of daily savings. </p>

<p>This is part of a large-scale effort to improve the energy efficiency for 10 office buildings in the Capitol District to reduce use of imported oil, keep the money that would have been spent on oil in Hawaii&#8217;s economy, and save taxpayer dollars, Gov. Neil Abercrombie said in a statement.</p>

<p>KAPAHULU&#8212;The new branch of Side Street Inn on Da Strip is a real boon to the Kapahulu community. The gathering spot offers up all of the deliciousness of the original Ala Moana location, plus things look a lot more tidy.</p>

<p>The new space has a sports bar feel but not in a bad way. It is comfy and cozy, and not overly masculine in its sensibility. It is just as inviting at 6:00 p.m. as it is at 10:00 p.m. and therefore attracts more families. There is also a swank private party room in back.</p>

<p>I took the family on a Saturday night at 6:00 p.m., stoked to have grabbed a last-minute reservation due to a cancellation. The UH game was on and the place was buzzing. Still, service was prompt and friendly just as it is at the original location.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The menu is the same, with a few specials that are definitely worth trying, like the boneless kalbi ribs with wilted watercress and kim chee. It costs $2.00 more than the regular kalbi but is worth every penny. The meat is so tender you can cut it with a fork.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Another fun change of pace is their take on carbonara, with fresh pillowy fettucine, local asparagus, and mushrooms, and your choice of salty Big Island smoked pork or succulent shrimp (or both, for those who can&#8217;t decide). Wash it all down with their special namesake beer brewed by Oregon&#8217;s Rogue brewery.&nbsp; Whether served from the tap or from the bottle, it is a fine ale worthy that suits Side Street&#8217;s take on comfort food.</p>

<p>Classic munchies in a clean, friendly environment makes for a great sports night venue for the entire family.</p>

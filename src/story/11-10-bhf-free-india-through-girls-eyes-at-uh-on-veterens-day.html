<p>The University of Hawaii at Manoa Outreach College&#8217;s Pacific New Media will present a free public lecture and slide presentation, titled &#8220;India through girls&#8217; eyes,&#8221; with Ramdas Lamb and Dana Forsberg, on Thursday, November 11 from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. The lecture happens on the UH Manoa campus in the Yukiyoshi Room, Krauss Hall 012.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ramdas Lamb, president and co-founder of the Sahayog Foundation and a professor of religion at UH Manoa, and photographer Dana Forsberg will discuss their on-going project teaching photography to rural girls in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh. </p>

<p>The project takes a look at the unique role of girls and women who are taking part in the elimination of poverty. The girls are not only learning technical skills, but also using photography as a method of self-expression, and for some, a profession. The work of the students is shown and the practical application of the project explored. </p>

<p>Lamb was a resident of India and sadhu (monk) from 1969 to 1978. He has been studying and working with villagers in Chhattisgarh since the mid-1970s. </p>

<p>Forsberg has exhibited her work at numerous venues, including Denver International Airport, Ron Judish Fine Arts in Denver, The Contemporary Museum at First Hawaiian Center in Honolulu, and the Incheon Art and Cultural Center in Incheon, Korea. Her work can be seen at <a href="http://www.danaforsberg.com" title="www.danaforsberg.com">www.danaforsberg.com</a>.</p>

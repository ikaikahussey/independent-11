<p>HALEIWA&#8212;Hula dancers, floats, a fire engine, and music are all part of the North Shore Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s (NSCC) 10th annual Christmas parade that is set to go on December 10. The parade will begin at 6:00 p.m. at the weed circle roundabout at the west end of Haleiwa, and will spread the cheer through Haleiwa ending at Haleiwa Beach Park at approximately 7:00 p.m. Over 40 units are planned for the hour-long Christmas celebration including bands, a local beauty queen, horse units, hula dancers, the fire engine, floats, and other forms of entertainment unique to the North Shore.</p>

<p>Other festivities include a photo op with Santa Clause, who will be available to visit with children off all ages before the parade begins at the North Shore Marketplace. Jolly old Saint Nick can be found under the monkeypod tree from 4:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and after the parade until 8:30 p.m. Photos of the children giving Santa their Christmas lists will be available from Island Style Images for $5. </p>

<p>Haleiwa&#8217;s wide variety of restaurants will be open and many shops will be offering sidewalk sales, in-store special, demonstrations, and other festivities. </p>

<p>The Chamber recommends that visitors arrive earlier than 5:30 p.m. in order to find parking in the town’s shopping centers or at the Historic Haleiwa Gym. Visitors are advised to bring a flashlight, umbrella, and lawn chairs or blankets to sit on. The main street will be closed for a little over one hour to make room for the parade and will re-open around 7:15 p.m. </p>

<p>According to the Chamber, this year’s theme will be “Celebrating the Chamber’s 25th Anniversary.” Charlene Terukina, who started the organization in 1985, will be the Grand Marshall. When Terukina founded the organization 25 years ago, its name at the time was the Haleiwa-Waialua Business and Professional Association. </p>

<p>The chamber is known also as Haleiwa Main Street. The NSCC’s mission is to promote, maintain, and encourage the historic, cultural, civic, and economic welfare of the North Shore district through research, education, and advocacy. A private non-profit corporation, the NSCC has completed several projects including negotiating the bypass design in 1995, raising money to restore the Waialua Courthouse, campaigning to repair and repaint the bridge in 1993, and raising money to install the three surfer Haleiwa Town signs on the bypass.</p>

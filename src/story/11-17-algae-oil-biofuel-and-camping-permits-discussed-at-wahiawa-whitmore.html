<p>The Wahiawa-Whitmore Village Neighborhood Board held their regular monthly meeting on October 18 to discuss a variety of community issues. </p>

<p>Residents expressed concerns about camping fees and noted that the process of retaining camping permits close to home has become difficult with the changes in the process. According to the meeting minutes, the Central Oahu resident said that the placement of the lines are uncomfortable, and it is not easy for working people to wait in line. The resident expressed that this leaves the process &#8220;easily accessible to the non-working people, which leaves camping sites filled with homeless who can wait in line.&#8221; </p>

<p>The Wahiawa property known as &#8220;Dr. DeHarne’s&#8221; was mentioned when a board member brought to the board’s attention that there was an open house at the site of Dr. DeHarne’s property. According to the meeting minutes, they are planning to build what appear to be condominiums. The board noted that the plans weren’t presented to the board and there was a question of whether it was approved for the residential area that it is in.</p>

<p>Keith Kurahashi, a consultant from Biomass to Energy (BTE) presented information on a proposed biofuel facility for Kunia where the facility would turn waste products into energy that would be less expensive than energy from Hawaii Electric Company. Community members expressed concerned about the process, safety and health issues, and how the facility would affect tax payers.</p>

<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Diamond Head Theatre brings the classic Louisa May Alcott novel to the stage this winter, in a Hawaii premiere of<i> Little Women, The Broadway Musical</i>. Set in Civil War America, the show portrays the four young March sisters as they navigate their ways through the later teen years, debating questions that will resonate with women today.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For artist Amy (Elise Levin), “What will I be when I grow up?” For independent Jo (Brittany Browning), “Will I settle down to marry or have a career?” For sensible and loyal Meg (Lydia Pusateri), “How will I feel about leaving the family home to marry?” For the fragile Beth (Meilan Akaka), “What does life hold?” With their father away at war, the girls look to their mother, “Marmee” March (Mary Hicks), for strength and guidance. As a musical, <i>Little Women</i> reinforces the theme of family solidarity&#8212;especially the powerful bond between sisters.</p>

<p><i>Little Women</i> is scheduled to run from December 3 to December 19. Performances are at 8:00 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 4:00 p.m. Sunday, and Saturday matinees at 3:00 p.m. on December 11 and 18. Single tickets are priced from $12 to $42, with discounts available for children under 18, full-time students, seniors 62 and older, and active-duty military. </p>

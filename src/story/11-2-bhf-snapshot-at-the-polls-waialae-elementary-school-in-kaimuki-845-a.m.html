I know I can vote early, I know I can vote absentee, but there&#8217;s something about showing up on Election Day itself that continues to hold its appeal for me&#8212;especially when I don&#8217;t have to wait in a long line.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The scene at Waialae Elementary in Kaimuki was mellow at 8:45 a.m. this morning. Apparently I had missed the morning rush, according to the volunteer at the door. In and out in about five minutes, I decided to linger and ask the first three people to leave after me the following question: Was there a particular issue or candidate that brought you out to the polls today?&nbsp; </p>

<p>The first woman, Mimi from Kaimuki, who looked roughly my age, didn&#8217;t point to anything in particular. She said she always tries to vote, especially since not many young people do. She said she votes &#8220;Democrat&#8221; to keep the Republicans out of office.</p>

<p>The next person to exit was also a young woman, but she declined to comment.</p>

<p>The third woman, Gwen, also from Kaimuki, hesitated for a brief moment before answering with a broad grin: Governor.</p>

<p>Then I got a strange look from the volunteer at the door, who asked me to put away my electronic devices.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Three random people with three different reactions, all of which seemed very honest. Not everyone is comfortable discussing their votes. Fair enough.&nbsp; Others tend to vote along strict party lines. Still others come out for one particular issue, or candidate.</p>

<p>Why did you get out and vote today?&nbsp; Or why not?&nbsp; And who did you vote for?&nbsp; Please leave your responses<a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/who-are-you-voting-for-and-why/" title=" here"> here</a>.</p>

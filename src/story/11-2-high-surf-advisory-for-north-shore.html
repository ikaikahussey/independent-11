<p>HALEIWA&#8212;The North Shore is expected to see waves approximately 15 to 20 feet today and a slightly smaller 10 to 15 feet for tomorrow. </p>

<p>According to <a href="http://Surfline.com" title="Surfline.com">Surfline.com</a>, a large NNW groundswell will peak today at 15 to 20 feet, approximately three to four times overhead with the occasional 25 foot sets. Larger sets are likely for select reefs. The surfing focused website is expecting today&#8217;s surf conditions to be &#8220;very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surfline also reported that on Wednesday we will see an easing NNW swell of approximately 10 to 15 feet which is an estimated two to three times overhead. Occasional 18 foot sets are expected for select reefs. The waves are expected to be biggest earlier in the day. Wednesday&#8217;s conditions are being called &#8220;good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remember to be careful on the beach and in the water. If in doubt, don&#8217;t go out.</p>

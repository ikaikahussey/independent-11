<p>HALEIWA&#8212;Operation: Toy Box, the annual even that collects brand new toys by donation to give out to houseless and underprivileged children on Christmas morning, is still seeking donations. The organization, which gave out over 500 toys to children and teens last year, currently has far below the estimated number or toys needed to give out, according to <i>North Shore News</i>. The organization is asking for members of the community to donate a brand new toy, which can be dropped off at various locations on the North Shore, Laie, Waialua, and Wahiawa.</p>

<p>Ron Valenciana, director of Operation: Toy Box, said approximately 2,000 new toys and other gifts will be needed to provide for the expected turnout of teens and children. He estimates that they will give out 400 bags of groceries this Christmas.</p>

<p>Operation: Toy Box is one element of an annual Christmas morning free breakfast held in the Haleiwa Post Office parking lot. The meal, which is provided by Turtle Bay Resort, begins at 8:00 a.m., with Santa Claus scheduled to arrive at 8:15 a.m., and toys will be given away between 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Anyone who is &#8220;homeless,&#8221; needy, underprivileged, senior citizen, or single who might otherwise spend the morning alone is invited to attend. Giveaways include bags of groceries for adults, and raffles for teens 13 to 17. Last year, over 250 families received bags of groceries and over 900 people ate a Christmas meal.</p>

<p>Toy drop-off locations can be found at Turtle Bay Resort, the North Shore Chamber of Commerce, Mokulani Properties, American Savings Bank, Jameson&#8217;s, Pizza Bob&#8217;s, the North Shore News, Paradise Real Estate in Wahiawa, and the Haircut Shop in Laie.</p>

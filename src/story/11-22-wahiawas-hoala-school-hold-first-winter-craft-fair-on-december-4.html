<p>Wahiawa&#8217;s Hoala School will be holding a winter craft fair on December 4, from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. The school&#8217;s first winter craft fair will feature a variety of craft, food, and specialty booths as well as activities for children.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The craft fair is the first of its kind, acting as a fundraiser for the Hoala School, which embeds community service programs into the curriculum in ways that are age appropriate to each grade. The school has partnered with various nonprofit and governmental agencies throughout the islands to help the students contribute to the community in a variety of creative ways.</p>

<p>In June, Hoala school was nationally recognized for two of their programs by the Character Education Partnership (CEP) in Washington, D.C. Hoala School recieved the Promising Practices Award for Camp Kokua, Learning by Serving, and the Hoala School Parent Teacher Study Group (PTSG).</p>

<p>The Central Oahu school, which serves students in grades K-12, was one of 196 schools awarded out of the 320 public and private schools from the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Singapore that applied for the Promising Practices award. </p>

<p>“These educators have found creative ways to improve school climate and, as a result, their students are learning more, doing the right thing, and giving back to others,” said Lara Maupin, associate director of National Schools of Character.</p>

<p>Hoala School was also recognized by the CEP in 2003.</p>

<p>In April 2010, Zoe Golonka, a second grader at Wahiawa’s Hoala School, won first place in her division and second place overall in the central region for the Wahiawa Lion’s Club “Sight is Beautiful” poster contest. Third grader David Yanaqawa won third place in his division.</p>

<p>Helen Keller was the inspiration for the Sight is Beautiful theme, and was also the inspiration for the Lion’s Club effort to create awareness for the blind. For the contest, the children were asked to show their appreciation of the gift of sight through their art.</p>

<p>The winter craft fair will take place on the school&#8217;s campus at 1067 A California Avenue in Wahiawa.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The musicians of the Honolulu Symphony, who last officially played together about a year ago under the auspices of the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra, will be performing a community concert, “110 Years of Master Works,” at St. Andrew’s Cathedral on Saturday, October 23, beginning at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The concert will feature three ensembles and is being presented by Live Music Awareness (LMA), a non-profit organization that promotes live music performed by professional musicians who call Hawaii home. LMA supported performances have helped to fill the void while the musicians’ employer, the Honolulu Symphony Society, struggles to emerge from bankruptcy. </p>

<p>This concert is underwritten in part through a grant to Live Music Awareness from the Ah Quon McElrath Fund for Economic and Social Justice as well as contributions from many generous individual donors. <br />
&nbsp;  <br />
In October 2009, just a few weeks into the new symphony season, the Honolulu Symphony Society abruptly halted concerts citing financial challenges and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2009. That left the musicians unemployed and the community without concerts.</p>

<p>“Many in the community tell us they miss their symphony concerts,” said Jonathan Parrish, spokesperson for the musicians. “Although we won’t be playing as one symphony in this concert, we believe that will happen again soon. In the meantime, this is a celebration of our 110-year history of service to the community and a reminder of what the musicians are working very hard to preserve.”</p>

<p>The concert will begin with a prelude by harpist Connie Uejio with flutist Claire Butin. The three ensembles will include a 35-piece string orchestra, a brass quintet, and a wind sextet. They will perform works by composers such as Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Vaughn Williams.&nbsp;  <br />
 <br />
“We now know what it’s like not to have a symphony. Unfortunately, we have taken our world-class musicians for granted,” said Lori Arizumi, a volunteer who has been actively promoting the restoration of symphony concerts. “There’s nothing like having our own musicians from Hawaii perform for us. We encourage all symphony lovers to come out and show their support. it will be thrilling to be in the cathedral for this special concert.” </p>

<p><I>Tickets are $25 for general admission; $20 for students, seniors 60-and-over, and active military. Tickets may be purchased at the door or online at <a href="http://www.honolulusymphonymusicians.org" title="www.honolulusymphonymusicians.org">www.honolulusymphonymusicians.org</a>.</I></p>

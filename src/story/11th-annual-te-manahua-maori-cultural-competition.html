<p>Celebrate the spirit of Aotearoa at the 11th Annual Te Manahua Maori Cultural Competition on Friday, August 13 and Saturday, August 14 at the Polynesian Cultural Center.</p>

<p>The purpose of the competition is to share and educate others about the Maori culture through song and dance.</p>

<p>The event features skilled Maori dancing to traditional music. Visuals will also include haka (male posture dance), poi (a graceful dance implement with the twirling ball on end of string) and visually stunning kahahu (attire).</p>

<p>Seamus Fitzgerald, who oversees Te Manahua 2010, has indicated that five senior kapa haka groups&#8212;two from the Laie area, two from New Zealand, and an expatriate Maori group from London, England&#8212;have confirmed they will participate in this year’s competition.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald added that six widely respected kapa haka judges from New Zealand would also make the trip to Laie for this year’s special Maori event. </p>

<p>“This year’s definitely going to be a strong competition, and the participants will be judged on all the categories,” Fitzgerald said. “Te Manahua 2010 is a really unique event. There’s nothing else like it in Hawaii that’s focused on Maori culture. ...&nbsp; I always get excited that we’re going to celebrate Maori culture in Hawaii.&#8221;</p>

<p>Admission to Te Manahua 2010 is included in the price of a regular Polynesian Cultural Center ticket or package.</p>

<p>Kamaaina or Hawaii residents may attend either the Friday evening or Saturday morning events for $10 for adults (ages 16-and-up) and $8 for children (ages 5-15).</p>

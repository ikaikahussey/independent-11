<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again. The big, white tents are up in Kapiolani Park. More runners than usual are making laps around Diamond Head, whizzing past so fast that you barely register their presence before they are poof!&#8212;gone.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Yes, the Honolulu Marathon is back. Come out this Sunday, December 12 and cheer on the runners. As a previous participant, I can attest that an enthusiastic crowd can make all the difference when the fatigue and pain sets in!&nbsp; </p>

<p>Expect road closures and traffic delays throughout East Oahu that morning.</p>

<p>NORTH SHORE&#8212;The Haleiwa Farmers Market, which draws thousands every week just outside of Haleiwa, will be relocating this Sunday, December 12 to due rainy weather conditions. At the time of publication, market organizers are still confirming one of two possible locations to temporary house the market over the rainy weekend. Market goers are being asked to follow the signs from the busy market&#8217;s usual location to find where vendors have been moved to.</p>

<p>At this Sunday&#8217;s market, Santa Clause will be there to take gift requests at Keiki Corner, the area that delivers fun for children located at the north end of the market.</p>

<p>North Shore Farms will also honor <a href="http://www.slowfood.com/terramadreday" title="Terra Madre Day">Terra Madre Day</a>, a world-wide tour that celebrates eating locally. It&#8217;s the mission of North Shore Farms owner Jeanne Vana’s to preserve our seasonal culinary traditions, sometimes literally. On Sunday, North Shore Farms presents &#8220;An Introduction to Canning: Preserving Bountiful Fresh Produce&#8221; found at the market. This holiday season, give the gift of food security preparedness.</p>

<p>Whether your reasons for food stocking are economical, environmental, political, or ecologically driven, North Shore Farms wants to help you get started. In 2011, look forward to a series of workshops to familiarize consumers with the process of sealing glass jars to preserve a big wave of fresh picked produce flavor for years to come.</p>

<p>Right now, 1,146 Terra Madre Days are being held in every corner of the world, in 124 different countries, <a href="http://www.terramadre.info/pagine/incontri/welcome.lasso?n=en" title="according to the Slow Food and Terra Madre network">according to the Slow Food and Terra Madre network</a>. From New Zealand to the Americas, Slow Food members, Presidium producers, food communities, cooks, academics, young people, and musicians have united in a collective global celebration of local food that’s good, clean, and fair. This year confirms the success of the first exciting edition in 2009, held on Slow Food’s 20th birthday, when 1,028 Terra Madre Days were held in 118 countries. </p>

<p>The objective of this year’s Terra Madre Day is to collect funds to finance the creation of a thousand vegetable gardens in Africa: in schools, in villages, on the outskirts of cities. The Terra Madre gardens will be run by the communities, planted with local varieties, and cultivated using sustainable techniques. The idea is not new, but comes from many agricultural and educational projects already ongoing in Kenya, Uganda, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Morocco, Ethiopia, Senegal and Tanzania. </p>

<p>Haleiwa Farmers Market will resume business at its regular location the following Sunday, December 19.</p>

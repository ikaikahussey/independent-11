<p>Safety Tip – Planning ahead can make Halloween a fire-safe one. Buy only costumes, wigs and props labeled flame resistant or flame retardant. If you are making your own costume, choose materials that will not easily burn. Avoid using costumes with billowing or long-trailing features. If your child is wearing a mask, ensure the eye holes are big enough so that vision is not obscured. Provide children with lightweight flashlights to carry for lighting. Dried flowers, cornstalks, and crepe paper are highly flammable. Keep these and other decorations away from open flames and/or heat generating sources, including light bulbs and heaters. For decorations, use simulated candles with battery powered lights.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   </p>

<p>Miller arrived at 7:05 p.m.; 11 members present.</p>

<p>Mayor Carlisle’s Representative – Alenka Remec reported;</p>

<p>Laniakea: There is currently no road work at Laniakea. Slow moving traffic is caused by tourists crossing the road to view the turtles on the beach.</p>

<p>Waimea Bay Parking: The Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) endeavors to provide as much park and recreational space as possible for users. There is always a need for more parking spaces and wherever and whenever feasible, parking lot expansion is considered.</p>

<p>Kamehameha Highway/Haleiwa Road: The proposed configuration at the intersection of Haleiwa Road and Kamehameha Highway does not include a traffic signal. The purpose of the reconfiguration is to improve traffic operations by better channelizing traffic at the intersection.</p>

<p>Sunset Beach Bike Path: The Department of Facility Maintenance (DFM) is taking a two pronged approach to addressing the damaged bike path. An interim approach will include:<br />
Structurally stabilizing the bike path where it has been undermined.<br />
Working with the Department of Design and Construction (DDC) to arrange for large sand bags to be placed to protect the bike path from erosion.<br />
Pushing sand to cover the sand bags and restore the beach area.</p>

<p>The Department of Transportation Services (DTS) and DDC will look to implement a more permanent protection for the bike path. One option may be a “keystone” wall that was originally proposed in the 1990’s.&nbsp; The SMA permit for this wall is still valid, but we need to verify that this is still doable given the changed conditions in the area.&nbsp; This measure will take longer to implement, approximately two years at a minimum.</p>

<p>7-Eleven Intersection: The City is aware and is working with 7-Eleven in relation to the proposed intersection improvements at Kamehameha Highway and Haleiwa Road.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed;</p>

<p>Replacement: Remec was thanked for the service rendered toward the North Shore community. It was reported that Jim Fulton will be the new Mayor’s representative to the Board.</p>

<p>Keala O Pupukea: Gratitude was expressed for repairs to Keala O Pupukea; however, it was expressed that the repairs took too long.</p>

<p>Process: It was expressed that park lands area community asset. Information regarding the City process of selling park lands was requested.</p>

<p>Proceeds: It was suggested that if park lands abutting the Jameson property are sold, proceeds should go towards improving Haleiwa Beach Park. It was further suggested that lands north of the City parcel should be developed as well.</p>

<p>Park Land Sale: It was suggested that park lands abutting the Jameson property not be sold. It was noted that the area is heavily used by the public.</p>

<p>Kaukonahua Road: It was noted that a presentation regarding access to properties from Kaukonahua Road had been made to the Wahiawa Neighborhood Board. It was expressed that the current access and egress on Kaukonahua Road is dangerous. It was suggested that access to the properties from Kaukonahua Road should either be restricted or improved.</p>

<p>Fire Hazard: It was noted that there was a fire violation during the September meeting due to the lack of space at the John Kalili Surf Center. It was requested that doors be unscrewed to allow for a larger crowd. It was noted that the center is currently being assessed for possible repairs.</p>

<p>Remec introduced Jim Fulton to the North Shore Neighborhood Board.</p>

<p>Board of Water Supply – George Kuo and Sandy Nahoopii-Soong reported;</p>

<p>Ultra-Low Flow Toilet Rebate Program: BWS and the City Department of Environmental Services (ENV) will be ending its residential Ultra-Low Flow Toilet Rebate Program at the end of 2010. Property owners wishing to participate in the program must submit applications to BWS by Friday, December 31, 2010. Applications that are properly completed and postmarked by that date will be honored, pending available funds. The BWS toilet rebate program has been in effect since 1994 and was originally scheduled to sunset on July 1, 2008; however, BWS and ENV committed to continue funding the program because it help save Oahu’s precious water supply and reduced the flow into the City’s sewer system. The program has saved more than 4.6 billion gallons of potable water on Oahu.</p>

<p>Safety and Security at BWS Properties and Facilities: With concerns about national security, and the increasing problem of theft and vandalism of public property, BWS has been proactive in its efforts to protect the safety of Oahu’s water supply. However, having the community as a partner to help the BWS keep an eye on its various properties, especially the remote ones, is something that is very important. Any suspicious activity occurring at a BWS should first be reported to HPD. After HPD has been contacted, please place a follow up call to BWS at 748-5911.</p>

<p>Water Conservation Tips: Collect Rainwater for outdoor irrigation. A thousand square feet of roof or sloped surface can collect 420 gallons of water from just an inch of rain. Be mindful in turning off the shower when lathering or shutting off the faucet when shaving or brushing teeth. Doing this can save up to 56 gallons a week. For more information visit www.boardofwatersupply.com.</p>

<p>Kamehameha Highway Water Line Project: BWS will be planning a water line connection on Friday, November 19, 2010 during evening hours at the Kamehameha Highway/Pupukea Road intersection. The 16 inch waterline will be shut off at 11:00 p.m.; however, the eight (8) inch line will remain operational. Residents from Turtle Bay to Waimea Bay will be asked to conserve water during the water line connection. The project is anticipated to commence Friday night and end Saturday. Information will be disseminated to residents as the project approaches.</p>

<p>Councilmember Donovan Dela Cruz – Councilmember Donovan Dela Cruz reported on six (6) proposed City charter amendments that will be on the November 2, 2010 ballot. The proposed charter amendments will address the following:<br />

In response to a resident’s concern, the Kaiaka Bay supervisor will better monitor the mowing activities. The City Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) had agreed to involve several community members to work on the community planning of the Pupukea master plan. It was noted that the State Department of Health (DOH) inspects lunch wagons every two (2) years; however, any complaint will be responded to. Two (2) types of parking regulation signs will be posted along the North Shore. It was noted that the Public Transit Authority would need to follow rules on the sunshine law.</p>

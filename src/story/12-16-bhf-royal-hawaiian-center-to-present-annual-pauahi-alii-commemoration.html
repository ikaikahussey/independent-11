<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;In honor of the memory of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, great-granddaughter of King Kamehameha I, Royal Hawaiian Center presents its annual Pauahi Alii Commemoration on Thursday, December 16, at noon.</p>

<p>Kahu David Kaupu, retired chaplain of Kamehameha Schools, will preside over the commemoration. Halau Mohala Ilima under the direction of Kumu Hula Mapuana de Silva will offer a traditional hula in Pauahi&#8217;s honor.&nbsp; Halau o ke Aalii Ku Makani, under the direction of Royal Hawaiian Center&#8217;s cultural director, Kumu Hula Manu Boyd, will perform &#8220;Hanohano Helumoa,&#8221; the Na Hoku Hanohano Hawaiian song of the year, composed for Princess Pauahi and her Waikiki lands. The Royal Hawaiian Band will bring the commemoration to a close with their semi-monthly concert at 1:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The event is free and open to the public, and will be held in The Royal Grove. Members of Hawaiian royal societies are expected to attend, and will present hookupu (tributes) of flower lei at the statue of Princess Pauahi in The Royal Grove created by Kamehameha graduate Sean Browne.</p>

<p>Princess Pauahi was born December 19, 1831 to High Chief Abner Paki and Kamehameha&#8217;s moopuna (granddaughter), High Chiefess Laura Konia, during the reign of her cousin Kauikeaouli â€“ King Kamehameha III.</p>

<p>Royal Hawaiian Center is part of the estate of Bernice Pauahi Bishop, located at Helumoa, Waikiki, inherited from her Kamehameha ohana. Before her passing in 1884, Pauahi and her husband, Charles Reed Bishop, spent time at their &#8220;country home,&#8221; Helumoa, where the last council of her will was completed, establishing Kamehameha Schools for the education of Hawaiian children.&nbsp; In 1887, Kamehameha School for Boys opened at Kaiwiula, Honolulu.&nbsp; For 30 years, Royal Hawaiian Center at Helumoa has generated revenue in support of Kamehameha Schools with campuses at Kapalama, Oahu; Keaau, Hawaii and Pukalani, Maui; as well as statewide early education programs.</p>

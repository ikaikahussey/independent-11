<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) will close the Waikiki-Diamond Head Shoreline Fisheries Management Area (FMA) on Oahu to fishing for one year, beginning January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.</p>

<p>“Closing this nearshore area to all fishing in odd-numbered years has been the historical means of replenishing fish populations. Opening them in even-numbered years then offers a good fishing experience,” said William J. Aila, Jr., the new DLNR Chairperson.</p>

<p>The fisheries management area encompasses the nearshore waters between the Ewa wall of the Waikiki War Memorial Natatorium and the Diamond Head Lighthouse, and from the high-water mark on shore to a minimum seaward distance of 500 yards, or to the edge of the fringing reef if one occurs beyond 500 yards.</p>

<p>The FMA is regulated by the Departments administrative rule, Chapter 13-48. It is prohibited to fish for, take, or injure any marine life (including eggs) or to possess in the water any fishing gear during the “closed to fishing” period.</p>

<p>Fishing is also not allowed at any time in the adjoining Waikiki Marine Life Conservation District (MLCD) between the Ewa edge of the Natatorium and the Ewa edge of the Kapahulu groin (seawall).</p>

<p>Anyone who violates the provisions of this rule may be guilty of a petty misdemeanor, and /or subject to an administrative fine.</p>

<p><i>Copies of the administrative rule, Chapter 13-48 are available at the Division of Aquatic Resources office, 1151 Punchbowl Street, Rm. 330, in the Hawaii Fishing Regulations booklet (available at most sporting goods stores), or on the DLNR website at <a href="http://www.hawaii.gov/dlnr/dar" title="www.hawaii.gov/dlnr/dar">www.hawaii.gov/dlnr/dar</a>.</i></p>

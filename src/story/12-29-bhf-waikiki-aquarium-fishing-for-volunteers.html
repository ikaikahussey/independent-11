<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;The Waikiki Aquarium offers an ocean of opportunities to teach residents and visitors about Hawaii sea life and conservation. Fish lovers can be a part of the fun by attending the Aquarium&#8217;s free volunteer training beginning Saturday, January 22.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the job of volunteer Aquarium Interpreters to share the natural history information on the Waikiki Aquarium’s outdoor reef exhibit, guide visitor observations, and answer questions about Hawaii’s marine environment. The training course covers interpretation and hospitality skills, information on exhibit operations, and various marine sciences.</p>

<p>Eight training sessions will be held January 22 to February 15, 2011 every Tuesday from 6:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to noon in the Waikiki Aquarium classroom. One-on-one sessions will then be scheduled for on-the-job training. Interpreters work one two-hour shift per week for a minimum period of six months.</p>

<p><i>Call (808) 440-9020 or e-mail volunteer@waquarium.org for more information or to schedule a meeting and reserve space in the class. </i></p>

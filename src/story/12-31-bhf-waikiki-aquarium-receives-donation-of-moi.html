<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;In the wake of <a href="http://www.kitv.com/news/25198919/detail.html" title="the moi theft earlier this year">the moi theft earlier this year</a>, in which thieves broke into the Waikiki Aquarium after closing and took 15 of 21 fish in an outdoor circular tank, the aquarium received a donation of 300 moi fingerlings from the Hawaii Pacific University’s Oceanic Institute. </p>

<p>Currently being raised behind the scenes, the moi will go on display in the spring. The Waikiki Aquarium also plans to release some of the fish into the ocean as part of its Earth Day event in April.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“We’re so grateful for this donation from the Hawaii Pacific University’s Oceanic Institute as it will allow us to better serve as a community and educational resource about the Pacific Threadfin, or moi,” said Director Andrew Rossiter, Ph.D. “This exhibit is truly unique in that it highlights Hawaii’s role as a world-leader in this field of aquaculture and also shares the moi’s cultural significance as the fish of Hawaiian royalty.”</p>

<p>In addition to the moi donation, fifth-grade students and faculty of King William Lunalilo Elementary School raised and donated $112.39, which will be used to support the raising of the moi.</p>

<p>Police continue to investigate the September theft, a loss estimated at $1,500.</p>

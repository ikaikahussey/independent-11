<p>HALEIWA&#8212;For the third year in a row, the North Shore Food Bank won first place in the Hawaii Food Bank&#8217;s 2010 Annual Hunger Walk.</p>

<p>Over $109,000 was raised at this year&#8217;s Hunger Walk, which benefited Oahu&#8217;s food pantries, feeding programs, soup kitchens, &#8220;homeless&#8221; and abuse shelters, and rehabilitation centers.</p>

<p>The North Shore Foodbank, spearheaded by <I><a href="http://www.northshorenews.com/" title="North Shore News">North Shore News</a></I> publisher Ron Valenciana, provides emergency non-perishable food supplies to Oahu residents in the North Shore area who meet eligibility requirements. Recipients must meet income eligibility, submit a written application, and attend an interview. Food is distributed on the last Tuesday of each month from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., as well as a produce distribution on the fourth Friday of every month at the Waialua Community Association, locally known as the &#8220;old gym&#8221; across from the Haleiwa Post Office.</p>

<p>Not all of the recipients are homeless, according to <i>North Shore News</i>. Many community members who accept food from the food bank are senior citizens on a fixed income as well as working low-income families. The North Shore Food Bank reported that they distributed over 1,000 bags of food last month, each with approximately 10 to 12 cans of food.</p>

<p>Community members can donate food at the <i>North Shore News</i> headquarters, located in Haleiwa at 66-437 Kamehameha Hwy. Suite #210&#8212;above the Haleiwa Post Office.</p>

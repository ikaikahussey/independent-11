<p>Dr. Thauna Abrin, naturopathic doctor, will be at <a href="http://www.babyawearness.com/" title="Baby Awearness">Baby Awearness</a> on December 14 at 6:30 p.m.&nbsp; for a discussion on how to treat autism and ADHD through natural, drug-free, non-invasive therapies. Learn about the success of these therapies including dietary changes, vitamins, detoxification, and homeopathic medicines. This class is directed toward parents, caregivers, teachers, and families.</p>

<p>Abrin approaches autism and ADHD through the <a href="http://www.defeatautismnow.com/" title="DAN! (Defeat Autism Now)">DAN! (Defeat Autism Now)</a> approach. A graduate of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon, Abrin has 10 years of experience as a naturopathic doctor and midwife in both Hawaii and California. In her practice, Abrin utilizes herbs, homeopathy, detoxification, and craniosacral therapy to facilitate healing. She developed a special interest in treating women and children with conditions caused by environmental toxins and treats ADHD, autism, thyroid disorders, and gynecological disorders.</p>

<p>Her recently published book, <i>The Green Pregnancy Diet</i>, examines non-toxic nutrition and lifestyle during pregnancy. Abrin&#8217;s focus is on educating people about natural treatments for ADHD and autism. She relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2006 and returns to Honolulu three times a year to offer an ADHD and autism spectrum clinic.</p>

<p>LANIKAI &#8212; The <strong>First Annual Lanikai Surf Festival</strong> takes place over the weekend of September 23-24 at Lanikai Park, featuring a wide variety of activities from surf films to a 2.4 stand up paddle (SUP) race. The public is invited to picnic and enjoy free evening surf movie screenings by renowned filmmakers, and browse booths stocked for and by local watermen and women. Lanikai, a quiet, friendly beach community, seems the perfect place to hold an event that celebrates the ocean lifestyle.</p>

<p>Friday’s movies include <em>Wateman</em> by legendary surf photographer Don King.“Talk story” sessions will feature revered surfers, shapers, photographers, and surfing industry veterans on Saturday, and a surf museum and surfing-themed craft fair will be held. </p>

<p>All of the event proceeds will benefit AccesSurf, an non-profit organization that strives to provide recreation opportunities to people with disabilities, the Wounded Warrior Project, an organization which exists to honor and empower wounded warriors who incur service-connected wounds, injuries, and illnesses on or after September 11, 2001, and the Lanikai Association to support their efforts in maintaining Lanikai Public Park and retaining the residential feel of the community.</p>

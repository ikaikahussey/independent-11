<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A piece of chocolate is at the desk of every State representative today to announce the importance of supporting an industry that is exclusive to Hawaii in the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;February is the month to support the local cacao industry in Hawaii,‚Äù said Hawaii Rep. Corinne Ching (R), who was responsible for the day&#8217;s chocolate awareness campaign. Ching represents Nuuanu, Puunui, Liliha, and Alewa Heights.</p>

<p>A measure was adopted by the Legislature last year to make February the official &#8220;Hawaii Grown Cacao Month.&#8221;</p>

<p>The largest grower, Dole Food Co., has about 13,000 trees on 20 acres in Waialua on Oahu&#8217;s North Shore. There are 30 farmers growing cacao in the state, and about 100 acres of cacao. </p>

<p>According to the State Agriculture Department, there is potential for cacao farming to cover 315 acres to 3,000 acres on the island.</p>

<p><i>On Saturday, February 26, from noon until 5:00 p.m., there will be a celebration of cacao at the Hawaii Chocolate festival at Dole Cannery . </p>

The development will be located southeast of Meheula Parkway between Kuaoa Street and Lehiwa Drive on 7.5 acres of a B-2 Community Business zoned lot. A self storage facility occupies the remaining 1.5 acres of the property. The project site is located next to a park site which is adjacent to Mililani Middle School.&nbsp; Mililani Elementary Schools is located further east on Meheula Parkway.<br />
&nbsp;   * Rental Development Plans – Plans are to have a senior affordable rental development consisting of four buildings each with a two-story and three-story wing, to be constructed in four phases. Each building will contain 75 one-bedroom senior units with 33 parking stalls. A two-bedroom resident manager&#8217;s unit will be included in Phase 1.

&nbsp;   * Property Zoning – The property is zoned B-2 for commercial use with a 60-foot height limit.<br />

<p>A lengthy discussion followed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;  2. Traffic Generated Impacts – Increase traffic in an already traffic impacted area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  3. 201H Category – Under the 201H category if 40% of the units are not rented, could the units be rented at </p>

<p>market costs? Federal standard require that rentals be according to income brackets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  5. Parking Restrictions Per Resident – a) Are there exemptions allowing one parking stall per unit?</p>

<p>Audience Members –. Approximately 30 guests gave testimony in opposition for the following reasons:</p>

<p>&nbsp;  1. Planned Community – Mililani Mauka is a planned community and the property should remain commercial use. Since Mauka is at its developing capacity, how much more underground infrastructure must be put in to accommodate this new development? Agreements were signed with Castle &amp; Cooke at the closing of purchasing a home that this is a planned community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  2. Board Members – The Board is here to support the majority which is in opposition to the project. The Board should think of the community&#8217;s best interest that no new residential development is built on the commercial lot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  3. Oahu Arts Center – Many in attendance continue support having an arts center on the site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  4. Citizens Against Residential Expansion Mililani (Care Mililani) – A handout was circulated with concerns, and The Board was asked to consider the community&#8217;s opposition and promises made to the community by Castle &amp; Cooke.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  5. Visitors – If there are no restrictions on visitations, what is to prevent overnight stays and who would be enforcing the rules?</p>

<p>&nbsp;  6. No Development – Community members do not want housing on the proposed lot; the property should be left for a park, art center, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  7. Profit – If the monthly profit is about $336,000, how much of the profit goes to the Catholic Charities, the developer, and the community.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  8. School Concerns – The schools are already overcrowded and more school space is needed in Mauka. It was suggested that the property be sold to the State, State Department of Education (DOE), or keep Castle &amp; Cooke&#8217;s promise for the arts center.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  9. Board Stand – The Board was asked to take a stand and override Castle &amp; Cooke&#8217;s promises. The Board was asked what could be done to stop the project.</p>

<p>8:22 p.m. Agader departed the meeting; 7 member present.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 10. Tax Credits – Low income project receive tax credits. Will the developer or the renters get the tax credits? There are many people 55 and older still working.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 11. Castle &amp; Cooke – Bruce Barrett explained that the key issue is change. There is a lack of demand for commercial use. Changes were made to the master plan due to economic circumstances.</p>

<p>9:10 p.m. Costales departed the meeting; 6 members present.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 12. Services Provided by Catholic Charities – Catholic Charities have many different services are provided island wide and this facility would be added to the transportation program already utilized on Oahu.</p>

<p>9:17 p.m. Oishi departed the meeting; 5 members present.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 15. Rental Costs – Per the handout the units will be available to seniors earning less than 60% of the median income which should be about $700 per month.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 16. End of 60-Year Term – At the end of the term the project would continue into the future.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 17. Board of Directors – The project would be governed by a Board of Directors. Danny Ontai, Subsidiary of Catholic Charities Housing was introduced. Ontai oversees 300 staff members, 30 programs state wide, and funding from different government agencies.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 18. Guests were reminded that all questions be addressed to the Chair.</p>

<p>Due to audience member continuing speaking out of turn, Chair Hazama once again reminded everyone that the meeting will be conducted in a civil manner, respect given to all opinions and viewpoints. If the outbursts continued a recess would be called or the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Ellis called a point of order to take the last speaker. The neighborhood assistant explained to the Chair that per the Sunshine Law all persons wishing to speak must have a turn.</p>

<p>Chair Hazama reiterated that the Board&#8217;s capacity is advisory only. The issue will go forward to City Council and HHFDC would have hearings. Several audience members were intimidating the Board by aggressively reminding Board member that the community votes them on to the Board and can vote them off.</p>

<p>Suwa moved that a letter be sent to the State, City, and entities involved in the decision process in support of the project with conditions.</p>

<p>Discussion followed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;  1. Ellis amended the motion that a strong letter from the Board be sent in opposition to the project; and that the CARE Mililani handout be attached.&nbsp; Suwa accepted the amendment and said that he would accept any other testimony that could be provided.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  2. Tamashiro commented that there is a need for affordable senior housing; but agreed with the testimonies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  3. Suwa supports the community and is personally against the project, personally against the project, for clarification the Board represents the Mauka residents and try the best they can. He has heard no support from the audience. The main point is the need. Chair said that he understands where the community is coming from, however it is hard not supporting a senior project. He shares the community&#8217;s frustrations, and the inability of attracting commercial businesses to the area. However, the Board must represent all of </p>

<p>Mauka residents; the decision is difficult for the Board. Those types of facilities are needed in communities to care for seniors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  4. Suwa explained that a letter of support with condition be sent because if only a letter of opposition is sent it will be difficult to add conditions after the fact. The community was asked what is acceptable if no projects are wanted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  5. Comment to Board Members: Concern was focused on Board members reminding them that the community voted them to the board and could vote them off. </p>

<p>Suwa withdrew the motion. Ellis mentioned to table the motion, but the motion was already withdrawn.</p>

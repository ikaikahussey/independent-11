<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;To celebrate its 24th year, the Kaimuki High School Performing Arts Center will be performing <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, the popular comic operetta written by Gilbert and Sullivan. It will feature a rollicking band of pirates led by their swashbuckling Pirate King, a shrewd but stuffy Major General with a bevy of beautiful daughters, a pair of young lovers wrenched apart by misunderstanding and a misguided sense of duty, a police force reminiscent of the Keystone Cops, and a happy ending (of course). </p>

<p>The enthusiastic and talented actors represent various public schools from Hawaii including Kaimuki, Aiea, and Kalani High Schools and Washington, Dole, and Kaimuki Middle Schools. Also represented are students from Myron Thompson Academy and Hokulani, Lehua, and Kahala Elementary Schools.</p>

<p><i>The Pirates of Penzance</i> will be performed on February 18, 19, 25 and 26; March 4 and 5 at 7:30 p.m.; and February 27 and March 6 at 3:00 p.m. With ID, elementary and high school students, military, and seniors citizens over 65 are $6. Adult tickets are $12. Box office opens 30 minutes before each performance for ticket sales. Tickets are also on sale at Harryâ€™s Music Store and online at <a href="http://honoluluboxoffice.com" target="_blank>honoluluboxoffice.com</a>.</p>

<p><i>Kaimuki High School Theatre is located at 2705 Kaimuki Ave., between Kapahulu Avenue and Kapiolani Boulevard. For more information, contact Joanne Libarios at (808) 733-4913 or jlibarios@gmail.com.</i></p>

<p>The Kalihi-Palama Neighborhood Board met Wednesday, January 19, with representatives of the Honolulu Police Department, Honolulu Fire Department, and representatives of legislators from districts in the board’s jurisdiction in attendance. Representatives from Honolulu Rail Transit, the Hawaiian Humane Society, and The Slippah Foundation were also present.</p>

<p>HPD’s Sgt. Brent Bonnell reported on HPD District 5 December 2010 response statistics, which included 97 thefts, 24 assaults, 26 burglaries, 15 DUI offenses, and 246 motor vehicle collisions. The increase in traffic incidents can be attributed, in part, to an increase in the number of vehicles on the road during the holidays, and increased enforcement of DUI offenses.</p>

<p>Hawaiian Humane Society Managerial Outreach Director Bonnie Osaki introduced a program to engage students in animal welfare. Kalihi is one of four areas under-served by HHS that have been selected for the outreach program.</p>

<p>Kalihi is the second area to participate, with a panel of 12 Waianae students having already held events such as free micro-chipping for pets, spay/neuter appointment scheduling, and expert pet advice from an animal behaviorist.</p>

<p>Kalihi students selected to a panel will be given a full day of training at HHS in animal welfare, team building, and program development. The students will also receive mentoring during the next academic semester. More information and applications are <a href="http://www.hawaiianhumane.org/student_activism.html">available here</a>.</p>

<p>It was also noted by HHS that as of July 2010, it is illegal to secure a dog to a fixed structure with a choke, prong, or pinch collar.</p>

<p>State Representative Manahan’s office reported that he has met with the federal Housing and Urban Development and the KPT Housing Association regarding a public-private partnership to modernize and refurbish Kalihi Park Terrace, in cooperation with the Michaels Development Corporation, which specializes in securing federal funding for and managing housing developments.</p>

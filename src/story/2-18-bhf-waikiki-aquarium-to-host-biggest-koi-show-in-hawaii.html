<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;On February 19 and 20, the Waikiki Aquarium will be hosting the biggest koi show in Hawaii. The 4th Annual International Aloha Koi Show is set to feature hundreds of top-quality koi on display in addition to educational seminars, keiki activities, and live entertainment such as ninja group demonstrations, taiko drummers, and hula dancers.</p>

<p>“We’re so pleased and honored to be able to host one of the major koi shows in the United States here on the Aquarium grounds as an added value to our guests,” said Waikiki Aquarium Director Andrew Rossiter, Ph.D. “Nishikigoi (brocaded carp), more commonly referred to simply as ‘koi’, originated in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The variety of beautiful colors and patterns we see today are the result of over 200 years of artificial selection by dedicated breeders there. Koi is the national fish of Japan and are also widely prized by collectors around the world. Sometimes referred to as ‘living jewels,’ to many, they epitomize an aesthetic and cultural bridge between East and West.”</p>

<p>The 4th Annual International Koi Show will take place from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, February 19 and from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 20. Entry is free to Aquarium visitors.</p>

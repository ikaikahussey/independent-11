<p>HALEIWA&#8212;The North Shore Neighborhood Board will be holding a special meeting tonight regarding the proposed Haleiwa Hotel by developer Andy Anderson.</p>

<p>Anderson has plans to construct a “boutique” hotel that would be an exact replica of the original Haleiwa Hotel built in 1898. </p>

<p>The proposed development has become a subject of controversy among North Shore residents. Some community members oppose Anderson’s plan because they believe a hotel in Haleiwa will only increase traffic, while others disagree with the decision of the City and County of Honolulu selling land intended for a regional park—to a private developer.</p>

<p>Yet the hotel has supporters, too, including the North Shore Chamber of Commerce (NSCC) who cite the need for more accommodations on the North Shore. The NSCC noted the high number of illegal vacation rentals on the North Shore, which lead to decreased housing availability and high rents for residents, as well the the historical aspect, as a reason to move forward with the hotel.</p>

<p>The special meeting will be held Wednesday, February 2 at 7:00 p.m. at the Waialua Community Association across from the Haleiwa Post Office.</p>

Chromium VI (Hexavalent Chromium) Concerns – A chromium report released last month suspected carcinogen in water supplies around the country. BWS is committed to protecting health and takes seriously any information about potential drinking water contaminants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in the process of reviewing Health effects data to determine if a new standard is needed and also developing guidance on monitoring for Chromium VI. In the mean time, BWS decided to start assessing the extent of Chromium VI presence in our water supplies by collecting and testing samples and developing a sampling plan in consultation with State Department of Health (DOH).<br />
Water Conservation Contest and Calendar – The 2011 Water Conservation Poster &amp; Poetry Contest is open to all Oahu schoolchildren.

For a contest entry form and rules or general information, visit www.boardofwatersupply.org or call 748-5041.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns:</p>

<p>Chromium VI – Chromium VI is a natural compound found in volcanic type soil. According to the Environmental Protective Agency (EPA) chromium level is .32 parts per billion. Recent tests shows four parts per million.</p>

<p>Home Filters – Filters may help but do not filter out all of the chromium; it is suspected carcinogens and there is no reasonable concern.</p>

<p>Honolulu Rail Transit (HRT) – Pat Lee reported the following:</p>

<p>Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) Governor Abercrombie accepted the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Honolulu Rail Transit Project on December 16, 2010. The Programmatic Agreement is completed, and the Federal Transit Administration issued a Record of Decision (ROD) on January 18, 2011. The ROD is the last step in the environmental process and it allows the City to break ground on the rail transit system. The ROD also allows the City to move forward to finalizing engineering and design work, and applying for a full funding grant for the anticipated $1.55 Billion in federal funds to<br />
build the project. As with all construction projects, there are grading and building permits, NPDES permits for pollution control, street usage permits, etc. </p>

<p>Because five small areas of the 20-mile rail alignment are within Special Management Area (SMA) or touch the SMA, an SMA use permit is needed.&nbsp; The SMA addresses coastal zone resources and shoreline impacts. It is not specific to rail; any project in the SMA valued over $125,000 requires an SMA Major permit. The SMA application was approved by the City Council today (January 26, 2011) by a vote of 8-0. There have been some concerns raised about the status of Federal funding with Republicans now controlling the US House of Representatives. Mayor Carlisle and US Rep. Mazie Hirono met with new House Transportation and Infrastructure Chair John Mica (R-Fla) who replaced Oberstar after the fall elections, and he pledged his support for Honolulu’s rail project, particularly with the strong local backing for it. The City has already awarded two construction contracts for the project: one for the first phase of the elevated rail guideway from East Kapolei to Pearl City; and the other for the train storage and maintenance facility in Waipahu. The city is scheduled to award two more contracts this year for the second phase of the rail route from Pearl City to Aloha Stadium and for the &#8220;core systems,&#8221; which consists of the train vehicles and the control center for the rail system.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns:<br />
School Concerns – Regarding no mention of middle or high school, the State Department of Education (DOE) agreed upon a location for the Waiawa Ridge project. However, during the interim for the Koa Ridge project the Pearl City complex and other area schools would be used.</p>

<p>Traffic Concerns – a) Traffic issues are being addressed with the project including a major employment center. The Waipio Interchange improvements would include additional loop ramps. State Department of Transportation (DOT) Highway Modernization Plan includes a p.m. contra-flow. Benefits of the rail transit would be the incorporating a new off-ramp from the H-2 Freeway to the Pearl Highlands Transit Station. The widening of Ka Uka Boulevard will coincide with the development.</p>

<p>Agriculture Land – A sustainable agriculture policy must be developed to help farmers export products.</p>

<p>Apartments – Bedroom for low-density apartment varies. Approximately 3,500 units will be built (3 occupants per household).</p>

<p>Funding – Where is the funding coming from and how will the community benefit.</p>

<p>Mililani Mauka Residents – a) Several residents spoke in opposition to the proposed Meheula Vista Senior Affordable Housing. The residents aggressively imposed their opinion to Board that the community votes them to the Board and could vote Board members off. Board members were encouraged to take a stand with Mililani Mauka residents and vote no to the senior affordable housing. b) Board member Weinberger took offense by the tone used to Board members. c) Board member Siegel explained that Mililani Mauka and Mililani Waipio are two separate Boards and that the Mauka community does not vote for the Mililani Town side board members. d) Another Mauka resident said that they are not here to attack Board members, but are frustrated and asked for the Board’s understanding.</p>

<p>REPORTS OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS:</p>

<p>Mayor Peter Carlisle’s Representative – Tofi Mika, Jr. reported the following:</p>

<p>Speeding on Kipapa Drive – From September 1 and October 28, 2010, there were 10 motor vehicle collisions in the area. Nine were minor collisions and were non-traffic related because they occurred on private property. HPD makes regular checks of the area for speeders and will continue to monitor the area. Speed monitoring is not practical because there is traffic congestion at different times of the day from residences and the shopping center. Only one (1) speed limit sign is posted on Kipapa Drive. Call Captain Moana Heu, HPD, District 2 – Wahiawa at 621 – 3725 with any questions.</p>

<p>DMV Health Application – The Board member with this concern was contacted based upon previous complaints regarding requirements to submit the State Department of Transportation Medical form as a condition to renew her driver license.

The concerns should be addressed to the State Department of Transportation.<br />

Funding for the resurfacing by contract of Meheula parkway (from Lanikuhana Avenue, west, to the H-2 Freeway and Anania Drive from Meheula Parkway to the roadway’s end have been requested to be programmed in the fiscal year 2011-2012 CIP budget pending funding availability.<br />
Homelessness/Affordable Housing or Rentals – The City is committed to its housing policy of supporting the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing, including rental units. Specific goals are set forth in the City’s Consolidated Plan (July1, 2010 – June 15, 2015, Final July 2009) which presently calls for 250 affordable housing or special needs housing units to be constructed or preserved with the highest priority to homeless and very low-income renter households.<br />

RESOLUTION REQUESTING THAT THE COMMUNITY ROOM LOCATED IN THE MILILANI BUS TRANSIT TERMINAL BE OPENED FOR COMMUNITY USE</p>

<p>WHEREAS, the concept of including a community room as part of the Mililani Transit Center was based upon the need for additional community meeting space and adopted as a Mililani Vision Team project; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, a community room was built as part of the Mililani Transit Center, located at the Mililani Town Center, which was dedicated in August 2007, and</p>

<p> WHEREAS, it was the intent of the Vision Team and those attending the dedication ceremony that the room would be primarily for community use such as but not limited to community meetings; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, years have passed since the dedication of this much-needed and appreciated public facility without a program of how the community may access and use the community meeting room, primarily because of the lack of a City &amp;County presence or facility in Mililani which could administer the use of the room; now therefore,</p>

<p>BE IT RESOLVED that the Mililani/Waipio/Melemanu Neighborhood Board No. 25 requests that the Department of Transportation Services explore the possibility of a public/private partnership with the Mililani Town Association (MTA) in administering the long-awaited use of the transit center meeting room by community members and organizations; and</p>

<p>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be transmitted to the Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu, the Department of Transportation Services, Council Chair Nestor Garcia, and the Board of Directors of the MTA.<br />

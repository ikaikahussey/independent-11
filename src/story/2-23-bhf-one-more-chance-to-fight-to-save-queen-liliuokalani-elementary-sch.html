<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Due to the overwhelming response at last week&#8217;s Board of Education (BOE) Committee meeting regarding the closure of Queen Liliuokalani Elementary School, where there was not enough time to hear the verbal testimony of everyone in the crowd, there will be a continuation of the meeting on Thursday, February 24, at 3:00 p.m. in the Queen Liliuokalani Building, Room 404, located at 1319 Miller Street (across from Queenâ€™s Medical Center).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Verbal testimony is limited to three minutes.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.hawaiiboe.net/Connect/Pages/SubmitTestimony.aspx" target="_blank">Alternatively, the public may also submit written testimony to the BOE on-line here</a></b></p>

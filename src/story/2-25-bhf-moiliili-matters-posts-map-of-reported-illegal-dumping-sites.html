<p>MOILIILI&#8212;Illegal dumping has long been a problem on Oahu. The online community forum, Moiliili Matters, has been tackling it head on, providing resources about what to do with bulky items. Their latest effort to combat the problem is posting a map of illegal garbage dumping sites, to help identify the perpetrators.&nbsp; </p>

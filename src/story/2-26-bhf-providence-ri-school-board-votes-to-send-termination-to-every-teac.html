<p><em>The Huffington Post </em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/25/providence-school-board-v_n_828103.html"></a>reported yesterday that the Providence school board voted Thursday to notify every one of its nearly 2,000 teachers that they were subject to being terminated at the end of the school year. </p>

<p>City officials said the action would give them the ability to make budget cuts. Granted, not everyone will actually wind up with out a job, but the vote was shocking nonetheless on a local and national level, and puts our own problems here in Honolulu in context.&nbsp; </p>

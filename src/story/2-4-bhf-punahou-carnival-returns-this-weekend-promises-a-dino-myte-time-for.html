"caption":"The Punahou Carnival tradition began back in 1932, when, during the Depression, Academy students hosted an \"Oahuan Campus Carnival\" to raise money for the yearbook. Held on Rice Field, it took place early one Friday afternoon in April and lasted until late evening, with the usual Carnival fare and games. In the end, they raised $240 for the Oahuan. In 1936, the PTA and the junior class banded together and introduced the first Carnival rides.  <i>Courtesy Photo</i>",

<p>MAKIKI&#8212;Financial aid scholarships. That&#8217;s where all the money you spend on malasadas, chutney, white elephant goods, the variety show, and more each and every year. The proceeds from the Punahou Carnival help support the more than 400 students at Punahou who benefit from its financial aid program.</p>

<p>And guess what? The Punahou Carnival returns big this weekend. Brought to you by the class of 2012, this year&#8217;s festivities features a pre-historic theme. The two-day event will be held on Friday, February 4 and Saturday, February 5 from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.</p>

<p>From rides and games to crafts and food, hosting the Punahou Carnival takes months of preparation prior to opening day on the first Friday in February. Every year, the junior class organizes, plans and executes the theme and activities for the event. Their parents and other volunteers from across the Punahou community also contribute their time to prepare for and staff the many Carnival booths and activities.</p>

<p>WAHIAWA&#8212;Free Micro-enterprise Training will be offered this month thanks to the Wahiawa Community Based Development Organization (Wahiawa CBDO), whose mission is to be responsible for developing and implementing area-wide projects that will provide a strong economic base and improve the quality of life for area residents.</p>

<p>The course equips individuals with information and basic business plans to start their own businesses. Micro-enterprises are generally home-based and require little start-up funds. They are usually owner or family operated. Typical micro-enterprises include cleaning services, landscaping services, crafts, agricultural products, and specialty foods. Applicants must meet federal Department of Housing and Urban Development guidelines for low-to-moderate income. Mentors provided for successful applicants.</p>

<p>An orientation will be held on Tuesday, February 15 at 7:00 p.m. Training will take place Tuesdays and Thursday evenings from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. from February 22 to April 28. Thirty hours of follow-on training will be given in five different agricultural businesses.</p>

<p>Classes will be held in Wahiawa at the facilities of New Life Body of Christ Church, 70 S. Kamehameha Highway.</p>

<p>Applicants must meet income requirements and complete a registration form. Preference will be given to applicants who live in the Wahiawa Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area (NRSA).

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The U.S. Department of Education is awarding $2.5 million in grants that will support the University of Hawaii at Hilo’s Kipuka Native Hawaiian Student Center by establishing a new on-campus living-learning center as well as implementing activities to further support students and help boost the institution’s graduation rate.</p>

<p>The federal funding is made possible through the U.S. Department of Education’s Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions Education Grants Program.</p>

<p>The grant award descriptions are as follows:</p>

<p><br />
<b>$1,969,105 to renovate a campus housing facility to establish the Hale Kanilehua Living-Learning Center</b></p>

It will provide a safe and supportive living-learning environment for students by successfully transitioning them into the University through first-year experience seminars and other academic/social integration experiences.

<p>* Enhancing Hawaiian Language Learning and Teaching&#8212;This activity will enhance Hawaiian Language learning and teaching through development and improvement of course materials, development of new courses and assessment tools, and faculty development and mentoring.</p>

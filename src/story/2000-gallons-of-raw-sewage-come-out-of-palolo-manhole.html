<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Department of Environmental Services responded last night to a sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) in Palolo. The call came in at 6:45 p.m. with the crew arriving at 7:25 p.m. and secured the site at 7:45 p.m.</p>

<p>The Department of Health has been notified. The crew cleaned, disinfected, and deodorized the affected area. Signing and sampling was scheduled for Wednesday morning.</p>

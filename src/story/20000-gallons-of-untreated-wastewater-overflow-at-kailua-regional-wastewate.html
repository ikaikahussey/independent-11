<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Cityâ€™s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) responded this morning to a sanitary sewer overflow at its Kailua Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.</p>

<p>A sewer pipe broke around 7:00 a.m. causing an estimated 20,000 gallons of untreated wastewater into an in-plant storm drain that was contained in an adjacent drainage ditch.&nbsp; The flow to the pipe has resumed while crews were dispatched to do repair work.</p>

<p>ENV notified the state Department of Health. State officials said the affected area has been cleaned, disinfected, and deodorized. Signing has been initiated.</p>

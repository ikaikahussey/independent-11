<p>The 2010 Primary Election voter registration deadline is nearing. <a href="http://hawaii.gov/elections/voters/registration.htm" title="The Affidavit on Application for Voter Registration">The Affidavit on Application for Voter Registration</a> must be received by the City or County Clerk by 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, August 19.</p>

<p>The Office of Elections set Saturday, September 18&#8212;the same day as the State primary elections&#8212;to be the special election day for the offices of Mayor and Prosecuting Attorney as well as the seats for Senate District 7 and 22.</p>

<p>You may vote in the election if you are a citizen of the United States of America, a legal resident of Hawaii, and at least 18 years old. Hawaii laws allow U.S. citizens to pre-register at age 16, but must be 18 by election day to vote.</p>

<p>You are not eligible to register or to vote if you are a convicted and confined felon or you are declared mentally incompetent.</p>

<p>You should re-register if you changed your name, residence address, or mailing address.</p>

<p>If you are (1) registering to vote for the first time in the State of Hawaii; and (2) are mailing in the Affidavit on Application for Voter Registration, federal law (42 U.S.C. § 15483) requires you to provide proof of identification&#8212;a copy of a current and valid photo identification, or a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or government document that shows your name and address. If you do not provide the required proof of identification with the Affidavit on Application for Voter Registration, you will be required to do so at your polling place, or with your voted absentee mail-in ballot.</p>

<p>An Affidavit on Application for Voter Registration is available for download at <a href="http://hawaii.gov/elections/forms/voter_application.pdf" title="http://hawaii.gov/elections/forms/voter_application.pdf">http://hawaii.gov/elections/forms/voter_application.pdf</a>. Voter registration forms are also available at Satellite City Hall, public libraries, U.S. Post Offices, Phone Directory, State services agencies, and  University of Hawaii System offices.</p>

<p>Mail the completed Affidavit on Application for Voter Registration no later than 30 days prior to the election to the appropriate City/County Clerk:</p>

<p>You are not properly registered if you do not receive the NVRAC card; you no longer live at the address listed on the NVRAC card; or your residence address on the NVRAC is the address of a mailing service or a business.</p>

<p>Be sure to have an I.D. with a picture and signature (such as a Hawaii driver’s license or state I.D. card) when you go to vote on election day. The NVRAC card is not an acceptable form of identification.</p>

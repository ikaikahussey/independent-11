<p>Saturday, April 24 will be the Fourth Annual Taste of East Oahu at the Calvary by the Sea. This year&#8217;s event is dedicated to the memory of the late Kahu Doug Olson, who served as pastor for 34 years. Proceeds from the event are divided among three of the church&#8217;s ministries&#8212;and do not go towards church operations. These groups include the &#8220;Angel Network,&#8221; the only food pantry in East Oahu, the youth program, and the Montessori School.&nbsp; All three positively serve and support residents of east Oahu.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>At its conception, Calvary by the Sea felt this event would give back to the community and not be just another fundraiser. It features several restaurants from the Kaimuki area, such as &#8216;Ilima Award Winning 3660 on the Rise and local favorites JJ Bistro &amp; French Pastry and Michels. Other restaurants participating this year include Chai&#8217;s Island Bistro, Hokulani Bake Shop, Maile&#8217;s Thai Bistro, Memoirs Hawaii, Ruth&#8217;s Chris, Wild Mushroom, and Dukes Waikiki/Hula Girl. The ticket price includes unlimited food samplings, wine tastings by HASR, and live entertainment, including Jon Osorio and Steve Brown, Calvary by the Sea&#8217;s own &#8220;Performing Arts of Calvary&#8221; (PAC), Paul Shimomoto and Calvary&#8217;s halau, Na Wahine O Ke Kai Ola. A silent auction will offer work of local artists among other exciting prizes. All of this in the spectacular setting of the Calvary by the Sea lawn makes the event an excellent value.</p>

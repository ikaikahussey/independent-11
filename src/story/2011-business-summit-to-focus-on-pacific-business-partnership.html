<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Pacific Business Partnership Initiative will be the topic of the 2011 Business Summit at the Hawaii Convention Center. The initiative was founded by a group of small business advocates, many of which have a focus on Native Hawaiian business owners.</p>

<p>Discussions began in 2010 with nonprofit business advocates on how to work together, combine forces to assist small firms and increase the economic impact of federal contracting.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“I think that’s because Hawaiian business owners know that Hawaii and the Pacific is home no matter what, no matter what the economy is doing, good or bad,&#8221; said Robin Puanani Danner, President of the nonprofit Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement.&nbsp; “It’s definitely not just a Hawaiian issue&#8212;business growth and sustainability are Pacific issues, it’s something anyone who lives and loves our region faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>“We’ve been convening small business owners every year since 2002,” said Billy Ornellas, Vice President of the Native Hawaiian Economic Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy organization.&nbsp; “It’s  important for business leaders to get around a table to actually talk public policy and unify ourselves around what our priorities are, as Pacific businesses.”</p>

<p>The Pacific Business Partnership Initiative brings multiple advocates and stakeholders together to meet three basic goals:</p>

<p>• Ensure annual business summits to promote mentorship and trainings are held in the Pacific region.<br />
• Connect small and big business to increase business-to-business opportunities between Pacific companies.<br />
• Identify the regional priorities of Pacific small business firms.</p>

<p>The city has sent its real property assessment notices for 2015, and the total assessed valuation of all taxable real property on Oahu has increased from $200.74 billion to $214.90 billion, an overall increase of 7.1 percent. According to the city, &#8220;new developments, including residential subdivisions, condominiums, commercial and industrial projects, the construction of new buildings and improvements to existing parcels, and increases in the values of properties&#8221; all contributed to the overall increase. <br />
 <br />
Residential property gross valuations increased from $162.85 billion to $174.52 billion, or 7.2 percent. Hotel and resort property values increased 16.4 percent, commercial property values increased 4.8 percent, and industrial property values increased 3.9 percent. The 2015 assessed valuations were set as of October 1, 2014, and are based on sales of similar properties that were made through June 30, 2014.<br />
 <br />
The assessment notice is a statement of what the city has determined to be the property’s value for tax assessment purposes. This notice includes property assessment information including any exemption which the owner has been granted in accordance with city ordinance. The standard homeowner’s exemption for an owner-occupied property is $80,000 and increases to $120,000 for homeowners age 65 or older.<br />
 <br />
The net taxable value is one of two components used to calculate real property taxes for next fiscal year of July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The second component is the tax rate. The tax rate will be set by the City Council during June of 2015 as it finalizes the budget for fiscal year 2016. The real property tax bill of an individual property is determined by multiplying the net taxable value by the appropriate tax rate and the application of any tax credits.<br />

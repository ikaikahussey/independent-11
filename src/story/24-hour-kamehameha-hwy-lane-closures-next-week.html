<p>HALEIWA&#8212;One lane of Kamehameha Highway will be closed 24-hours on five consecutive days starting Monday, April 18 through Friday, April 22 due to roadway construction work. A concrete bus pad will be constructed on Kamehameha Highway fronting Kono&#8217;s Breakfast and Lunch at the North Shore Marketplace opposite Kilioe Place.</p>

<p>Kamehameha Highway traffic lanes will be temporarily contra-flowed during the construction.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Motorists are advised to use caution in this area. Police officers will be stationed at both ends of the construction zone to direct traffic. During the closure, motorists are encouraged to avoid the construction area on Kamehameha Highway and use alternative routes such as the Joseph P. Leong Highway.</p>

<p>Bus patrons normally using the Kamehameha Highway bus stop opposite Kilioe Place, which will be closed during construction, are asked to use the temporary bus stop located just north fronting the North Shore Marketplace. </p>

<p>HALEIWA &#8212; One lane on Kamehameha Hwy will be closed 24-hours, five consecutive days starting Monday, May 2, through Friday, May 6, 2011 due to roadway construction work. The project is constructing a concrete bus pad on Kamehameha Highway directly across from the Haleiwa Shopping Plaza and next to Malama Market Haleiwa.</p>

<p>Kamehameha Highway traffic lanes will be temporarily contra-flowed during the construction.&nbsp; Motorists are advised to use caution in this area. Police officers will be at both ends of the construction zone (24 hours) to direct the one lane contra-flow traffic.&nbsp; </p>

<p>During the closure, motorists are encouraged to avoid Kamehameha Highway if possible.&nbsp; Through traffic normally using Kamehameha Highway are encouraged to take alternative routes. The Haleiwa Bypass Road (Joseph P. Leong Highway) is a suggested alternative.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Bus patrons normally using the Kamehameha Hwy bus stop (north-bound) next to the Malama Market Haleiwa are asked to use the bus stop located further north on Kamehameha Highway adjacent to the Ace Hardware store. For more bus information please see <a href="http://www.thebus.org " target="_blank">www.thebus.org </a>or call 848-5555.</p>

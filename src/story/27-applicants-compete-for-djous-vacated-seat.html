<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Honolulu City Council has received 27 applications for the vacant East Honolulu District IV Council seat and will have an opportunity to meet the applicants at a Special Executive Matters and Legal Affairs Committee meeting on Thursday, June 3, at 1:00 p.m. The hope is that the Council will be able to reach a consensus on who will be the interim successor by the end of the meeting, a choice that will be finalized at a June 9 meeting. A full-term successor will be voted in during the 2010 regular elections.</p>

<p> “The Council has requested all applicants to attend Thursday’s meeting,” said Honolulu City Council Chair Todd K. Apo in a news release. “We also have asked each of them to prepare and present information about their community activities and individual positions on various city projects such as roads, sewers, and transit. The Council looks forward to hearing from the candidates and selecting the best representative for the district,” said Apo. </p>

<p>Applicants for the vacancy are as diverse as they are plentiful. They include former and current members of the neighborhood boards within the district, numerous attorneys, a former state research analyst, former state lawmakers, an elected member of the state Board of Education, Djou&#8217;s former chief of staff, a former Honolulu Police Chief, a veterinarian, and various community activists. The only requirement is that the applicants live in District Four, which stretches from Hawaii Kai to Waikiki. Djou, Apo, and other Council members have also expressed a preference that whomever they select for the temporary position promises not to seek the full four-year term in this fall&#8217;s elections because of the advantage that person would have running as an incumbent.</p>

<p>The public will be allowed to attend the meeting at Honolulu Hale and weigh in on the applicants&#8217; qualifications.</p>

<p>January 2011 Statistics – Included 6 structure fires, 3 rubbish, 1 vehicle, 35 medical, 6 miscellaneous, and 1 major incident (Kunia Road-6 companies responded).<br />
Fire Safety Tip – Smoke alarms save lives and are an important part of a home fire escape plan. Properly installed and maintained smoke alarms have contributed to a 50% decrease in fire deaths. According to the National Fire Protection Association, occupants are twice as likely to survive a home fire if there are working smoke alarms. An estimated 890 lives could be saved yearly if homes contained working smoke alarms.<br />
Smoke Alarms and Fire Safety Tips – 1) Install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every level on the home, including the basement 2) Test smoke alarms at least once a month or as directed by the manufacturer. 3) Replace smoke alarm batteries yearly or as directed by the manufacturer. 4) The best smoke alarms are hardwired and interconnected so that if one alarm detects smoke, all alarms in the house are activated. These alarms have backup batteries that must be maintained. 5) Designate a safe meeting place outside the home and practice your family escape plan.</p>

<p>Honolulu Police Department (HPD) – Lt. Eric Brow reported the following:</p>

<p>RESIDENTS’ /COMMUNITY CONCERNS:</p>

<p>Disturbing Email – 1) Board member Yoshimura expressed concern receiving an email criticizing several Board member’s character. Most disturbing was the fact that a copy of this email was brought home by his young daughter. Yoshimura’s name and other board members were mentioned negatively in the email. He noted the Board is there to service the community and members are non-paid volunteers who try their best to make the right decision (s) for the community. He stated that the email is a bad example to our children about service in our community. 2) A resident did not find the email negative. 3) Board member Costales said that everyone has a right to their opinion. However, research should be done before making untrue and inaccurate accusations. Organizations and individuals making these types of accusations have no credibility.</p>

<p>BOARD BUSINESS:</p>

<p>Discussion of Proposed Meheula Vista Senior Affordable Rental Project – Chair reminded everyone about order and decorum, and public testimony is limited to one (1) minute. Ellis requested that speakers should be given two (2) minutes.&nbsp; There were no objection.</p>

<p>Opposition:</p>

<p>It was asked if Castle &amp; Cooke could redraw the sales promotion that Mauka would have an arts center.<br />
Last month 800 residents signed a petition in opposition to this project. The next step would be legal action against Castle &amp; Cooke.<br />
Noise and sirens would be a problem 24/7.<br />
Seniors should stay in an area near their current home.<br />
Both art and senior center are needed. Schools have inadequate in art and music programs due to budgetary cuts.<br />
Board members and public officials were asked to stand with the community in opposition and vote no to the project.<br />
Services to the area are a mile away (grocery shopping, etc.).<br />
The traffic study is flawed; parking issues; seniors would need cars.<br />
Concern about the amount of units on a small lot providing 1/3 parking for tenants.<br />
Limiting applicants who have cars.<br />
Impacts to surrounding area affects the quality of life.<br />
Castle &amp; Cooke promises were not delivered.<br />
Sen. Dela Cruz sent a survey to Mauka residents.<br />
Castle &amp; Cooke’s master plan to the Land Use Commission Planning Committee included infrastructure, schools, affordable housing, etc.. The commercial property was put on the plan. Schools are no overcrowded.<br />
Why did Castle &amp; Cooke not make provisions for senior housing? The resident opposed Castle &amp; Cooke’s deception.<br />
The age limit is too young; age limits are a federal mandate.<br />
Too many high rises.<br />
An arts program would bring out the quality in kids; build something for kids on the site. Prefer that something is built for the kids. When the homes were purchased buyers were told the lot would remain commercial.<br />
 A letter from Citizens Against Residential Expansion (CARE) Mililani circulated asking the Board to oppose the proposed Meheula Vista Senior Affordable Rental Development. If is not possible, they ask that the Board not take a position.</p>

<p>Support:</p>

<p>Noise in the area is minimal, with school traffic during and after school. Seniors want to be independent. The Catholic Charities are not out for a profit.<br />
We need to be fair and respectful to our kupuna. Catholic Charities is a trustworthy and responsible organization. Housing is needed for kupuna and homeless families.<br />
Two (2) Kalakaua Vista residents spoke in support of the project and shared their experiences living in a senior affordable housing.<br />
Not all seniors can afford private senior communities. Mililani should embrace the project and the first to have senior affordable rental housing. There is a waiting list for nursing homes.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns:</p>

<p>There are six (6) senior housing projects that have been approved by the City and State built by GSF LLC.<br />
The average age of tenants is the upper 70’s.<br />
Needs assessments is considered by the City during permitting<br />
The intent is to have the taller buildings along the property tree line.<br />
Due to lack of ridership Bus #51 stops at Kuaoa Street and is inconvenient.<br />
The required percentage of guest parking stalls has been exceeded and is 48% of tenant units.<br />
Depending on the project, minimum age is either 55 or 62.&nbsp; Federal mandated age is 55.<br />
City Council makes the final approval. A Board presentation is required, but a Board vote is not necessary.</p>

<p>Follow up will be done if there is flexibility to change the age. It was reiterated federal mandate age is 55 years.<br />
Staff would use the guest or visitor center parking.<br />
 Off-site parking during peak hours is a major concern.<br />
 Once tenant parking stalls have been assigned, if tenants purchasing a car and parks on the street would be grounds for eviction.<br />
It was requested having the design changed to 2-story buildings. Follow up will be done regarding alternatives as to what changes could be done, liability issues, etc.<br />
It was mentioned the developer should not continue if the community opposes the project.<br />
A ‘No’ Board vote cuts off communication on the development.<br />
Senior facilities provide activities for their residents.<br />
A density concern was raised and asked why build 300 units if not for profit.<br />
.&nbsp; A majority of the community went through the process and now will take legal action.</p>

<p>Yoshimura moved that a letter in support with conditions of the Meheula Vista be sent to the Honolulu City Council, Hawaii Housing Finance Corporation:</p>

<p>Discussion Followed:</p>

<p>Nakasone amended the motion to reduce the number of units, and reducing building to 2-stories; accepted by Yoshimura.<br />
Ellis amended the motion adding tenants addresses not be used for district exceptions; accepted by Yoshimura.<br />
Nakasone noted number of parking stalls should concur with existing law.<br />
Suwa amended the motion adding to the age limit occupancy, and consider raising the age limit to 62; accepted by Yoshimura.<br />
Nakasone commented there are too many units if each tenant is not permitted a parking stall. She suggested the CARE Mililani handout be incorporated in the motion.<br />
Oishi was concerned with parking stalls being limited by the State/City. Traffic from a senior project would not burden the schools<br />
Ellis noted if the developer wants to be a good neighbor a two-story parking structure could be built.<br />
Costales said a good healthy discussion was held this evening.<br />
Suwa suggested conducting density reassessment and re-checking traffic concerns, re-phasing. If and when the development progresses, would the public be allowed input.<br />
Nakasone requested one parking stall per tenant, guest, and employees. She added that Miliani Town Association (MTA) wrote a letter opposing the project.<br />
Chair commented that this developer has experience in building senior projects as evidenced by previous projects that have passed both the Council and HHFDC. These types of project will go through. However, conditions should be set.<br />
Mililani has approximately 13,000 units and building of senior housing is not mandated by the State or City in master plans.</p>

<p>The motion was in support of Meheula Vista with the following conditions reduce the number of units, mandate occupants address not be used for school district exceptions, and consider raising the age limit to 62 was ADOPTED,6-3-0 (AYE: Agader, Costales, Oishi, Suwa, Yoshimura, Hazama; NO: Ellis, Nakasone, Tamashiro).</p>

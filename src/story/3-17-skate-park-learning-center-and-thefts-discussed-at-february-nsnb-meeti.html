Since the late 1970’s, properly installed and maintained smoke alarms have contributed to a 50% decrease in fire deaths. According to the National Fire Protection Association, occupants are twice as likely to survive a home fire if there are working smoke alarms. An estimated 890 lives could be save each year if homes contained working smoke alarms. Follow the following safety tips:</p>

<p>o &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every level of your home, including the basement.<br />
o &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Test smoke alarms at least once a month or as directed by the manufacturer.<br />
o &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Replace smoke alarm batteries once a year or as directed by the manufacturer.<br />
o &nbsp;  &nbsp;   The best smoke alarms are hardwired and interconnected so that if one alarm detects smoke, all alarms in the house are activated. These also have backup batteries that must be maintained.<br />
o &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Designate a safe meeting place outside your home, and practice your family escape plan.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Fireworks: Fireworks permits can be obtained for use of fireworks on New Years Eve, Chinese New Years, Fourth of July, for births, deaths, anniversaries, funerals, weddings, grand openings, blessings, and other cultural uses.</p>

The BFS Director prepares an inventory of such real property and circulates this list to the agencies of the City. If any other City agency indicates a need for the use of any listed real property, the BFS Director may recommend to the Mayor the transfer of the use of the real property to that City agency. If the real property is not recommended for transfer to another City agency, or is not transferred within a reasonable time, the property is then deemed surplus real property. The BFS Director, with the concurrence of the Corporation Counsel, shall determine whether to recommend to the City Council the disposal of the surplus real property.&nbsp; The BFS Director submits a recommendation and draft resolution to the City Council before any surplus real property may be disposed of.&nbsp; The City Council determines whether to adopt the resolution authorizing the BFS Director to dispose of the surplus property in accordance with that resolution or by ordinance.</p>

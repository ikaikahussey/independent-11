<p>NORTH SHORE&#8212;On June 30, 2006, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs became the legal owner of Waimea Valley on Oahu&#8217;s North Shore. The new ownership was a result of months of negotiation after the Honolulu City Council considered a settlement the previous year, amidst community protest, that would have subdivided the valley.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Title transferred to Hiipaka LLC in 2007 as part of an organizational design to facilitate and care for the valley&#8212;providing opportunities for the community to care for Waimea Valley.</p>

<p>Hiipaka LLC also teaches how the 1,800 acre valley offers an &#8220;authentic cultural window into lifestyle and culture of the Hawaiian people&#8221; through programs and activities.</p>

<p>The organization&#8217;s upcoming Waimea Valley Community Day, which takes place on April 16, offers a joint opportunity for volunteers take part in the preservation process.</p>

<p>Community members eight-years-old and up are invited to participate, but children under 18 are asked to be accompanied by an adult. </p>

<p>Volunteers that day will conduct a variety of activities, ranging from planting trees in the North Valley, working in the valley on current collections, and helping to maintain the sacred valley&#8217;s cultural sites. The valley&#8217;s cultural and botanical staff will work with the volunteers throughout the morning to help care for the ahupuaa&#8217;s resources.</p>

<p>The number of participants is limited to 60 volunteers, so those who would like to help are urged to sign up soon to reserve a space.</p>

<p>After meeting at the Visitor Center at 8:45 a.m., the program will run from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Valley representatives ask volunteers to wear closed toe shoes and bring sun screen, water, and a hat.</p>

<p><i>Volunteers should contact Cybil Rawlins at (808) 638-5855 or e-mail at CRawlins@waimeavalley.net to reserve a space.</i></p>

Fire Safety Tip: Smoke alarms save lives and are an important part of a home fire escape plan. Properly installed and maintained smoke alarms have contributed to a 50% decrease in fire deaths. According to the National Fire Protection Association, occupants are twice as likely to survive a home fire if there are working smoke alarms. Do you have working smoke alarms in your home?<br />
Smoke Alarm and Fire Safety Tips – 1) Install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every level of the home, including the basement. 2) Test smoke alarms monthly as directed by the manufacturer. 3) Batteries should be replaced once a year. 4) Hardwired and interconnected are the best smoke alarms so that if one alarm detects smoke, all the house alarms are activated. These alarms have backup batteries that must be maintained. 5) .A safe meeting place outside the home should be designated and the family escape plan should be practiced.</p>

<p>Councilmember Ernie Martin: Mike Sakata circulated the written report and highlighted the following:</p>

<p>Requesting Kokololio Beach Park Kept Open – The Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) are considering a Board’s resolution to keep the gates open.</p>

<p>Hau`ula Beach Park Camping Notification – A) After September 26, 2010 DPR staff was instructed to inform families using the temporary group campsite that permits for use would cease. The group camp site temporary site was allowed to continue due to the volume of requests. B) DPR concluded that usage of the group camp created concerns such as traffic congestion (inadequate parking), safety of campers walking along Kamehameha Highway to the restroom (to avoid walking through the group campsite), and the increased need to pump the septic tank because effluent levels threaten to spill out of the septic tanks. C) The number of campers exceeds the permitted numbers as family members and friends join the campers. D) Relocating this group campsite is not an option because of the continuing loss of park land to erosion. E) Group camping will continue to be allowed as specified in the DPR’s Camping Rules and Regulations.<br />
Clearing of Mouths and Culverts – A) The City was recently informed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) that mechanical stream cleaning previously performed by the City was no longer authorized and may be considered a violation. B) USACE is working on reissuing a general permit which may allow some stream mouth opening operations to be performed; equipment will not be allowed in the stream area. The permit issuance may take three (3) months. C) An individual permit (issuance may take six to nine months) must be obtained for stream mouth openings requiring equipment within the stream area or below the mean high water. D) Emergency stream mouth openings may be allowed to prevent loss of life or substantial property damage; subject to review by the USACE. E) Residents may be allowed to clear the mouths of culverts using manual labor not regulated by the USACE. F) Contact: Thomas Takeuchi of the Division of Road Maintenance at 768-3600.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Cleaning of Stream Entrances – It was asked who to contact regarding mosquito problems, stagnant water, and foul odors at the streams. Sakata said that in most cases City and State try to work together on the problem. Contact the office with specific streams for follow up.</p>

<p>The meeting rules of speaking was read by Treasurer Kalua`u.</p>

<p>Cleaning of Streams and Drains – A) Comment was that it is also the responsibility of the land owner to clean areas near and at his/her property. If the streams and drains are cleaned by the community and the stagnant/dirty water is let out it is a violation of the clean water act. B) The City was assisting with the cleaning at the time of the request. However, it is a health and safety issue for the board to address. A permit is needed for the cleanup.</p>

<p>Mayor Peter Carlisle’s Representative: Bryan Mick reported the following:</p>

<p>State of the City Address – Mayor Peter Carlisle will give the State of the City Address on Thursday, February 24, 2011 at 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Hau`ula Beach Park Camping – Family camping will continue to be permitted for up to 10 people per campsite. To prevent the park’s individual wastewater system from being over taxed, the total number of campers in the park on any given day needs to be reduced. Therefore, the temporary group campsite will no longer be permitted out. Families with more than 10 persons will need to secure the permits for additional campsites as available.<br />
Envision Laie Clarification – The Envision Laie proposal is included in the Public Review Draft (PRD) of the Ko`olauloa sustainable communities Plan in response to the many Laie residents that attended and participated in Envision Laie (EL) meetings and voiced their support. The PRD represents a formal opportunity for the community to comment on this Laie proposal. There will be a final plan version developed after the public comment period. This final version will be sent to the City Planning Commission who will hold its own hearing, submit its recommendations to the City Council, who will make the decision on whether to adopt Envision Laie as part of the plan.<br />
Clarification from Department of Planning &amp; Permitting Director, David Tanoue’s Comment (“He doesn’t consider the merits of any development proposal”) – The initial evaluation of any project is whether or not it complies with applicable laws and regulations.<br />
Request for Land in Area to Store Matson Container with Emergency Supplies – The Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) previously informed Board member that the placement of a Matson container on park property was not acceptable use of the land which was acquired for recreational purposes. The city Department of emergency Management (DEM) does not own any land in the area.<br />
Evacuation Points for the Hau`ula Community – BWS regretfully cannot grant requests to use access roads to any of its facilities as emergency evacuation points. During an emergency it is critical to BWS operations to have continued access to its facilities. Allowing use of BWS access road or facility during an emergency may conflict with facility operations. It was suggested the State Civil Defense be contacted to discuss and coordinate evacuation points for the community.<br />
Petition to Dissolve the Ko`olauloa NeighborhoodBoard – It was asked and explained that a petition with 120 signatures are needed to place the issue on the agenda. However, a letter was sent to 35 people for residential address verification with only seven responding. The Commission is waiting for the 100 signatures with verified addresses.

3.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Group Camping – Follow up will be done if Kokololio Park can accommodate two (2) large camping groups.<br />
4.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Neighborhood Board Elections/Term Extensions – A) Active voters registered with the City Clerk or registered with the NCO (form on website) or military (Hawaii not permanent residence) may vote in the Neighborhood Board elections. B) It was clarified that the Commission has scheduled a special meeting for Thursday, February17, 2011 to decide if Board terms would be extended due to budgetary constraints.

Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, our new City Councilman Ernie Martin, and John Reppun (Director, KEY Project) met with the HCA to discuss how to initiate similar programs in Hau’ula.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <br />
How much money is needed annually to run a community recreational center?<br />
The Answer: It depends on whether you have the use of the facility until 4 or 5 pm or 9pm.&nbsp; If it is open until 9:00 pm then you need full-time people, a lease or deed, a secretary, office equipment and more.&nbsp; In Nanakuli, they needed $250,000 a year.&nbsp; David also recommended that we have different programs at different times for the younger children (under age 7), the preteens and the older teens (ages 13 – 17) or a hybrid of certain days scheduled for different age groups.&nbsp; David discussed the need to have adequate funding needed to hire staff.</p>

<p>What makes a successful community/recreational program such as Boys/Girls Club grow and prosper? David feels that the key to successful programs is always one key person. You have to find the right person to come in and do the work. A facility should be open evenings, weekends, holidays.</p>

<p>An exemplary program (we can have this here) is an audio and visual multimedia center such as Searider Productions Academy in Waianae.&nbsp; Here the kids make their own music and use the computer lab. This is funded through a Community Benefits Grant.&nbsp; The kids love this program.&nbsp; If you want to attract the teens, all you need is equipment costs and to hire one person who knows the technology and who is really good with kids; this person will draw the teens into the program which will be perceived as a cool place to be and friends will bring friends (e.g., small dances and music). You can find people in the community – good welders, mechanics etc. (not necessarily college graduates) but someone who know how to relate to kids.</p>

<p>Another exemplary program is Leaders in Training.&nbsp; A group decides what community projects, excursions etc. are needed and they partner with the Judiciary.&nbsp; They are now an alternative to detention.&nbsp; It costs $4000- $5000 a day to keep a kid in detention.&nbsp; Rather than having kids do menial tasks, these kids work with other human beings. For example, the kids were required to spend one hour at Shriners but they spent 4 hours.&nbsp; Give the kids an opportunity to do something for themselves with a minimum of adult mandates and they will decide for themselves.</p>

<p>How do you draw kids into the program and keep it going?&nbsp; The person whom we hire to work with the kids has to be relentless – nothing is impossible.&nbsp; David went to Waianae and looked for the most ‘kolohe’ kid around to bring into the program.&nbsp; He watched for the natural leaders at schools - not the school leaders – but kids right on the edge of getting in trouble.&nbsp; Then he convinced that one guy to come and the other kids will follow.&nbsp; Convince him that it is better than doing what he’s doing.&nbsp; Burt shared his experience with ROTC and a- risk kids.&nbsp; He found that many of these kids succeed when there is structure and the trust will follow.</p>

<p>Does Hauula have a chance for funding? The question directed at Councilman Ernie Martin is: Do we have a chance? He said that we have a great chance now that he is the budget chair if our requests coincide with what the community envisions for itself.&nbsp; Another question was raised about transportation for young people to get to the programs since this community covers a wide area.&nbsp; Ernie said that if the demand is high and we are justified, funding is more likely.</p>

<p>Funding information: Community Block Grants has program funds but you have to be very specific about how you want to use that – it is not that easy.&nbsp; Boys &amp; Girls Clubs have been fortunate that Ernie and his staff have been very helpful in steering them in the direction where they had the best shot for monies or which road leads to the funding. Then the road gets clearer because Ernie knows what to ask for and where the road leads.&nbsp; The Hauula area has been underserved; Ernie knows where the resources are.</p>

<p>Should Hauula have a fiscal agent who could manage the nonprofit programs?&nbsp; This would help us to start slowly without having a 501c3 (which can be quite costly)?&nbsp; For city funding purposes we need a 501c3 or a fiscal agent.&nbsp; It depends on the relationship, there are advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; Right now we are considering working under the fiscal umbrella of Key Project.&nbsp; John Reppun will bring this up to the Board of Directors to seek their approval.&nbsp; John gave the analogy of 501c3 being like a screwdriver – if you have one – use it. He shared that KEY Project bylaws state that its mission is for programs from Kaneohe to Kahuku and believes that the challenge is passing the torch to the next generation.&nbsp; KEY board members are very familiar with Ko’olauloa and have talked about the need for a long time. </p>

<p>A suggested starting point can be to work with young kids’ 6th – 8th graders and bring programs into a building that already exists and then move into the teen program.&nbsp; Another possible fiscal agent can be the Hawaii Community Youth Assoc. – use Boys &amp; Girls Clubs for technical assistance &amp; trainings, etc. – we don’t have to be under a Boys and Girls Club umbrella – the whole mission is to keep the kids off the streets.</p>

<p>How can we have a Hauula Recreational Facility/Community Center? Some of the most under-utilized facilities are the city and county buildings, including the one in Hauula, the Hauula Civic Center. The Hauula Civic Center could possibly be used (or partially used) for a recreational center for kids and community. The challenge is to first work in Hauula to create a strategic plan.&nbsp; We can then work with the City Council to access the Civic Center.</p>

<p>How do we get started? David believes that we are in a good place because we have an interested councilman, Ernie Martin.&nbsp; He suggested four starting points of action. He suggests that if we are serious about this, (1) we need to come up with a plan so that when Ernie presents this, it will be clear what we are going to do, why we want to do it, when, who, how, etc. (2) We also have to have an idea of who is the ‘pied piper’ of the youth program.&nbsp; Bring the person to the meetings – catch him/her on fire – identify who can be the ‘champion.&nbsp; Then (3) go to the Board of Key Project, do a presentation, and work out an MOA related to our strategic plan (4) Then talk to Ernie about where we can get grants.&nbsp; Build the renovation and staffing needs (including number of hours of operation) into the request. We also need to know how we will pay for the overhead costs that are not covered in the grant.&nbsp; Part of the MOA with the fiscal agent will involve a negotiation of their fees for managing our money.</p>

<p>The fiscal agent will give you the financial reports; bookkeeping and reporting will come from them.&nbsp; John shared that KEY has had lots of fiscal turnover and that our involvement may help them to be more accountable. David offered to help us to get private funds – which will also help us to more easily get city funding as it will be easier to sell our program to the funders.&nbsp; David offered to come out to help for no charge and will share some templates that have worked for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs. We need to pull together a passionate group and create a strategic plan and then we will know what we want to sell.&nbsp; Ernie, David and John are encouraging us to pursue this and have offered support.&nbsp; We need to start our planning process to ensure great services and a recreational facility for our kids and families. The main mission is to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble.</p>

<p>Feb. 12 – Hau’ula Hui Non-Profit Workshop, 9:30 AM – 1:30 PM; Purpose: To Develop a Mission and Vision Statement; Consultant- Lehua Lopez, Call Dotty to sign up 255-6944<br />

2.Hauula School Report by Sam Izumi, Principal - Sam Izumi reported on various activities and programs at Hauula School including:&nbsp; rewards &amp; incentives to increase student attendance; geographic exemptions to increase student body; recycling program; efforts to’ go greener’/solar power; library needs; use of an electric sign; parent-teacher conferences; movement towards Annual Yearly Progress (AYP); Kindergarten registration; and Aloha Ko’olauloa fundraiser with Hawaiian food and entertainment on Apr 16.</p>

<p>3. New Free Public Charter School in Hauula. Glen Blomgren gave an update and overview of the new charter school, Hawaii Active Learning Academy – ALA. Their office has opened at Rainbow Castle in Hauula. They are taking registrations at the site at Rainbow Castle or online at (http://www.hawaiiala.com/index.html). The school doesn’t have a charter yet but it will hopefully be approved in late March.&nbsp; Glen feels that many goals that we have related to a community center are parallel with the charter school.&nbsp; He wants to share staff and resources and be part of the community. The goal is to reach 250 students and to start with K-10 and move to K-12. The program will include Eclasses (online) and in-classroom with an emphasis on projects, science, family-involvement, art, music, drama, labs, debate and other areas to offer a wide choice of programs.&nbsp; The intent is to serve the students in Ko’olauloa area but it is open to all statewide. Every child will be given a computer</p>

<p>4. Hau’ula Emergency Leadership Preparedness (HELP) Team Update- Burt Greene: The Red Cross provided training for two days – 22 people attended, most from Hauula. All who completed the course are certified.&nbsp; We now have people here qualified to serve as shelter operation personnel.&nbsp; The Red Cross is pleased because there are very few people who are trained in our area.&nbsp; There will be additional trainings offered in the future. We have no fixed building yet for an evacuation center.&nbsp; When our new park at Hanaimoa is completed we hope to hope to locate an evacuation center there but this will take time. HELP obtained a 20 foot trailer which is up on a property on Hauula Homestead Road. The next step is to survey the community to see what the needs are. THE HELP committee is working with faith-based organizations, such as Mt. Zion Church and Pastor Welch, who have resources and leadership. Van Auna, Head of Security at BYU emphasized that we All should have a 72 emergency kit. He also offered support HELP efforts. </p>

<p>Hauula has two emergency sirens out of function and it is not known when it will be repaired.&nbsp; Burt emailed Jessica Wooley and Ed Texeira (Civil Defense) about this problem. We have been told that funds are not available. Sen. Clayton Hee said that there was $2.2 million for siren repair but we don’t know why this money hasn’t been utilized. Zeni Iese stressed that this problem must be solved before a disaster hits and lives are lost such as in Am. Samoa.&nbsp; Hauula has a high probability of having a tsunami and should have a high priority for siren repair/replacement.&nbsp; Everyone is encouraged to keep gas in their cars. Burt found out that the state is also preparing signs to be place along highway that say to go to high ground.</p>

<p>5. Hau’ula Ahupua’a Hui (HAH) – Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Design Team, Update, Maureen Malanaphy.&nbsp; Maureen and Dotty attended a workshop with Hawaii Stewardship Network in January.&nbsp; We are part of the Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Design Team.&nbsp; Maureen, Dotty and Umi Jensen have been working with the Hawaii Stewardship Network and attending workshops and conferences. This organization can be a great support for us as we plan our Hauula programs and network with other non-profit organizations throughout the state.</p>

<p>6. Hau’ula Monk Seal Recovery &amp; Protection Team - Maureen Malanaphy: Maureen, Dotty and Candy Greene participated in a volunteer training with the Hawaii Monk Seal Response Team Oahu (HMSRTO) in January in Haleiwa and are organizing a Hauula Monk Seal Response Team.&nbsp; Dotty will try to organize another workshop in Hauula with the Monk Seal organization in March.&nbsp; This volunteer group organizes ‘haul outs’ to protect monk seals when they surface on a beach and provides educational presentations and trainings.&nbsp; Glen expressed an interest in having charter students involved. </p>

<p>7. Neighborhood Board Commission Concerns.&nbsp; Barbara Kahana went to a meeting of the Neighborhood Board Commission and shared concerns about significant changes to the neighborhood plan. One major concern is the attitude of the commission about getting input from neighborhood boards.&nbsp; They believe that they have been working for eight months and did their job in asking for feedback. The feedback requested was on the plan to allow the commission to extend the officer’s terms by two-years.&nbsp; How can you extend a member’s term by two years if the member is not actually elected? The commission response is that there is a lack of funding for elections; however, monies are already budgeted for this.</p>

<p>These proposed changes have not been on the Ko’olauloa Neighborhood Board agenda.&nbsp; The Commission stated that they informed board chairs to give NB opportunities to review it and then to provide input to the commission but that there was no feedback so they voted in all of those changes.&nbsp; Apparently they have the power to do it now (whether they do it or not); it is in the plan.&nbsp; It was also noted that anyone can sign up to get the agenda of the Neighborhood Board Commission meetings so that we can be better informed. Items such as this should have been on Ko’olauloa NB agenda.&nbsp; This should be brought up to other Board members. We can complain to the Mayor or though the Commission website. Barbara requests that this be an agenda item for the next Koolauloa Neighborhood and she will send out a summary of the plan.</p>

<p>8. Petition to Dissolve Ko’olauloa Neighborhood Board.&nbsp; Signatures of 100 registered voters are needed– they have now verified ninety eight signatures.&nbsp; The commission is verifying the list of signatures. The problem is that some people put their PO Box numbers on the petition. It is best to put your actual street address. Certified letters were sent to people who put in PO Boxes.&nbsp; People can still send in their petitions directly. You must be a registered voter and live in Koolauloa to sign petition. If you want to sign the petition call Dotty at 255-6944.</p>

<p>9.&nbsp; Cancellation of Jan.2011 Ko’olauloa Neighborhood Board Meeting Concerns was raised at the HCA meeting about the cancellation of the January meeting. There was such short notice that some Board members, many community members and presenters from Windward College were all waiting at the door at the Civic Center. It seems that only selective people were informed about the meeting being cancelled. </p>

<p>10. Ko’olauloa Health and Wellness Center will get a substance abuse treatment grant soon in collaboration the non-profit, Ola Kuo’, founded by Shon Kaanaana/Joe Pouha  </p>

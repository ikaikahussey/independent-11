<p>MANOA&#8212;The University of Hawaii at Manoa today began notifying about 53,000 people listed in a system database that a recent security breach may have exposed personal information, including over 40,000 Social Security numbers and 200 credit card numbers.</p>

<p>The information was housed on a computer server used by the campus&#8217; parking office. The breach occurred on May 30 and was discovered on June 15. The system was immediately isolated, and an investigation was launched to determine scope of the breach and identify individuals who may have been affected. </p>

<p>Letters were mailed to affected individuals on Saturday, July 3; recipients should begin receiving those letters on the next business day, Tuesday, July 6. In addition, an email notice will be sent to affected individuals at their most recent email address on record.</p>

<p>The FBI and Honolulu Police Department have been notified, and a forensic investigation has been initiated.&nbsp;  &nbsp; </p>

<p>To protect personal information from further unauthorized access, Social Security numbers are no longer used for parking transactions, and are being purged from all current and historic parking office databases. Additional security measures that are being taken include strengthening internal automated network monitoring practices, and performing extensive evaluations of systems to identify other potential security risks.</p>

<p>The database contained personal information, including names, Social Security numbers, addresses, driver’s license numbers, vehicle information, and credit card information of two main groups of individuals: UH Manoa faculty and staff members employed in 1998 or anyone who had business with the UH Manoa Parking Office between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2009. </p>

<p>The possibility exists that addresses will not be located for all affected individuals&#8212;predominantly visitors to the campus who either appealed parking citations or who had vehicles towed at UH Manoa between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2009. </p>

<p>BANGKOK, Thailand&#8212;Wild battles and torched malls now light up Bangkok, currently suffering one of its most unruly chapters ever.</p>

<p>After occupying sectors of Bangkok for 10 weeks, protesters demanding the ruling party&#8217;s downfall finally dispersed when soldiers overran their encampment. But while most protesters from the so-called &#8220;Red Shirts&#8221; faction have returned home, a faceless band of hardliners has remained to wage an arson campaign.</p>

<p>As Thailand slips further into chaos, and the struggle&#8217;s death toll ticks towards 70, here are the five things you need to know about the current crisis:</p>

<p><b>1) Who are the Red Shirts?</b><br />
A self-proclaimed faction of &#8220;commoners&#8221; embittered that their favored political parties have been dissolved for fraud. Though comprised largely of working-class Thais, they are loyal to a billionaire: cop-turned-telecom mogul Thaksin Shinawatra, who reigned as premier before the military ousted him in a 2006 coup.</p>

<p>Their main stated goal has been new elections, an outcome many leading media outlets and academics have suggested is the best way forward. But they also seek to end the &#8220;rule of the elites,&#8221; a call to action interpreted peacefully by some and violently by others.<br />
The Red Shirts, calling themselves &#8220;Asia&#8217;s largest democracy movement,&#8221; have embraced the rhetoric of peaceful disobedience. But they have also threatened bloody reprisals; one hardline leader prophetically warned Bangkok would become a &#8220;sea of fire&#8221; if the government would not yield.</p>

<p><b>2) Who&#8217;s burning down Bangkok?</b><br />
A masked mob detached from any visible leadership. But recent military crackdowns against anti-government protesters, including assault rifle strikes that have killed dozens, are clearly their inspiration.</p>

<p>The movement&#8217;s &#8220;fight to the death&#8221; speechmaking, and failure to contain its militant streak, appears responsible for the current mayhem waged in its name. As fires consumed parts of the Thai capital, a radical splinter group known as &#8220;Red Siam&#8221; sent an email to reporters claiming that &#8220;any attempt of &#8216;democratic reform&#8217; has now ended. From today, we begin the journey of democratic revolution of Thailand until we achieve one.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>3) Is this civil war?</b><br />
Not yet. But both protesters and the government have claimed excesses from the other side&#8212;killing protesters with sniper rifles; killing soldiers with grenade launchers&#8212;are pushing Thailand in that direction.</p>

<p>These grim forewarnings of civil war misleadingly conjure images of Rwandan genocide or the North vs. South separatism of the American Civil War. But many foresee this &#8220;civil war&#8221; scenario playing out more like the Basque separatist movement in Spain: an underground movement of sporadic bombings and other attacks that destabilize but don&#8217;t destroy the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;They could go underground, basing themselves in the provinces,&#8221; said Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, an activist sympathetic to the Red Shirts who decries the current shift towards militancy. &#8220;When you can&#8217;t fight openly, you become unseen.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>4) Why does America care?</b><br />
Thailand and the U.S. are old Vietnam War buddies, bonded decades ago by a common fear of communism&#8217;s Southeast Asian spread. Thailand is also America&#8217;s oldest Asian treaty ally, a major exporter to the U.S. and a tourist destination for more than 660,000 Americans each year.</p>

<p>But as China&#8217;s influence rises, particularly in Southeast Asia, Thailand is strategically important as a counterweight to Chinese influence. Each year, the U.S. and Thailand stage the world&#8217;s largest war games on Thai soil&#8212;a projection of American strength in China&#8217;s backyard. A stable, America-friendly Thailand is a big priority for the State Department.</p>

<p><b>5) Is Thailand still safe for tourists?</b><br />
More so than it appears. Its beaches are still among the world&#8217;s most beautiful and its jungles are still lush and enchanting. These tourist draws are accessible without coming anywhere near Bangkok&#8217;s conflicts, largely contained to a 2.5-square mile area. Most incoming flights land in Suvarnabhumi Airport, located in Greater Bangkok, and connection flights to peaceful tourist cities have been unaffected.</p>

<p>And though the images from Bangkok appear hellish, few bystanders and work-a-day Thais have been injured. Even in conflict zones, foreigners are not singled out for violence. Quite the opposite: protesters have been desperate for international approval and the government has fretted over a plunge in tourist arrivals.</p>

<p>The crisis has affected most in Bangkok through inconvenience. The city&#8217;s commuter trains have shut down, its office towers have been temporarily shuttered and several of its nightlife districts have gone quiet.</p>

<p>According to recent statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median earnings for U.S. women working full time, year-round were just 77 percent of U.S. men’s median earnings—a gap of 23 percent. </p>

<p>Median earnings for men in Hawaii were $45,748 compared to women’s median earnings of $38,040 — an earnings ratio of 83 percent.</p>

<p>The pay gap begins early in women’s careers. According to <a href="http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/graduating-to-a-pay-gap-the-earnings-of-women-and-men-one-year-after-college-graduation.pdf">Graduating to a Pay Gap (PDF)</a>, a new report from the <a href="http://www.aauw.org">American Association of University Women</a>, women just one year out of college and working full time were paid on average 82 percent of what their male counterparts were paid. After controlling for hours worked, occupation, college major, employment sector, and other factors associated with pay, the gap shrinks but does not disappear. About one-third of the gap cannot be explained by these factors commonly understood to affect earnings.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Gov. Linda Lingle has released $500,000 for the construction of a photovoltaic system at Lanikai Elementary Public Charter School in Kailua. The project includes the installation of photovoltaic panels on the existing cafeteria roof, along with the installation of a converter to provide a complete renewable energy system. </p>

<p>The installation of the photovoltaic system is expected to reduce the school’s electricity cost by approximately $45,000 per year. </p>

<p>Work on the project is scheduled to begin immediately and is expected to be completed by the spring of 2011.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“Lanikai takes its impact on the environment very seriously,” said Louis Saint-Cyr, Lanikai School Board Chair. “This initiative will provide our children with a hands-on opportunity to discover the benefits of green energy.”</p>

<p>Lanikai was recognized in September of 1996 as one of the State’s first two conversion charter schools under Hawaii’s first charter school law. Since then, Lanikai has continued to excel as a charter school and in 2010 received accreditation. The school currently enrolls more than 330 students in grades K-6.</p>

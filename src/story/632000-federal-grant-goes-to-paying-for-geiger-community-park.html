<p>EWA&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu is receiving a $632,000 federal grant to help pay for recent improvements at Geiger Community Park in Ewa.</p>

<p>The park improvements include two ball fields with dugouts and fencing, two basketball courts, one tennis court, one volleyball court, concrete walkways and curbs, a drinking fountain, irrigation and landscaping, and various electrical upgrades. The work was completed in early 2009, at a total cost of $1.3 million.</p>

<p>The grant is a reimbursement from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, provided by the U.S. Department of the Interior through the National Park Service, and administered by the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.</p>

<p>Honolulu has received 29 Land and Water Conservation Fund grants since the late 1960s. Last year, the City received a $725,000 grant for the Aquatic Center at Central Oahu Regional Park.</p>

<p>The Land and Water Conservation Fund program provides matching grants to states and local governments for the acquisition and development of public outdoor recreation areas and facilities.</p>

<p>The program is intended to create and maintain a nationwide legacy of high quality recreation areas and facilities and to stimulate non-federal investments in the protection and maintenance of recreation resources across the United States.</p>

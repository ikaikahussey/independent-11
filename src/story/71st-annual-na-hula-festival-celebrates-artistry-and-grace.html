<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Parks and Recreation presents the 71st annual Na Hula Festival on Sunday, August 7 at the Queen Kapiolani Park Bandstand from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. </p>

<p>The Na Hula Festival has celebrated the artistry and grace of the hula, Hawaii’s premiere dance form, since 1941. The festival is Hawaii’s longest running annual non-competitive hula event and was created to provide a venue for the kumu hula (hula instructors) of the Department of Parks and Recreation to hoike (showcase) their haumana (students). Currently, some of the kumu who participate in the hula festival teach in the parks, and others are from the community.</p>

<p>The free event will feature Puanani Alama and Leilani Alama Hula Studios. </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A Tsunami Warning remains in effect for the entire State.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-11/hawaii-hit-by-1-meter-tsunami-spurring-coastal-evacuations-closing-ports.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that Hawaii was hit by a 1-meter (39-inch) wave, according to scientists at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which was anticipating scattered damage, not major destruction.</p>

<p>Thursday night, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami watch for the entire state of Hawaii, following an 8.9 magnitude earthquake off of Honshu, Japan.</p>

<p>The earthquake occurred tonight, at 7:46 p.m. HST.</p>

<p>The earliest wave arrived in the islands at approximately 3:27 a.m., Friday morning&#8212;20 minutes later than expected.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/us/12california.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></i> reported that waves started hitting the Hawaiian islands early Friday, but did not cause any major damage. Because there is a tsunami risk for many hours after a large earthquake, residents remain on alert. </p>

<p>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that a tsunami has been generated that could cause damage along coastlines of all islands in Hawaii. Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property.</p>

<p>A tsunami is a series of long ocean waves. Each individual wave crest can last five to 15 minutes or more and extensively flood coastal areas. The danger can continue for many hours after the initial wave as subsequent wave arrive. Tsunami heights cannot be predicted and the first wave may not be the largest. </p>

<p>Tsunami waves efficiently wrap around islands. All shores are at risk no matter which direction they face. The trough of a tsunami wave may temporarily expose the sea floor but the area will quickly flood again. Extremely strong and unusual nearshore currents can accompany a tsunami. Debris picked up and carried by a tsunami amplifies its destructive power. Simultaneous high tides or high surf can significantly increase the tsunami hazard.</p>

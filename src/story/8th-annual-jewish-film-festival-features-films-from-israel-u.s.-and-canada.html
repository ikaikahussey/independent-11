<p><b>WHAT:</b> The Eighth Annual Temple Emanu-El Kirk Cashmere Jewish Film Festival<br />
<b>WHEN:</b> March 6 to 18<br />
<b>WHERE:</b> Doris Duke Theatre<br />
<b>INFO:</b> 532-8700, www.honoluluacademy.org (publishable)<br />

<p>Filmmaker Lynn Roth will be at opening night of the 8th Annual Temple Emanu-El Kirk Cashmere Jewish Film Festival to introduce her film <i>The Little Traitor</i>, starring Alfred Molina. The film won the 2008 Audience Award for best feature film at the Los Angeles Jewish Film Festival. Roth will also lead a discussion following the film.</p>

<p>Presented by Temple Emanu-El and the Honolulu Academy of Arts, the festival is the largest since its 2002 debut, with six feature films and one short film&#8212;all of them Hawaii premieres. The lineup includes two works with a Japanese connection&#8212;<i>Inside Hana&#8217;s Suitcase</i>, which follows a Tokyo teacher and her class as they unravel a Holocaust victim&#8217;s life from the few clues left in her suitcase, and <i>A Matter of Size</i>, about Israeli sumo wrestlers. The festival gets an injection of humor from Catholic-turned-Jewish comedian Yisrael Campbell&#8217;s <i>Circumcise Me</i> and the romantic comedy <i>Beau Jest</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;The festival features a wide variety of films coming from different angles&#8212;and different countries,&#8221; says Film Curator Gina Caruso. &#8220;One highlight is The Lemon Tree, which addresses a really important conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There is courage on the part of Temple Emanu-El to include it in the festival with Rabbi Peter Schaktman leading a discussion after the film.&#8221;</p>

<p>There will be pre-film receptions on March 6, in honor of Lynn Roth (with pupus from Da Spot and beer and wine for purchase) and 13 (with food from Da Spot for purchase).</p>

<p>Temple Emanu-El created the Jewish Film Festival in honor of the late civil rights attorney Kirk Cashmere, who was also interested in sharing Jewish culture with the people of Hawaii. In 2010, Temple Emanu-El, Hawaii&#8217;s oldest Jewish synagogue, celebrates its &#8220;50 Years on the Pali&#8221; anniversary.</p>

Documentary and narrative techniques mix to tell the true story of Holocaust victim Hana Brady. The film retraces a series of coincidences that lead Tokyo school teacher Fumiko Ishioka to a suitcase that belonged to the Czech Jewish girl.

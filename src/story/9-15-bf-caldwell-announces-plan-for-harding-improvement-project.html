<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell has announced plans for a 2.6 million project to improve traffic along Harding Avenue. Funds for the project will come from the approximate $19 million received by the City through the U.S. Economic Recovery Act.</p>

<p>The project includes widening portions of Harding Avenue at the two freeway access points: 11th and 5th Avenues. Drivers will now have a dedicated left-turn lane.</p>

<p>In addition to adding a left-turn lane on 11th and Harding, the City will add another left-turn lane at the same intersection for drivers turning left heading in the mauka direction.</p>

<p>Construction is expected to start this September and will take approximately 11 months to complete. Road work will be scheduled during the off-peak hours.</p>

<p>MAKAKILO&#8212;Mike Golojuch and campaign volunteers spent a majority of this past Saturday morning, September 11, clearing out two discovered dumpsites. Initially, volunteers had the intention of cleaning up a section of the H-1 between Makakilo and Kunia, however during Golojuch’s District 19 Senate campaign community service project they found two illegal dumping sites along the H-1 between Kualakai Parkway and Makakilo.</p>

<p>The first dumping site was on the makai side of the H-1 halfway between the Makakilo on-ramp and the Kualakai Parkway off-ramp. </p>

<p>The second was found at the Waianae bound H-1 on-ramp from Kualakai Parkway. Both sites were filled with used tires, broken surfboards, empty paint cans, furniture, sheets of Plexiglas, and other commercial items.</p>

<p>“This should disturb anyone, area resident or not,&#8221; Golojuch said in a statement. &#8220;They were right off the H-1 and the mauka dump site appeared to have been there for quite some time. While the makai side dumpsite seemed rather new.&#8221;<br />

<p>DOWNTOWN&#8212;Tonight, September 18, Niu Valley resident Kamea Hadar is having an opening at Manifest, 32 N Hotel St., from 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m., during which he will be debuting his new painting, <i>Bloodline</i>. Also included in the show are several portraits, such as <i>Mahia</i> (pictured) and a portrait of Uncle Ernie with one of his prized fighting birds.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Kamea, who is originally from Israel, incorporates diverse themes from his international upbringing into his original works of art. In addition to his paintings, Kamea has enjoyed success in various media such as textile designs and glass etchings, and even created the artwork for Zippy&#8217;s uniforms.</p>

<p>Manifest is located on Hotel Street in Chinatown, directly across from Bar 35. Come and actually enjoy art in Chinatown&#8212;First Friday is always a blast, but we all know that it has very little to do with art anymore. And come early for less crowd and more pupus. </p>

<p><i>For more information, contact kameagallery@gmail.com or call (808) 373-5186. More examples of Kamea&#8217;s work can be found at <a href="kameagallery.com" title="kameagallery.com">kameagallery.com</a>.</i></p>

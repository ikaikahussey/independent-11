<p>HONOLULU&#8212;One night. One meal. Thousands of lives. Lanakila Pacific and honorary event chair Chef Alan Wong extend a friendly reminder that the public has until Thursday, September 23 to purchase a one-of-a-kind dining experience that supports a good cause. Everyone&#8217;s invited to take part in <i>The Good Table,</i> a benefit for <a href="http://www.lanakilapacific.org/more-than-a-meal.asp" title="Lanakila Meals on Wheels">Lanakila Meals on Wheels</a>, Hawaii’s largest and only island-wide meal provider to homebound kupuna. </p>

<p><i>The Good Table</i> is a unique synchronized dining event happening on Thursday, October 7 at 6:00 p.m. across dozens of Oahu’s most popular restaurants. Select restaurants, ranging from casual eateries to the island’s most recognizable fine dining establishments, will serve a special, chef-designed feast for pre-purchased tables in their restaurants. </p>

<p>Proceeds from the purchased tables directly support Meals on Wheels. The non-profit volunteer program serves more than 250,000 meals for seniors in need each year. The average meal recipient is a woman of Asian or Pacific Island decent, 83 years old with an income of less than $1,000 per month.</p>

<p>According to Meals on Wheels, one out of every four people in Hawaii will be 60 years and older by the year 2020. Only 46 percent of Hawaii&#8217;s seniors get out of their home at least once a week. Nearly one in three Hawaii residents over the age of 60 are trying to make ends meet on an annual income that is below $10,000. Seniors living in rural areas are more socially isolated, so are more impacted by hunger issues because of a limited amount of grocery stores or take-out counters within walking distance in their districts. </p>

<p>Delivering more than a nutritious meal, Meals on Wheels volunteers may be a senior’s only personal contact each day. Volunteers also provide nutrition education and counseling, monitor health and welfare, and serve as an important bridge to support services, helping seniors remain in their own homes rather than more costly premature institutionalization.</p>

<p>A full continuum of care is provided including home delivery and kupuna wellness services at 20 locations island-wide, helping seniors remain active and healthy to prolong the need for higher levels of care.</p>

<p>“We say a warm mahalo to the people of Hawaii for the response we’ve received so far,” said Toni Fegers, director of Lanakila Meals on Wheels. “We’d like to encourage everyone who wishes to support our kupuna to purchase a table before the sales deadline. The Good Table truly turns one great meal into many for Hawaii’s elderly in need.”</p>

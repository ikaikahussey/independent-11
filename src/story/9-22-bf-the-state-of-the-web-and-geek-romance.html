<p>MANOA&#8212;The University of Hawaii Outreach College&#8217;s Pacific New Media is presenting two superstars in the tech world, Greg Rewis and Stephanie Sullivan Rewis, for a free public lecture entitled, &#8220;Update: The State of the Web&#8221; on Thursday, September 30. The tech teachers will also host two workshops: &#8220;Web Workflow with CS5&#8221; (with Greg) on Friday, October 1 and &#8220;Building a Better Web with HTML5 and CSS3&#8221; on Saturday and Sunday, October 2 and 3 (with Stephanie). </p>

<p>Greg is Adobe&#8217;s Principal Evangelist for Web Tools and spends over 220 days a year on the road talking with customers, giving product demonstrations at trade shows and seminars, speaking at industry conferences, and leading specialized advanced training sessions featuring Adobe&#8217;s Web Tools product line. Stephanie, founder and principal of W3Conversions, has been a web professional since 1999. A sought-after speaker, tech editor, corporate trainer, author, and coding guru, she&#8217;s called on to solve especially perplexing problems for high-profile websites. Together, Greg and Stephanie co-wrote <i>Mastering CSS with Dreamweaver CS4</i> to help people effectively create websites, using today&#8217;s technology and best practices, with the leading website creation tool. </p>

<p>Beyond their professional relationship, Greg and Stephanie share an unusual partnership: Back in 2008, <i>Wired</i> ran a story about them:<a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/true-story-of-a/" title=" &quot;True Story of a Twitter Marriage Proposal.&quot;"> &#8220;True Story of a Twitter Marriage Proposal.&#8221;</a> Yep, he proposed to her in a tweet. Then in April of 2010, <i>Wired</i> followed up with their wedding, which was live-tweeted: <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/04/twitter-wedding/" title="&quot;So Tweet: Geek Couple Plans Twitter Wedding.&quot;">&#8220;So Tweet: Geek Couple Plans Twitter Wedding.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Juicy Couture will open its first outlet store in Hawaii at the Waikele Premium Outlets in mid-November, <a href="http://pacific.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2010/09/13/daily43.html" title="Pacific Business News reported">Pacific Business News reported</a>. The Los Angeles-based retailer has two boutiques in Hawaii. The first opened at Ala Moana Shopping Center in 2006, followed by a smaller boutique at Royal Hawaiian Center in Waikiki.</p>

<p>Juicy Couture is best known for its cult following of velour track suits and poshing up women and children of all ages (and pets and Paris Hilton, too). The store will occupy the 3,300-square-foot space vacated by Anne Klein just last month. There&#8217;s no word on how many employees will staff the Waikele location, which is expected to open before Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. </p>

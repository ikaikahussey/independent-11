<p>MAKIKI&#8212;The Contemporary Museum (TCM) is presents its <b>Ninth Biennial of Hawaii Artists</b>, one of TCM&#8217;s most popular exhibitions, this Friday, September 24.</p>

<p>The invitational Biennial, inaugurated in 1993, was developed to serve as a complement to Hawaii&#8217;s numerous juried exhibitions, offering artists the opportunity to exhibit a new body of work or installation in one of TCM&#8217;s galleries.</p>

<p>The Biennial exhibitions and catalogues provide an ongoing survey of the remarkable range of contemporary art being created in Hawaii today.</p>

<p>Seven artists were selected to participate in the Biennial: Kloe Kang, Abigail Romanchak, Rosa Silver, Jason Teraoka, Marc Thomas, Maika&#8217;i Tubbs, and Scott Yoell.</p>

<p>This Saturday, September 25 at 11:00 a.m., library goers and local literature fans will be able to meet author Juliet S. Kono at the Kapolei Public Library. Kono, a University of Hawaii and Hilo High alum, will read selections from her latest book <i><a href="http://www.bambooridge.com/storeitem.aspx?pid=75" title="Anshu: Dark Sorrow">Anshu: Dark Sorrow</a></i> and share some of her experiences while writing the novel. </p>

<p>Based on historical events, <i>Anshu</i> is a tale of passion and human triumph as a local Hilo girl is in Japan during the war. The young heroine of the story finds herself adapting in unexpected ways just to survive. Spanning the cane fields of Hawaii and the devastation in Hiroshima, a pregnant and unmarried Himiko Aoki finds her Hawaii-Japanese American identity clashing with Japanâ€™s cultural norms when she is sent to live with relatives in Tokyo in 1941 and becomes trapped there at the outbreak of war. </p>

<p>The one-hour program will include a question-and-answer session and is suitable for ages 12 and older. </p>

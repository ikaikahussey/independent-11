<p>Kanu Hawaii is challenging its members to eat all locally-grown food for the week of September 26 to October 2. Visit <a href="http://www.kanuhawaii.org/" title="http://www.kanuhawaii.org/">http://www.kanuhawaii.org/</a> to register and learn about a host of discounts and specials at restaurants and markets across the state to get you started.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Worried you can’t go 100 percent local? The point is to try to get as close as possible&#8212;commit to the challenge and share what you learn by posting something in the campaign journal.</p>

<p>Also planned is a Food Sustainability in Hawaii Panel with Ed Teixeira, Claire Sullivan, Charlie Reppun, and Matthew Loke. Moderated by Beth-Ann Kozlovich, the panel speaks this Wednesday, September 29. </p>

<p><i>For more information on the challenge and the panel, visit <a href="http://www.kanuhawaii.org/" title="http://www.kanuhawaii.org/">http://www.kanuhawaii.org/</a>.</i></p>

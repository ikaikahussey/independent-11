<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On Monday, Gov. Neil Abercrombie released $67 million from Hawaii&#8217;s Hurricane Relief Fund to restore 17 instructional days for the 2010-2011 school year; and $23.7 million from the Rainy Day Fund for community programs as appropriated by the State Legislature under <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=2469" title="Act 191">Act 191</a>.</p>

<p>“Private nonprofit organizations are employers,&#8221; Abercrombie said in a statement. &#8220;Like all businesses, they are relying on government to follow through on its commitments. We need to get our economy moving and this is a first step.”</p>

<p>Of the $23.7 million appropriated for community programs: Catholic Charities Hawaii will receive $350,000, Kapahulu Center will receive $300,000, Moiliili Community Center will receive $150,000, and Waikiki Community Center will receive $150,000.</p>

<p>Because some of the allocated funds may have to go through the state procurement process, the Abercrombie said his administration will have to work across departments and in collaboration with community organizations to ensure that the funds are deployed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The State Department of Budget and Finance coordinated the release of these funds. Abercrombie nominated Kalbert Young as the department&#8217;s director and Dean Hirata as deputy director.</p>

<p>Hirata, 53, is the former Chief Financial Officer of Central Pacific Bank. Hirata, a Certified Public Accountant, has 30 years of experience in banking both in the public and private sectors. Hirata graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.</p>

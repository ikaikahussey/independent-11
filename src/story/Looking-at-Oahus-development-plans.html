<p>HONOLULU&#8212;There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about the recently revised <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/revised-land-use-plans-for-koolau-loa-north-shore-available-for-review/" title="Koolau Loa Sustainable Communities Plan (SCP) draft">Koolau Loa Sustainable Communities Plan (SCP) draft</a>. The biggest change in the SCP is BYUH&#8217;s Envision Laie Development, a project that would substantially increase the number of residences and businesses in the rural area. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20101008_Housing_project_generates_strife.html" title="The clash">The clash</a> between people who want to &#8220;keep the country country&#8221; and the others who tout the project&#8217;s ability to bring in more jobs will likely continue as public comment on the plans are accepted up until December 15.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Honolulu Planning Commission, and then the City Council, will vote on its adoption.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t forget that there are seven other regions whose development/SCP plans are in various stages of completion: North Shore, Waianae, Ewa, Central Oahu, Koolau Poko, East Honolulu, and the Primary Urban Center (Downtown area and its surrounding neighborhoods). <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> will be informing you of the latest critical developments, so keep posted.</p>

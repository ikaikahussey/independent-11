<p>From Blue Planet&#8217;s newsletter:</p>

<blockquote><p>‘Twas the night before Christmas,<br />
And across the whole grid<br />
Santa reviewed how clean energy did&#8230;</p>

<p>PV had been hung on the rooftops with care<br />
In hopes that interconnection approvals soon would be there<br />
HECO was snug, with their IRP filed<br />
(Who knew sweet acquisition NextEra beguiled?)</p>

<p>From the PUC there arose such a clatter<br />
The Commission scoffed and rejected the matter.<br />
They offered Inclinations as a roadmap to follow<br />
But big transformation&#8217;s a hard pill to swallow.</p>

<p>Rosenblum bid farewell; Oshima grabbed the reins<br />
But HECO&#8217;s revamped power plans still had the same old pains.<br />
Nonetheless, Santa noted, there is change underway.<br />
He said, “We’ve not yet crossed the Rubicon, but we’re well past the New Day.”</p>

<p>The solar guys said, &#8220;Hey don’t you worry about the size.<br />
People want their PV, and inverters can help with grid ties.&#8221;<br />
It’s been more than a year and customers are waiting in line<br />
But HECO’s slow to plug in, and they’re saying it’s just cuz da kine:</p>

<p>It’s all about the grid; it’s not safe—no storage.<br />
So they put out RFPs, making plans for storage.<br />
Look, here comes KIUC—with big plans for storage…<br />
They’re bringing hydro back!</p>

<p>Clean mobility is on the rise… 3,000 EVs on island streets<br />
Next up, how about hydrogen and biodiesel for our fleets?<br />
The King Street cycle track will lower VMTs<br />
And Uber and Lyft are moving people where they please.</p>

<p>Hats off to bold thinking, Dutch Kuyper, Ron Binz!<br />
Where technology leaves off, Energy Excelerator begins.<br />
Kudos to HSWAC, Makani Wind, and Stem<br />
Here’s to tomorrow’s clean power, enabled by on-bill and GEMS.</p>

<p>HCEI 2.0 reaffirms that our future will be green<br />
Now the only “magical” thinking is that natural gas is clean.</p>

<p>From Santa’s perch above the pali, two solar farms did appear<br />
He thought about the daily load as he went to pack his gear.<br />
On Hawaii Energy! On Honeywell! Efficiency is always nigh.<br />
With proper pricing and demand response, we’ll teach this duck to fly!</p>

<p>Flanked by Blue Planeteers on his left and on his right,<br />
Santa&#8217;s LED-lit, electric sleigh took off into the night<br />
We heard him call to everyone as he rolled right out of sight,&nbsp; <br />
“Merry Christmas to all! 100% clean energy sure looks bright!”</p>

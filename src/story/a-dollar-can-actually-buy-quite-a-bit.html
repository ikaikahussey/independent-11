<p>Not true, however: a dollar will buy you a <a href="http://bigislandnow.com/2014/02/21/regents-approve-tmt-lease-permit-still-under-cloud/">prime spot on Mauna Kea</a> or <a href="http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/09/22/editorial/viewpoints.html">a 65-year lease to Makua Valley</a>. Surely that&#8217;s a fair price.</p>

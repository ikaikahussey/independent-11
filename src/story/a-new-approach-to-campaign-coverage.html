<p>The 2012 election season is right around the corner. Campaign signs are going up; soon, we&#8217;ll see hundreds of lei-clad women and men lining our roads and boulevards, flashing smiles and shakas to us as they ask for our votes.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s an election year in Hawaii nei.</p>

<p>The Independent is trying a new approach to covering the campaigns. We&#8217;re going to focus on journalism that helps voters make better informed decisions. Instead of covering the &#8216;horse race&#8217; (<i>who&#8217;s up? who&#8217;s down? Etc.</i>), we&#8217;re going to ask you which issues the candidates should be discussing, and use that agenda to guide our coverage. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s several reasons for adopting this approach. </p>

<p>First, there&#8217;s a lot at stake, with all state races up for grabs. </p>

<p>Second, the traditional &#8216;horse race&#8217; approach doesn&#8217;t help us to make better choices as a community. </p>

<p>Third, our civic life could use more dialogue, particularly between groups that don&#8217;t often come into communication. With that in mind, we&#8217;re going to use the Independent as a place to weave together disparate voices into a real conversation.</p>

<p>So, here&#8217;s our central question: What issues should the candidates be discussing? What should we be discussing, as a community?</p>

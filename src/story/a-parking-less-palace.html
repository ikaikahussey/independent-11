<p>KHON quotes Ward:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Look a the those ugly cars. Is this a palace or is this a parking lot? Or a used car lot for Hawaiian kingdoms?&#8221; says Rep. Gene Ward, (R) Hawaii Kai, Kalama Valley.</p>

<p>Ward says it shouldn&#8217;t be a question, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s apparent to everyone that we honor the Hawaiian tradition and culture, why don&#8217;t we honor Iolani Palace by getting those cars off.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parking is already at a premium in downtown Honolulu. Access to the Capitol building is already very difficult, so why make it harder?</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Gov. Neil Abercrombie announced on Thursday the appointment of Marc Alexander as the Governor’s Coordinator on Homelessness.</p>

<p>The governor said Alexander will work with State and federal agencies, community programs and foundations, and the business community to find opportunities and solutions to address &#8220;homelessness&#8221; collaboratively. </p>

<p>“Our administration is dedicated to investing in the people of Hawaii and ending homelessness,&#8221; Abercrombie said in a statement. &#8220;Marc will lead a multi-faceted approach that requires collaboration among many departments, organizations, lawmakers, and programs.” </p>

<p>Alexander, 52, was most recently the Vicar General and Moderator of the Curia for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. </p>

<p>As Vicar General of the Catholic Church in Hawaii, Alexander oversaw the operations of the statewide 1,300-employee operation. </p>

<p>Born in Japan and raised in Hawaii, Alexander has served in the islands for over 25 years. He studied in Indiana, Belgium, and Italy, receiving Doctorate in Sacred Theology from Gregorian University in Rome. </p>

<p>&#8220;Through this position, I hope to honor all the public and private servants who have worked tirelessly to address the fundamental need of shelter, for the good of all residents,&#8221; Alexander said. </p>

<p>Abercrombie&#8217;s &#8220;New Day in Hawaii&#8221; plan calls for investing in people and programs to end cycles of poverty, prevent family violence, nurture and sustain physical and social health, address physical and social barriers facing the disabled, and reduce &#8220;homelessness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor&#8217;s strategy intends to:</p>

<p>* Access federal dollars and rebuild the safety net<br />
* Build workforce housing through public-private partnerships<br />
* Develop asset-building programs to address poverty and grow the middle class<br />
* Lead a comprehensive inter-governmental approach to &#8220;homelessness&#8221;<br />
* Invest in early childhood<br />
* Rebuild the mental health system<br />
* Reframe our approach to aging<br />
* Secure adequate funds and build capacity to serve compact migrants</p>

<p>“One year ago we faced a daunting $1.2 billion deficit forcing us to make tough decisions to rebuild our fiscal situation,” Abercrombie said in a statement. “Now, I submit this budget, which is in the black, for the Legislature’s consideration to build on our New Day agenda, which will result in stimulating the economy and creating jobs.”</p>

<p>Abercrombie said the main objectives of the budget are to restore the safety net of the Hurricane Relief and Rainy Day funds, provide for education, maintain essential services, and pay for initiatives set forth in his <a href="http://newdayhawaii.org/" target="_blank">New Day</a> plan without relying on tax increases.</p>

<p>The Governor’s Budget proposes to restore $174 million to the Hurricane Relief and Rainy Day funds during through 2013 with $75 million in the current fiscal year. The effort would be funded by premiums buyers paid to the State in the <a href="http://thehi.tv/story/abercrombie-touts-sale-of-general-obligation-bonds-states-credit-rating" target="_blank">recent sale of its highly-sought bonds</a>. On December 1, that the State sold $1.28 billion of General Obligation Bonds.</p>

<p>The Budget also includes additional Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) that would require another $300 million of General Obligation Bonds. The CIP projects address critical infrastructure needs that are shovel-ready and will provide the most immediate impact and job creation, Abercrombie said.</p>

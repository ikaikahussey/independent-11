<p>Governor Abercrombie <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hawaii-governor-inouye-deathbed-drama-20140411,0,2411498.story#axzz2yttPXyzb">said in an interview</a> with Mark Z. Barabak of the L.A. Times that late US Senator Daniel Inouye didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;dying wish&#8221; for his seat to go to Colleen Hanabusa. It would be far stronger for Governor Abercrombie to articulate his reasons for picking Brian Schatz, and say no more about the Inouye letter.</p>

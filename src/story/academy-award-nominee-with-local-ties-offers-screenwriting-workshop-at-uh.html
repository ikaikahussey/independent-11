<p>HONOLULU &#8212; In her upcoming <a href="http://www.outreach.hawaii.edu/pnm" target="_blank">UH Outreach College/Pacific New Media</a> workshop,<em> The Business of Screenwriting</em>, Academy Award nominee Iris Yamashita discusses the process of selling a finished screenplay: getting a foot in the door in Hollywood, finding an agent, and everything else required of a screenwriter until the film is &#8220;green-lit.&#8221; Day Two includes individual and group exercises and an opportunity to workshop existing story ideas or come up with new ideas in a pitch-able format.</p>

<p>Born in Missouri, then raised in Hawaiâ€˜i (attending Punahou School), Iris Yamashita is the screenwriter for Clint Eastwood&#8217;s film,<em> Letters from Iwo Jima</em>, which was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound Editing (winning for Best Sound Editing). </p>

<p>Two of Yamashita&#8217;s short stories have been published in All Nippon Airway&#8217;s inflight magazine, <em>Wingspan</em>, after twice winning first place in their international short fiction contest. One of her screenplays won first place honors in the Big Bear Lake Screenwriting Competition. There, she was approached by Cathy Tarr at CAA, who was a presiding judge for the competition and who now represents her.<br />

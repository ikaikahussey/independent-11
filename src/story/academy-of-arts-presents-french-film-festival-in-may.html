<p>Hawaii Premiere: <em>Potiche</em><br />
Director: François Ozon<br />
France, 2010, 103 mins<br />
In French with English subtitles</p>

<p>Acclaimed writer-director François Ozon twists a 1980 hit comic play on its head to create his own satirical, hilarious take on the war between the sexes and classes. Potiche stars Catherine Deneuve as Suzanne Pujol, a submissive trophy wife (or “potiche”). When her tyrannical husband is taken hostage by striking workers at the umbrella factory he runs, Suzanne takes control. Gérard Depardieu plays a former union leader and Suzanne’s still-burning ex-flame. Official Selection: Venice Film Festival 2010, Toronto International Film Festival 2010.</p>

<p><strong>May 22 at 1 + 4pm</strong></p>

<p><em>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</em><br />
Director: Jacques Demy<br />
France, 1964, 91 mins<br />
In French with English subtitles</p>

<p>Catherine Deneuve shines as young beauty Geneviève in the candy-colored musical that shot her to international fame. When Geneviève falls for rough-around-the-edges mechanic Guy (Nino Castelnuovo), much to the disapproval of her well-to-do mother, he is suddenly called up for military service in Algeria. Jacques Demy’s classic tale of star-crossed love rivals any MGM great, glistening with super-stylish costume design, stunning choreography and an epic score. Winner of the Palme D’Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival.<br />

In French with English subtitles</p>

<p>Did you know Mozart had an older—and equally talented—sister? In this speculative account of Maria Anna “Nannerl” Mozart (Marie Féret), she has given way to Wolfgang as the main attraction. Forbidden to play the violin or compose, Nannerl chafes at the limitations imposed on her gender. But a friendship with the son and daughter of Louis XV offers an alternative. Official Selection: Chicago International Film Festival 2010, Palm Springs, International Film Festival 2011, New York Rendez Vous with French Cinema, 2011.

<p>Mezzo-soprano Laurie Rubin, whom New York Times music critic Anthony Tommasini has praised for her “compelling artistry,” sings Ch’io mi scrodi de te, K. 505, considered to be one of Mozart’s greatest arias for soprano, piano obbligato and orchestra. Award-winning clarinetist and pianist Jennifer Taira recently gave a career-making solo performance with the Burbank Philharmonic. Taira, who is from Mililani and resides in New York, is co-founder and Artistic &amp; Executive Director of Ohana Arts, a new performing arts festival and school in Hawaii. <br />

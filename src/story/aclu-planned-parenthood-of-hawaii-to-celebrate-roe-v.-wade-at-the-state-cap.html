<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Supporters and advocates will gather Friday, January 21 from 10:00 a.m. at the State Capitol Rotunda in commemoration of the 38th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s Roe v. Wade decision.</p>

<p>On January 21, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized for the first time that an individual’s fundamental right to privacy includes a woman’s right to reproductive choice. The Roe v. Wade decision came three years after the State of Hawaii declared its own position on reproductive freedom when it became the first state to legislatively decriminalize abortion. At the time, Hawaii Gov. John Burns stated that doing so was “in the best interest of all the people of Hawaii.”</p>

<p>This year, on Roe’s 38th anniversary, Planned Parenthood of Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii will join supporters and advocates to celebrate the decision that opened the door to greater protections for reproductive rights.</p>

<p>On her first trip to Hawaii, Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, will be speaking at the celebration.</p>

<p>“We’re very excited to host Cecile and share with her Hawaii’s Aloha Spirit and its long and proud history of protecting reproductive health and freedoms,” said Katie Reardon, Planned Parenthood of Hawaii’s Director of Government Relations and Public Affairs. </p>

<p><i>The Hawaii Independent&#8217;s Downtown editor is currently reconnecting with his Irish heritage on his honeymoon throughout Ireland. He&#8217;s sending us back the details. <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/columns/read/blog-a-hawaii-couples-adventures-in-eire/" title="Read part 1 here">Read part 1 here</a>. Keep checking back for more musings from a Hawaii boy in Ireland.</i></p>

<p>We left Dublin on Wednesday, headed south for Waterford. I&#8217;m happy to report that I&#8217;m more at ease as a passenger now, although I&#8217;ve admittedly missed a lot of the Irish countryside due to the fact that my eyes have been closed much of the way in order to keep my heart in my chest.</p>

<p>We did, however, manage to get briefly lost&#8212;it is here that I will reiterate that Wifey is driving. With the help of a teen-aged bogtrotter (think hillbilly), we were soon righted and back on course to Glendalough, the preposterously tranquil site of a monastery dating back over 1500 years. After a long and well marked and maintained walk along the lower lake, we took in the ruins and gravestones of Saint Kevin&#8217;s. Along with busloads of geriatric tourists from, we would learn, Indiana. Talk about a non sequitir. But the import and impact of the site was more than palpable.</p>

<p>We rallied for Waterford Castle further south, where we hustled to the golf course for a round on the island that is home to what is actually more like a country manor&#8212;at those prices, we could afford to be semantic. It hailed on us on the first hole before clearing into a beautiful evening. When was the last time you finished a round of golf at 9:00 p.m.? Supper was grand.</p>

<p>We lit out for Cork after a brilliant Irish breakfast the next day, stopping for lunch at Reddy&#8217;s in Carlow, a pub founded in 1768. The bar matron was obviously there for the ribbon-cutting, and although the service was slow, the food was good and reasonably priced.</p>

<p>We checked in to our hotel Cork and popped across the street for a bite at Shelbourne&#8217;s, where I had what is quite possibly the greatest food item I&#8217;ve ever had in my life: a bacon and cheese bap (sounds like &#8220;bape&#8221;). I also had my first Beamish Stout Ale, possibly the greatest beverage I&#8217;ve ever had in my life. This after innumerable Guiness pints in the land from which they hail.</p>

<p>We met lad from Cork at Shelbourne&#8217;s, Corry, who confided that there is no way to understand cricket if you&#8217;re not born with a bat in your hand and &#8220;a wicket up your arse.&#8221; He was more loose and friendly than you&#8217;d expect from a well-traveled electrical engineer for Apple. He proved to be our man, taking us to an Anna Banana&#8217;s clone and then a blues bar where the stellar band was playing for a children&#8217;s literacy charity. Wifey peeled off for the hotel, and Corry took me to a bar full of what appeared to be murderous Russians gangsters. I was rattled and made my own way back to the hotel by cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are ye finding Ireland, then, lad?&#8221; asked the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m loving how green it is,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine the sheep ever going hungry here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Or lonely!&#8221;</p>

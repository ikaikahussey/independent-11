<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Supporters of preserving Oahu&#8217;s ag land are <a href="http://kahea.org/events/save-oahu-farmlands-rally-at-the-state-capitol" target="_blank">preparing to rally</a> against the proposed Hoopili Subdivision in the Honouliuli ahupuaa on the Ewa plains. The subdivision is being pushed by U.S. housing developer D.R. Horton Company.</p>

<p>On Thursday, June 30, the State Land Use Commission will be considering D.R. Horton Company&#8217;s motion for a second amended petition to rezone 1,555 acres of prime A and B agricultural lands for urban use to build 12,000 houses.</p>

<p>The State Department of Agriculture stated that the development would take away 13.7 percent of Oahu&#8217;s ag lands. </p>

<p>D.R. Horton Company stated in its petition that approximately 10,900 acres of agricultural land would remain available in Kunia and the North Shore (3,150 acres in Kunia and 7,750 acres in the North Shore).</p>

<p>Save Oahu Farmlands Alliance (SOFA) is opposed to the development and will be rallying from 8:30 a.m. outside of the Land Commission Meeting held at Leiopapa A Kamehameha building (235 S. Beretania, Room 204) on Thursday, June 30.</p>

<p>SOFA states on its <a href="http://www.saveoahufarmlands.org/the-issue/" target="_blank">website</a>: &#8220;[D.R. Horton Company representatives] have ignored and downplayed the critical matters, like food security and perhaps survival of future generations on Oahu in an uncertain age of escalating oil prices. We hope to set the record straight and reveal some truths about the real value of preserving this farmland. ‘Value’ is often not measurable as money. In fact, the most important things in life cannot be valued in monetary terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1961, the Hawaii State Legislature determined that a lack of adequate controls had caused the development of Hawaii’s limited and valuable land for short-term gain for the few while resulting in long-term loss to the income and growth potential of our State’s economy. Development of scattered subdivisions, creating problems of expensive yet reduced public services, and the conversion of prime agricultural land to residential use, were key reasons for establishing the state-wide zoning system.</p>

<p>To administer this state-wide zoning law, the Legislature established the Land Use Commission. The Commission is responsible for preserving and protecting Hawaii’s lands and encouraging those uses to which lands are best suited.</p>

<p><i>Emailed testimony must be sent to luc@dbedt.hawaii.gov by Wednesday, June 29 so that the LUC can process it for the Thursday hearing.</i></p>

<p><b>Land Use Commission Meeting<br />

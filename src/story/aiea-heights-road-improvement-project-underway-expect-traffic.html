<p>AIEA&#8212;The City is planning to begin roadway improvements to provide lateral support for a segment of Aiea Heights Drive.</p>

<p>The project location is Aiea Heights Drive between the road’s horseshoe turn and Analio Place. </p>

<p>Utility relocation work is expected to begin Monday, March 7 and the main construction work is scheduled to follow. The construction should be completed by the end of June.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The project will include road and slope stabilization (micropiles with concrete caps, tiebacks, and soil nails) and pavement restoration (including installation of curbs, concrete guardrails, pavement markings and markers, and temporary and permanent joint pole relocation).&nbsp;  </p>

<p>During construction, one of the two existing travel lanes will be closed so crews can work safely.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Motorists should expect delays as traffic will be diverted to the remaining lane in a contra-flow pattern with the assistance of Honolulu Police off-duty officers and flagmen stationed above and below the road closure. To expedite the road improvements, the contractor will work extended hours Mondays through Fridays, and also work on Saturdays. No construction is expected on Sundays. </p>

<p>The City’s contractor for the project is Schnabel Foundation Company, Inc., and the work is expected to cost $1.5 million.</p>

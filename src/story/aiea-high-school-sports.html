<p>AIEA&#8212;With widely advertised high school sport seasons like boys and girls basketball now over, it&#8217;s time for the less mentioned spring season sports that are heavily packed with talented athletes. The Na Alii of Aiea High School find themselves already in the middle of the action as they fight to see postseason play. </p>

<p>Many have looked to the neighboring Pearl City Chargers to be stronger in spring sports, particularly in baseball and volleyball. And with many other strong OIA west division teams, Aiea has found it difficult this season to be seen as a tough competitor in the mix.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have anything super outstanding, no one that is burning up the league, but all of our teams right now are more than just average,&#8221; said Blake Moritsugu, Aiea&#8217;s athletic director. &#8220;All of the teams are just fighting through the season to get to playoffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls softball team seem to have playoffs already in mind currently posting a 4-2 record tied for first place with Waialua in the OIA White west division. The Na Alii have two more weeks left in the regular season.</p>

<p>Aiea&#8217;s golf team is also gearing up for a big finish. Junior Ryan Kuroiwa started the season strong tying for first in the first OIA tournament with teammate Jay Oshita. Kuriowa has performed consistently finishing in the top 10 in five of six matches he has competed in.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While team championships may be out of reach for other teams, hopes are still very high for sports that feature singles competition, like Aiea&#8217;s judo program. </p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing okay,&#8221; said Moritsugu, who is also adviser and coordinator of Aiea&#8217;s judo program. &#8220;We&#8217;re in the middle of the season and rankings right now. Realistically as a team we might not have chance to win the OIA&#8217;s. We&#8217;ve won a few matches but as for states since it&#8217;s all individuals we do have a few that can succeed.&#8221;</p>

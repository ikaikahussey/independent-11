<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/aikeaivote">Aikea</a>, a grassroots coalition led and organized by <a hef="http://unitehere5.org">UNITE HERE Local 5</a>, announced today that it will take on one of Hawaii&#8217;s most powerful politicians: <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/memberpage.aspx?member=say">Calvin Say</a>, the speaker of the State House.</p>

<p>Keiko Bonk, a <a href="http://www.greenhawaii.org">Green party</a> member and former chair of the Hawaii Island county council, is challenging Say for House District 20, essentially Palolo Valley.</p>

<p>From an email sent today by Local 5 organizer Cade Watanabe:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our work in House District 20 is not just about House District 20.&nbsp; Here we have a clear choice between two visions for our community.&nbsp; We can either settle for the same &#8216;ole politicians that let mainland companies and big bank developers destroy our land, and our community (by passing laws like PLDC) OR we can elect someone that believes in us.&nbsp; Someone that will join with us as neighbors to protect our community, our schools, and our way of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I attended the May 19 meeting that launched Aikea, and Bonk attended as well. Local 5&#8217;s involvement makes Bonk&#8217;s campaign much more interesting; the union, which represents about 14,000 hotel workers, has some serious political game, and is emerging as a leader in the progressive wing of Hawaii&#8217;s union movement.</p>

<p>Calvin Say responded with the following comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I respect Local 5&#8217;s right to make the endorsement. I look forward to a positive campaign. If re-elected, I will continue to work with the rank-and-file of all unions, including Local 5.</p>

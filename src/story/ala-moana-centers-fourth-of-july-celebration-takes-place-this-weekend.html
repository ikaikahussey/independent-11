<p>HONOLULU&#8212;For the 19th consecutive year, Ala Moana Center is hosting Hawaii’s largest fireworks spectacular, happening on Independence Day.</p>

<p>Festivities happening throughout the holiday weekend from July 2 to 5 include award-winning entertainment, a Stars &amp; Stripes giveaway, and shopping and savings for the entire family.</p>

<p>Ala Moana Center’s Fourth of July fireworks dazzle audiences each year with vibrant and colorful displays. As Hawaii’s largest fireworks production and among the top 25 largest in the country, the only fireworks show launches from three separate platforms, with more than 1,800 shells firing over the course of the stunning 18-minute display. In addition, spectators can tune in to KUMU 94.7 FM for a live fireworks soundtrack that accompanies the show. The fireworks spectacular, launched from Ala Moana Beach Park, will begin on Sunday, July 4 at 8:30 p.m., and free open seating on Ala Moana Center’s Makai-Ewa Parking Deck will be available on a first come, first served basis. Throughout the day, attendees are encouraged to come early to enjoy the live entertainment, choose from a variety of delicious dining options, as well as shop, save, and celebrate with Ala Moana Center’s 20 Percent Savings Pass.</p>

<p>Leading up to the fireworks extravaganza on July 4, there will be free performances by a star-studded lineup of local artists including Na Hoku Hanohano and Grammy Award winners. On July 3, performances by Marlene Baldueza, Eric Lee, KONA, and the 11th Army Band will be featured at Ala Moana Centerstage from 12:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Preceding the fireworks spectacular on July 4 will be live entertainment from noon until 5:00 p.m. at Centerstage by John Cruz, Sean Naauao, Melveen Leed, and Kaleo Del Sol. Performances will continue on the parking deck by the Navy Military Band, Makana, Anuhea, Natural Vibrations, A Touch of Gold, and Amy Hanaiali‘i Gilliom from 5:00 p.m. until the fireworks show at 8:30 p.m.</p>

<p>In addition to the fireworks spectacular and award-winning entertainment, Ala Moana Center is offering a 20 Percent Savings Pass, valid throughout the entire holiday weekend from July 2-5. Offered only once a year, more than 60 stores will be accepting the pass, which gives customers 20 percent off the purchase of one regular-priced item per store, per day.

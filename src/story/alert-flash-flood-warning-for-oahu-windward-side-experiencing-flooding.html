<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a Flash Flood Warning for Oahu from Kaneohe to Maunawili. Spotters reported flooding along Kaneohe Bay Drive. The area of heavy rain was nearly stationary.</p>

<p>Other locations in the warning include but are not limited to Kailua, Waimanalo, Waiahole, Waikane, Kaneohe, Kaneohe Marine Corps Base, Hawaii Kai, and Kahaluu.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Warning means flash flooding is imminent or occurring in streams, roads, and low lying areas and people in the storm’s path should move to higher ground now.</p>

<p>At 5:45 p.m., the National Weather Service issued the warning through 8:45 p.m. The Flash Flood Warning may be extended if flooding persists.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Watch continues for Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu through late Wednesday, February 23.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Watch continues for Kahoolawe, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Hawaii Island through the morning on Friday, February 25.</p>

<p>Flash floods occur during extended rainfall events or within a few hours after the rainfall, according to the Pacific Disaster Center. Generally, if rainfall is of long enough duration, it will eventually cause flooding along the rivers, creeks, and streams draining the catchment area where the rain is being collected. But if the intensity of the rain—the number of inches of rain falling in a given time frame—is too great for the stream system, including flood plains, to carry the water away, flash flooding occurs.</p>

<p>The words “watch” and “warning” are used for two different levels of flood alerts. A flash flood watch or flood watch means that flooding or flash flood is possible in the area. The basic message of a flood watch is exactly what it sounds like: “Watch closely, conditions suggest a high likelihood of flooding.” When the word “watch” is replaced by the word “warning,” flooding or flash flooding is imminent or already beginning to occur. If you are in a low-lying or flood-prone area, act immediately to ensure the safety of your family. When a warning is issued, it is too late to prepare property to withstand flooding. You may have only seconds to act.</p>

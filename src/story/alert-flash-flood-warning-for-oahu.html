<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a Flash Flood Warning for Oahu until 10:30 a.m. this Friday, June 3.</p>

<p>At 7:19 a.m., radar showed heavy rain over several areas of Oahu. The heaviest rain has been over the windward slopes from Kailua to Kahuku.</p>

<p>A large thunderstorm with heavy rain will reach Hauula, Laie, and Kahuku areas by 8:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Heavy rain is also over Leeward areas from Pearl City to Nanakuli. Emergency management officials reported that Kapaa Quarry Road has been closed.</p>

<p>Other locations in the warning include, but are not limited to, Wahiawa, Punaluu, Waialua, Laie, Kaawa, Haleiwa, Mililani, Waipahu, Kunia, Waipio, Waianae, and Aiea.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Warning means flash flooding is imminent or occuring in streams, roads, and low lying areas. Move to higher ground now. Do not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle or on foot. Turn around, donâ€™t drown.</p>

<p>The Flash Flood Warning for Oahu may need to be extended beyond 10:39 a.m. if flash flooding persists. This current Flash Flood Warning replaces the Flood Advisory that was previously in effect for Oahu.</p>

<p>MAUI&#8212;The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a Flash Flood Warning for Maui until 11:15 a.m. At 8:19 a.m., Radar showed heavy rain along a line extending from 8 miles west of Lahaina to Ulupalakua, 22 miles west of Kahului to 19 miles south of Kahului, moving northeast at 20 mph. Additional heavy showers extend 30 miles offshore to the southwest.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Warning means flash flooding is imminent or occuring in streams, roads, and low lying areas. Move to higher ground now. Do not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle or on foot. Turn around, don&#8217;t drown.</p>

<p>The Flash Flood Warning for Maui may need to be extended beyond 11:15 a.m. if flash flooding persists.</p>

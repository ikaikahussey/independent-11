<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Honolulu National Weather Service issued a Flash Flood Watch for Kauai and Niihau through the morning on Friday, February 18.</p>

<p>A moist and unstable atmosphere will bring a threat of heavy showers and flash flooding.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding, a very dangerous situation.</p>

<p>Monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action should a Flash Flood Warning be issued.</p>

<p>The storm passing through the islands is a slow moving cold front that will move gradually through the islands from Thursday night to Friday morning. There may be brief heavy downpours which can temporarily reduce visibilities and produce ponding that can make driving difficult.</p>

<p>A high surf advisory also is in effect throughout the islands (North and Windward sides) until 6:00 a.m. on Friday, February 18. Surf 6-to-9 feet will be joined by rip currents that can easily overpower even strong swimmers. Minor coastal erosion along shores are also expected.</p>

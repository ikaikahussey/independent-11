<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The National Weather Service in Honolulu announced a Flash Flood Watch through the afternoon of Friday, March 4 for Kauai and Oahu.</p>

<p>A Developing low pressure system west of the islands has drawn moist and unstable air from the tropics to Kauai County and Oahu today. A front associated with this low pressure system is expected to reach Kauai Friday, bringing possibly more heavy rainfall to the western islands.</p>

<p>Moist and unstable atmospheric conditions will persist, increasing the potential for localized heavy showers.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding, a very dangerous situation. Monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action  should a Flash Flood Warning be issued.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A Flash Flood Watch is now in effect for Kauai, Niihau, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Hawaii Island, and Oahu through late Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Moist and unstable atmospheric conditions associated with an upper level trough will maintain the possibility of heavy rainfall and a slight chance of thunderstorms.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding, a very dangerous situation. </p>

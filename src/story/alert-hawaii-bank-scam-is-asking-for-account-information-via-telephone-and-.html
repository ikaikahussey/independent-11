<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The <a href="http://www.hawaiiba.org" title="Hawaii Bankers Association">Hawaii Bankers Association</a> recently provided an alert, warning all Hawaii banking customers of a telephone scam. The scam calls or texts individuals in an attempt to acquire your account information.</p>

<p>The automated recorded phone message identifies itself as calling from a local bank and informs the recipient that their account is being deactivated. </p>

<p>The reported fraudulent text message includes a number to call that requests their 16 digit credit card number. Anyone who receives this call is advised to hang up immediately and to delete the text message.</p>

<p>If you have responded to a questionable phone call, text message, or email, contact your bank’s customer service department. Customer service numbers are also listed on the back of credit cards.</p>

<p>The Hawaii Bankers Association wants consumers to know that they should never respond to such requests. No legitimate financial institution will ever solicit its customers for personal account information over the phone, via text message or online.</p>

<p>The Association also advises consumers:</p>

<p>* Be wary of unsolicited phone calls requesting account information over the phone or by text or email even if they claim or appear to be on behalf of a bank familiar to you.</p>

<p>* Verify that the phone number that is calling you is indeed your bank’s phone number or that the website is authentic before making any transaction. </p>

<p>* Always type the website URL address yourself, never click on a link that could re-direct you to a fraudulent website. If you fall victim to a phishing fraud, act immediately to protect yourself by alerting your financial institution, placing fraud alerts on your credit files and monitoring your account statements closely.</p>

<p>The Hawaii Bankers Association is a trade organization made up of member local banks, which include: American Savings Bank, Bank of Hawaii, Bank of the Orient, Central Pacific Bank, Finance Factors, First Hawaiian Bank, Hawaii National Bank, HomeStreet Bank, Ohana Pacific Bank, Pacific Rim Bank and Territorial Savings Bank.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE: The National Weather Service in Honolulu has extended the Flash Flood Warning for Oahu until 11:45 p.m. this Wednesday, January 12.</b></p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The National Weather Service in Honolulu has issued a Flash Flood Warning for Oahu until 8:45 p.m. this Wednesday, January 12.</p>

<p>At 5:40 p.m., radar showed heavy rain over North and West Oahu moving northeast at 30 miles per hour. A line of additional heavy showers will reach the Waianae Coast within an hour and will quickly cause flooding problems over already saturated ground, particularly from Waianae to Laie. </p>

<p>Repeated showers will continue to move over Oahu during the next several hours.</p>

<p>Other locations in the warning include Haleiwa, Makaha, Wahiawa, Mililani, Kapolei, Ewa, Waipahu, Pearl City, Kahuku, Hauula, and Punaluu.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Warning means flash flooding is imminent or occuring in streams, roads, and low lying areas. Move to higher ground now. Do not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle or on foot. Turn around, don&#8217;t drown.</p>

<p>The Flash Flood Warning for Oahu may need to be extended beyond 8:45 p.m. if flash flooding persists. This current Flash Flood Warning replaces the Flood Advisory that was previously in effect for Oahu.</p>

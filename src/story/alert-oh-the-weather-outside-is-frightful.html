<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Oh the weather outside is certainly frightful going into the weekend, thanks to the showers, thunderstorms, and snow (for Hawaii Island) making its way across the islands. The temperature also got as low as 64 degrees Fahrenheit this morning.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) in Honolulu said flooding is possible across all islands today, Friday, December 10. The showers and thunderstorms ahead of a cold front will move over the islands at times until the front passes. The thunderstorms and heavier showers will pose a threat of flooding, especially since earlier precipitation has saturated the ground across much of the state.</p>

<p><b>A Flash Flood Watch has been issued for all islands</b> throughout the state till late tonight. A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding&#8212;a very dangerous situation particularly for campers and hikers.</p>

<p><b>A Flood Advisory was issued for Molokai and Maui</b> until 10:15 a.m. The advisory has been extended for Maui until 3:45 p.m. Friday. Radar showed moderate to heavy rain across most areas on Molokai. The ground is saturated and ponding on roads may make driving hazardous. Molokai and Maui residents are advised to stay away from streams, drainage ditches, and low lying areas prone to flooding. Rainfall and runoff will also cause hazardous driving conditions due to ponding, reduced visibility and poor braking action. Do not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle or on foot.</p>

<p>NWS has issued a <b>Winter Storm Warning for heavy snow on Hawaii Island</b>, which is possible until 6:00 a.m. Saturday. Deep moisture is expected to spread over Hawaii Island Friday and Saturday. The abundant moisture combined with cold temperatures will bring heavy snow and freezing rain to the summit areas above 12,000 feet. Total snowfall amounts in excess of 6 inches are expected.</p>

<p>A winter storm warning means significant amounts of snow, sleet, and ice are expected or occurring, making travel very hazardous or impossible. Strong winds are also possible.</p>

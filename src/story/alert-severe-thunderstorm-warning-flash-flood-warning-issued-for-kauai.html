<p>KAUAI&#8212;<a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=hfo&amp;wwa=all" title="The National Weather Service (NWS) in Honolulu">The National Weather Service (NWS) in Honolulu</a> has issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning and Flash Flood Warning for Kauai. </p>

<p>At 6:22 p.m., radar indicated a severe thunderstorm capable of producing damaging winds of 60 mph.</p>

<p>NWS called this a dangerous storm. If you are in its path, prepare immediately for damaging winds and deadly cloud-to-ground lightning. People outside should move to a shelter, preferably inside a strong building but away from windows.</p>

<p>The Flash Flood Warning remains in effect for Kauai until 8:15 p.m. Radar continues to show moderate to heavy rain over the entire island of Kauai with the heaviest rainfall located over the south and east side of the island. Rain gages have detected torrential rainfall falling at rates of 3 to 4 inches per hour. </p>

<p>A Flash Flood Warning means flash flooding is imminent or occurring in streams, roads, and low lying areas and people in the storm&#8217;s path should move to higher ground now.</p>

<p>Do not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle or on foot.</p>

<p>The warning may need to be extended beyond 8:15 p.m. if flash flooding persists.</p>

<p>A Special Marine Warning has also been issued for Kauai Channel and Kauai&#8217;s leeward and windward waters.</p>

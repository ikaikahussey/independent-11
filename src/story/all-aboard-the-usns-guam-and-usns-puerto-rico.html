"teaser":"US Naval Secretary Ray Mabus renamed the two Hawaii Superferry vessels – the Alakai and its sister ship, the Huakai, which never entered service in Hawaii waters – on Tuesday.   <blockquote> The selection of the name Guam honors the long-standing historical and military relationship between Guam and the United States.  This relationship began in 1898 when the United States acquired the island from Spain as a result of the “Treaty of Paris” that ended the Spanish-American War.  Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese captured Guam which they occupied until U.S. troops retook the island on July 21, 1944, a date commemorated every year as “Liberation Day”.  Guam continues to host many of the United States’ critical military installations in the Pacific Ocean.  </blockquote>",

<p>OAHU/MAUI  &#8212; The Aloha Initiative organizers today launched a Clothing Drive.&nbsp; Their mission is to collect gently used clothing for the victims of Japan affected by the March earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis and who are scheduled to arrive on Oahu and Maui on July 4.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Japan families selected for the program were on the basis of greatest personal need and circumstance. Those women, men and children selected will be flown to Hawaii and spend up to 90 days with host families willing to take the displaced residents in and provide them with a warm, nurturing environment during their time of crisis. The Aloha Initiative will be paying for ground and the discounted air transportation to and from Hawaii as well as traveler&#8217;s insurance.</p>

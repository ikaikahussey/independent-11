<p>Aloha Tower Marketplace is throwing “The Party of the Year” on New Year’s Eve. In addition to “Hawaii’s ultimate fireworks show,” there will be seven stages throughout the marketplace featuring over 20 live bands and DJs performing everything from &#8216;70s and &#8216;80s disco and funk to hip hop, reggae, and classic rock.</p>

<p>Certainly the main attraction, however, will be the fireworks display. Necks will crane at the stroke of midnight, when what has in the past been a 15-minute extravaganza lights up the sky over Honolulu Harbor. Considering the dismal past year, the party will be as much a celebration of leaving 2010 behind as it is a celebration to ring in 2011.</p>

<p><b>The Party of the Year<br />
Friday, December 31 from 8:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.<br />
Aloha Tower Marketplace<br />
Ages 21-and-over only</b></p>

<p>HONOLULU — Flu season typically reaches its peak in January and February but can last from October all the way to May. In preparation for this year&#8217;s season, ALTRES Medical, a supplemental nursing services practice, is seeking more than 300 registered nurses (RNs), nursing assistants (NAs) and medical assistants (MAs) to administer flu shots to Hawaii students and assist at school flu clinics statewide. ALTRES Medical is urging qualified applicants to apply now by visiting www.altresmedical.com.</p>

<p>For the last four years, ALTRES Medical has been chosen to manage the statewide flu clinics for the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH). The “Stop Flu at School” influenza vaccination clinics will be held on public school and private school campuses on all islands. <br />
 <br />
“The ‘Stop Flu at School’ clinics are a wonderful opportunity for nurses of all levels of experience to serve their local communities,” said Jenies Thomas, manager of ALTRES Medical (pictured). “Nurses can choose to stay in the neighborhoods they live in, work nearby, or they can request to be assigned to communities with the greatest need.”<br />
 <br />
ALTRES Medical offers competitive pay to its employees with pay rates determined by medical license category.</p>

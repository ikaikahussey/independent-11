<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Alzheimer’s disease is currently the nation’s sixth-leading cause of death. As baby boomers age, the number of individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease will rapidly escalate, according to <a href="http://www.alz.org/hawaii/" target="_blank">the Alzheimer&#8217;s Association</a>, increasing well beyond today’s estimated 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s.</p>

<p>The Alzheimer’s Association is inviting Oahu residents to take part in the <b>Alzheimer’s Association Walk to End Alzheimer’s at Ala Moana Beach Park (Magic Island) on Saturday, September 10 at 7:30 a.m.</b></p>

<p>The Hawaii chapter of the association is expecting over 1,000 participants to help share information about Alzheimer’s disease and how to get involved&#8212;from advocacy opportunities, the latest in Alzheimer’s research, and clinical trial enrollment to support programs and services.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In addition to the three mile walk, there will be live entertainment, a lucky ticket drawing, light refreshments, and a special tribute to those who have experienced or are experiencing Alzheimer’s.&nbsp; </p>

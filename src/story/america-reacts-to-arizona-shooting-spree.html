Police say suspect Jared Lee Loughner wounded 13 people, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords who was shot in the head, and left six people dead, including a federal judge, a 9-year-old child, and Giffords&#8217; aide after firing an automatic pistol with an extended magazine at a town hall style gathering.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://blog.seattlepi.com/mediamockingbird/archives/234952.asp?source=mypi" title="The Seattle Post blogged" target="_blank" >The Seattle Post blogged</a></b> about the buzz on Twitter and throughout the Internet condemning the act as &#8220;right-wing terrorism&#8221; and holding Sarah Palin responsible for the shootings. Giffords&#8217; was one of many Democratic lawmakers targeted on a map of key opponents to conservative ideals promoted by Palin heading into the last elections. Palin had been criticized for her use of cross hairs on the map in combination with rhetoric that included catch phrases such as &#8220;don&#8217;t retreat, reload.&#8221; <i>The Seattle Post</i> questioned the wisdom of the condemnations.</p>

<p>Giffords, herself, commented on the rhetoric in an interview with MSNBC last year: &#8220;For example, we&#8217;re on Sarah Palin&#8217;s targeted list, but the thing is, that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they have to realize that there are consequences to that action.&#8221;</p>

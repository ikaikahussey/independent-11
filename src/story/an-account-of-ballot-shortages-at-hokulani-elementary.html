<p>At 10:30 am, he said, officials from his precinct 20-04 (Hokulani Elementary, near the University) were on hold with command center staff for one hour.</p>

<p>And this morning, the state didn&#8217;t drop off as many boxes as they usually do, he said.</p>

<p>Instead of three boxes, they received two.</p>

<p>By 2:00 PM today, he noticed that they were running low on ballots. A lot of voters left, he said – &#8220;as many as 100.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because of the ballot shortage, Kratzke said that voters were forced to use an electronic machine, which several refused to do.</p>

<p>At 5:30, elections officials delivered more ballots to his precinct. Ballots which were rejected by the machine.</p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>&#8220;They were for 19-04&#8212;Waialae Elementary,&#8221; Kratzke said.</p>

<p>The voting machine wasn&#8217;t the only source of malcontent. Voters were also concerned that the people they wanted to vote for – Keiko Bonk, running against incumbent Calvin Say for the State House, and Ann Kobayashi, running for city council – weren&#8217;t on the ballot.</p>

<p>Kratzke&#8217;s solution was smart, though: he had several people use Japanese language ballots to ensure that their votes were recorded.</p>

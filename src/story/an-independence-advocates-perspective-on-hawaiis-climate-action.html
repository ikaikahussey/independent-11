<p>Today, June 6, 2017, Hawaii Governor David Ige signed two climate change preparedness bills into law. SB 559 expands strategies and mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide in alignment with the principles and goals adopted in the Paris Agreement, making Hawaii the first state to formally adopt these principles and goals and to formally commit to following them. The county mayors also signed municipal commitments in accord with the Paris Agreement.</p>

<p>The governor also signed HB 1578 in law, which establishes the Carbon Farming Task Force within the Office of Planning to identify agricultural and aquacultural practices to improve soil health and promote carbon sequestration in the state’s agricultural and aquaculturally sectors.<br />
 <br />
Governor Ige is doing the right thing by signing these climate action bills into law today. The governor is demonstrating that Hawaii’s long-term interests are best served by working together with the rest of the world – outside the umbrella of the United States – to solve critical environmental problems.</p>

<p>Global warming is a clear and present danger for our island home. Everyone who loves these islands should be concerned about climate change and it’s serious threats to the ecology and economy of the aina.</p>

<p>An interesting thing to note about the Kauai biotech lawsuit, announced <a href=“http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20140111_3_companies_sue_to_block_Kauais_new_law_on_GMOs_pesticides.html?id=239768391”>Friday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biotech companies are represented by top Hawaii attorneys. Paul Alston is representing Syngenta; Margery Bronster, a former state attorney general, is representing Pioneer Hi-Bred and Agrigenetics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another partner at Alston’s firm is <a href="http://ahfi.com/attorneys/william-m-kaneko.html">Bill Kaneko</a>, a longtime Abercrombie advisor. Kaneko ran the 2010 gubernatorial campaign, oversaw his transition to the 5th floor of the capitol, and is running the governor’s re-election campaign.</p>

<p>Because of attorney-client privilege between Alston and Syngenta, it would be easy for Alston and Kaneko’s law firm to act as an opaque pass-through for information and communication between the biotech firms and the state.</p>

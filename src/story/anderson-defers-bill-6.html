<p>Honolulu City Council vice chair Ikaika Anderson deferred his own &#8220;sidewalk bill&#8221; today, even before the opponents delivered their oral testimony. </p>

<p>In a press release, Anderson said: &#8220;The City must continue to keep our sidewalks clear, and encourage our homeless population to seek available services ... We must also continue to proceed in a responsible but compassionate manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The original bill (<a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-134353/7lsk1-0h.pdf">Bill 6, 2013</a>) was introduced almost a year ago and would have made putting up a tent on a sidewalk or mall a misdemeanor and would have allowed the city to seize the tent and any belongings left inside. From Bill 6: &#8220;Any person ... violating ... the terms of any permit issued under this article shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both.&#8221; </p>

<p>Anderson says he will introduce a new bill this year that would not make occupying a sidewalk with a tent a crime, but which would allow police to issue citations if a tent is not removed after a complaint is received by a member of the public.</p>

<p>Anderson is running for Congress, as is fellow city council member Stanley Chang (who also introduced a &#8220;sidewalk bill,&#8221; Bill 59, which was killed after receiving numerous opposing testimonies). Another Congressional hopeful, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KathrynXian?fref=ts">Kathryn Xian</a>, was also present today, submitting oral testimony in opposition to the bill. Xian is the only candidate who has not previously held public office. She is the executive director at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/traffickjamming">Pacific Alliance to Stop Slavery</a>.</p>

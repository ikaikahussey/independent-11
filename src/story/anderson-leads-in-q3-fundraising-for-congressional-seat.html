<p>Chad Blair, reporting for <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/10/17/20167-who-is-winning-the-cd1-campaign-money-chase/">Civil Beat</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Anderson only entered the race Aug. 8, he pulled in an impressive $163,000 in the third quarter, a lot of it from big name developers, engineers, real estate interests and contractors who may wish to curry favor with the man who chairs the city&#8217;s Zoning and Planning Committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fellow Councilmember Stanley Chang still leads in overall fundraising, though, with $309,000 in aggregate donations, $125,000 of which was raised in the last quarter.</p>

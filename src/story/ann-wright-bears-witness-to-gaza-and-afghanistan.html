<p>Activist Ann Wright is scheduled to speak on Monday, January 10 at &#8220;Witness: Afghanistan and Gaza,&#8221; a free forum sponsored by the <a href="http://afsc.org/office/honolulu-hi" title="American Friends Service Committee Hawaii Peace and Justice">American Friends Service Committee Hawaii Peace and Justice</a>.</p>

<p>Wright will report back on her recent trip to Afghanistan and the 2nd Gaza Freedom Flotilla.</p>

<p>Last June, Wright was held captive by the Israeli government after an attack on a group of international ships trying to be the first international boats to land in the port of Gaza in 41 years. Wright, a retired U.S. Army colonel and retired official of the U.S. State Department, known for her outspoken opposition to the Iraq War, was aboard the ship <i>Mavi Marmara</i> that was attempting to take supplies to Palestinians cut off by Israeli control. </p>

<p>The Free Gaza Movement, which was in charge of the supply ships, said the Israeli raid left at least 16 civilians dead. The Free Gaza Movement&#8217;s mission is “to raise international awareness about the prison-like closure of the Gaza Strip and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued Israeli occupation.”</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Earlier this year, a Hawaii court ruled that Kawaiahao Church in Downtown Honolulu had the right to continue construction on a multipurpose center after finding iwi at the site. The following notice pertaining to the handling of the iwi was published in the Tuesday classifieds of the Star-Advertiser:</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;Kawaiahao Church will be proceeding with construction of the multipurpose building. During excavation, human remains were discovered and removed and it is anticipated that additional human remains may be discovered and will be removed. This notice is provided pursuant to an agreement with Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawananakoa and is in addition to any notices required by law.</p>

<p><em>The Independent</em> is proud to announce <a href="http://summitzine.com">Summit</a>, a new quarterly magazine that showcases Hawaii&#8217;s best, for the world.</p>

<p>Summit Magazine draws on the motto of Queen Kapi‘olani, who said &#8220;Kulia i ka nu‘u,&#8221; or <em>strive for the summit</em>. The new magazine contends that Hawaii has a long history of excellence. From our remarkable emergence in the 19th century as the most literate country on the planet, to the electrification of Iolani Palace in 1886 – prior to the White House – Hawaii has exceeded world expectations of a small Pacific archipelago. Summit examines the ways in which this spirit of excellence is re-emerging in 21st century Hawaii. In technology, design, cuisine, business, politics, and education, seasoned and emerging leaders are aspiring to remake Hawaii as an island state with global aspirations.</p>

<p>Summit goes beyond the traditional Hawaii magazine, by presenting beautiful photography and eloquent prose in five sections:</p>

<p><strong>Commons</strong> covers civic issues in Hawaii and the Asia-Pacific region, with investigative reportage, profiles on civil society leaders, and briefings on key topics. This section builds on the work of<em> The Independent</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Industry</strong> profiles new businesses, entrepreneurs, and the forces that animate the economy. </p>

<p><strong>Originals</strong> taps the creative wellspring of the islands, with spotlights on artists in cuisine, music, design, and architecture. This section expands on the work of <em>INHonolulu</em> and <em>The Hum</em>, two of our partner publications.</p>

<p><strong>Anuenue</strong> guides visitors and locals to a vibrant island lifestyle, with offerings on fashion, adventures, and hidden treasures to maximize the Hawaii experience.</p>

<p><strong>Letters</strong> turns a microphone to literature, with serialized fiction, novel excerpts, short stories, and poetry.</p>

<p>Summit launches officially in May, with a cover price is $10 per issue. For a limited time, we&#8217;re offering a pre-sale price of $35 for an annual subscription (four issues).

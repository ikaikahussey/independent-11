<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A magnitute 6.6 earthquake struck off of the New Britain region of Papua New Guinea this morning, Tuesday, July 20 at 9:18 a.m. No tsunami warnings have been issued.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, there were earthquakes near Hawaii, Alaska, and Papua New Guinea within a 24 hour period.</p>

<p>Hawaii’s quake, which occurred at 3:28 p.m. Sunday, was the weakest at 3.5. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the quake originated south of Oahu, but because of sparse station coverage location confidence is poor.</p>

<p>The earthquake was reported to be felt in many parts of eastern Oahu. No tsunami warnings were issued.</p>

<p>A 7.3 earthquake rocked the New Britain region of Papua New Guinea at about 1:30 p.m. Sunday. Local tsunamis near the earthquake’s epicenter were expected but did not occur.</p>

<p>A 6.7 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska Saturday night. No tsunami warnings were issued.</p>

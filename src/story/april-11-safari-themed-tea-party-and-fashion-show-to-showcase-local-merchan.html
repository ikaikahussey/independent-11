<p>A Safari Champagne Tea PaHTY &amp; Children&#8217;s Fashion Show, a benefit for Honolulu Theatre for Youth, will be held at the Hawaii Prince Hotel on Sunday, April 11 from 11:30 a.m. to  2:30 p.m. In a twist on the traditional fundraiser event, this unique fundraiser incorporates the whole family, as the children of the attendees are the fashion show talent.</p>

<p>Event co-chairs Audra Stevenson and Aubrey Hawk are planning a Safari-themed program to evoke the exotic settings in Just So Stories, HTY&#8217;s spring production. Guests are invites to attend in costume as &#8220;the hunter&#8221; (khaki couture) or &#8220;the hunted&#8221; (animal prints). They&#8217;ll slake their desert thirst with Champagne cocktails, procure provisions from a silent auction of kid-friendly items and adventures, thrill to wild African entertainment, and refresh themselves with a scrumptious English Safari High Tea.</p>

<p>The grand finale is a parade of ferocious local wildlife, rather, a children&#8217;s runway fashion show, with production support provided by ADR Agency, directed by Audra Stevenson, and with participation from members of the HJM Scholarship Program. Hair and makeup is by Jessica Hoffman.</p>

<p>In support of Honolulu&#8217;s homegrown businesses, each of whom know it&#8217;s a retail jungle out there, the fashion show will feature the latest styles from an all-local line-up of clothiers including BECCA Beach Kahala, The Blue Buddha, Crazy Shirts, Hawaiian Moon, Jams World, Kahala Sportswear, Roxy/Quiksilver and therapy boutique, with more to come.</p>

<p>Tanzania Sponsor Tables for 10 are $2500 and include spots for up to seven models for the fashion show, VIP runway seating and photo and media opportunities for the models; Zanzibar Sponsor Tables are $1750 and include up to six models for the fashion show; Botswana Sponsor tables are $1250 and include up to three models for the fashion show; individual Congo seats are $175 and each pair of seats may offer one model. RSVP deadline is March 19. </p>

<p>The Honolulu Board of Water Supply, in partnership with the Friends of Halawa Xeriscape Garden, will be hosting its 3rd Annual Decorate an Egg, the Xeriscape Way workshop, and Easter egg hunt, which is open to keiki between the ages of 2 through 12 along with a responsible adult on Saturday, April 3 from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. at Halawa Xeriscape Garden, 99-1268 Iwaena Street, in Halawa Valley&#8217;s Central Park Industrial Area.</p>

<p>The Xeriscape Way workshop offers a fun alternative, with a twist, to the basic decoration of eggs with food coloring.</p>

<p>Keiki will create unique, naturally-inspired designs by using leaves and flowers collected from the beautiful Halawa Xeriscape Garden to decorate their eggs. They will also learn how they can conserve our precious water resource through Xeriscaping. The fun-filled and educational afternoon will conclude with an Easter egg hunt for prizes.</p>

<p>This activity is suitable for children ages 2 through 12 and all keiki must be supervised by a responsible adult.</p>

<p>The activity fee for the general public is $5.00 per family. Members of the Friends of Halawa Xeriscape Garden may attend for free.</p>

<p>Registration is required. Call Keoni Mattos at 748-5369 to reserve your seat today. Registration ends Wednesday, March 31 or when class is filled.</p>

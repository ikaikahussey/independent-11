<p><a href="http://ponoaqua.org/" title="Pono Aquaculture Alliance">Pono Aquaculture Alliance</a> (PAA) is a loosely-organized group working to advance sustainable fish farming practices including the restoration of loko ia and land-based recirculating aquaculture systems. Founding members include KAHEA, Apono Hawaii, Food &amp; Water Watch, and The Kanaka Council.</p>

<p>PAA feels that aquaculture can become a reliable source of safe and sustainable food here in Hawaii and for the world, provided basic precautionary and common sense principles are followed.</p>

<p>On Thursday, April 8 at 10:00 a.m., PAA will hold a press conference to kick off the alliance and the release of a new Food &amp; Water Watch report titled &#8220;The Empty Promise of Ocean Aquaculture in Hawaii: Lessons for the Nation from an Industrial Testing Ground.&#8221; The press conference will be located at the State Capitol next to Queen Liliuokalani&#8217;s statue.</p>

<p>PAA will also be taking part in Lobby Day at the State Capitol from 11:00 a.m. Join other members to ask for sustainable and responsible aquaculture policies. Specifically, PAA will be speaking with decision makers about concerns with <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=2409" title="HB2409">HB2409</a> that could extend leases for all aquaculture operations&#8212;including factory fish farms&#8212;up to 45 years. PAA will be encouraging decision makers to support <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HR&amp;billnumber=245" title="HR245">HR245</a> and <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HCR&amp;billnumber=326" title="HCR326">HCR326</a> which calls for a moratorium on the expansion of the ocean factory fish farm industry. <a href="https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1185/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=59055" title="Click here to sign up.">Click here to sign up.</a></p>

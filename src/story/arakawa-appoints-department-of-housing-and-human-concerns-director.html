<p>WAILUKU&#8212;Maui County Mayor-elect Alan Arakawa appointed the Department of Housing and Human Concerns deputy director Jo-Ann Ridao as the incoming director of the department.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>The director of Maui&#8217;s Department of Housing and Human Concerns is responsible for managing and overseeing the operations and budgets of seven divisions, including Housing, the Office on Aging, Kaunoa Senior Center, Immigration Services, Grants Management, the Volunteer Center, and the Early Childhood Center.</p>

<p>Prior to serving as the department&#8217;s deputy director, Ridao&#8217;s work experience includes serving as senior executive assistant under former Mayor Charmaine Tavares, managing director of Lokahi Pacific for 14 years, and a housing specialist for Maui County. Ridao was selected as Maui&#8217;s Outstanding Executive Director and SBA Small Business Advocate of the Year in 1998.</p>

<p>Arakawa also announced his appointment of Janice Shishido as incoming the Department of Housing and Human Concerns deputy director.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>A school teacher for nearly 30 years, Shishido is presently the chairperson for the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board, member of the State Political Action Committee for Hawaii State Teachers Association, State Chaplain for Alpha Delta Kappa&#8212;Hawaii Gamma Chapter, president of Kiwanis Club of the Valley Isle, and director of Brain Gym.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jo-Ann and Jan are two deeply passionate women who yearn to help people who are in need,&#8221; Arakawa said. &#8220;I am confident that their experience in the nonprofit and government sectors and leadership skills to address issues relating to affordable housing, seniors including baby boomers, immigration, and grants will be critical in taking the department to a whole, other level.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kaka‘ako has plans, big plans. It&#8217;ll be another city added to the growing island Oahu. The nearest elementary schools, Royal and Queen Ka‘ahumanu, will soon reach capacity with the planned high-rises. </p>

<p>The suggested solutions are to convert them to a multi-track school, which the Department of Education can do or add portable classrooms like Kapolei Elementary and Middle Schools did. </p>

<p>According to Ray L&#8217;Hereux, Chief of Facilities, multi-tracking may not be the best idea. &#8220;Multi-tracking, in my estimation, is an archaic way to answer a problem,&#8221; L&#8217;Hereux said. Nationally, schools are moving away from the multi-track system. Portables have limits limits, too: L&#8217;Hereux isn&#8217;t a fan of the idea, and Royal School may not have enough landportables. He&#8217;s hoping to find a solution in the next three years.</p>

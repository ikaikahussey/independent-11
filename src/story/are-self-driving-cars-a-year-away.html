<p>Dolgov was riding through a wooded area one night when the car suddenly slowed to a crawl. &#8220;I was thinking, What the hell? It must be a bug,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;Then we noticed the deer walking along the shoulder.&#8221; The car, unlike its riders, could see in the dark. Within a year, Thrun added, it should be safe for a hundred thousand miles.</p>

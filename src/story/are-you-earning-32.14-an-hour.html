<p>Locals know it&#8217;s true: this is a very expensive place to live. But it&#8217;s amazing to see, in hard numbers, just how expensive it is. A recent report by the <a href="http://nlihc.org/oor/2013">National Low Income Housing Coalition</a> spells it out, relying on data from HUD, the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Labor, and the Social Security Administration.</p>

<p>The report uses a market rent amount of $1,671 for a two-bedroom apartment; in order to afford that home without paying more than 30% of their income for housing, the household must earn a total of $32.14 an hour (or $5,571 monthly or $66,853 annually). The report calls that the &#8220;housing wage&#8221; – i.e. the necessary wage in order to maintain decent housing.</p>

<p>At a $7.25 per hour minimum wage, an employee would have to work an impossible 177 hours per week, or have more than four (4.4, to be exact) minimum-wage earners in order to make that apartment affordable. </p>

<p>In Honolulu, where the higher cost of housing requires a $35.25 per hour housing wage, making Honolulu the most expensive metropolitan area in the U.S. The next most expensive city is San Francisco, with a $34.52 per hour housing wage.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how Hawaii stands out on a state-by-state basis:</p>

<table class="table">
<tr><th>States</th><th>Housing Wage for Two-Bedroom Apartment</th></tr>
<tr><td>Hawaii</td><td>$32.14</td></tr>
<tr><td>California</td><td>$25.78</td></tr>
<tr><td>New York</td><td>$25.25</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If we were to alter a key assumption in the report&#8217;s data, by replacing a $1,671 two-bedroom rental with the lowest-priced rental currently on the market – a <a href="http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/Honolulu-HI/18615_rid/21.474476,-157.583084,21.176409,-158.018417_rect/10_zm/">$900 per month condo on Pumehana street in Moiliili</a> – a minimum-wage earner would still have to work for 124 hours in a week. This would mean working 17.7 hours a day, sleeping for six hours, and hoping to never get stuck in traffic.</p>

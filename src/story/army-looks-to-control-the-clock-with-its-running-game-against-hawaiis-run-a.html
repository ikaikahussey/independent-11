<p>&#8220;Army takes on a Hawaii team that put up more than 600 yards of offense against USC last week. Hawaii runs a run-and shoot offense that can put points up in a hurry. It will be up to Army to control the time of possession with its running game&#8212;and to be able to put points up on the board after controlling the clock.&#8221;</p>

<p><br />
Travelling 4,955 miles, this is the longest trip Hawaii has made to play a football game in the schoolâ€™s history.</p>

<p>The game will be played at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (6:00 a.m. Hawaii Time). Unfortunately, the game will not be televised in Hawaii, but you can order it on Oceanic digital cable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.armytimes.com/news/2010/06/ap_army_hawaii_native_ties_062010/" title="The Associated Press covers">The Associated Press covers</a> recent activities surrounding the sacred Makua Valley, which is under lease to the U.S. Army until 2029:</p>

<p>&#8220;The people of Waianae believe the first Hawaiians were created in Makua, a lush valley about 30 miles from downtown Honolulu. The valley is also home to three large heiau, or ancient stone platforms used for worship. So itâ€™s no surprise many Native Hawaiians consider the valley to be sacred. The Army, though, sees Makua as a prime spot for soldiers to practice firing live ammunition.&#8221;</p>

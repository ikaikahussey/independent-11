<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Eight members part of the Occupy Honolulu movement were arrested on the second night of demonstration at Thomas Square this weekend. About 40 members were sitting in the park with the intent starting a peaceful occupation prior to the arrests late Saturday, November 5.</p>

<p>The total cost for bail was $1,700, Occupy Honolulu said. The group is asking support from the community to help raise bail money to pay back those who cannot afford to pay. </p>

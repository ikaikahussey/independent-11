<div>&#8220;Muscle Car&#8221; (2008) by Elizabeth R. Curtis, Archival Inkjet Print, 24&#8221; x 36&#8221;</div>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Photographer Elizabeth R. Curtis will begin her six-week tenure as the Gallery 31 Art Studio Artist-in-Residence at the Honolulu Academy of Arts on January 23. She will be working on a project entitled The Visitors, which calls upon willing museum visitors to become the subjects of her photographic portraits.</p>

<p>?I hope that involvement in the project will cause visitors to consider the implications of portraiture, its inherent construction, and its effect on identity formation,? explains Curtis</p>

<p>Curtis will be in residence during the Academy&#8217;s weekend hours from January 23 to February 28, including Bank of Hawaii Family Sunday on February 21, and during ARTafterDARK on February 26.</p>

<p>Half-hour sittings will take place alternately in the Gallery 31 Art Studio or in the outdoor courtyards at the Academy. While Curtis envisions some of the portraits as candid shots, others will be staged in a manner similar to 19th-century photographic portraits, including props such as thick curtains and plush chairs.</p>

<p>People interested in participating as a sitter in either an individual or small group portrait can sign up at the Visitor Information Center at the Honolulu Academy of Arts upon arrival. Further information on The Visitors project and weekly portrait updates can be found at <a href="http://www.ElizabethRCurtis.com" title="www.ElizabethRCurtis.com">www.ElizabethRCurtis.com</a>.</p>

<p>Curtis expects to complete her MFA in photography from the University of Hawai?i in 2011. She received her BA in Studio Art from Wheaton College.</p>

<p>Launched in fall 2009, the Academy?s artist in residence program is made possible by the Arthur and Mae Orvis Foundation. It is open to current University of Hawai?i graduate art students and recent UH MFA recipients. Past artists in residence are Allison Uttley and Boz Schurr.</p>

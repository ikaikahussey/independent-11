<p>KALIHI&#8212;A troupe of local artists, including Solomon Enos and Meleanna Meyer, are leading the charge to involve the island community in a mural marathon the week beginning Monday, July 25.</p>

<p>The efforts are part of one of the largest and most ambitious community mural projects in Hawaii. A first of its kind and the first of a series of large scale murals covering the length of lower Kalihi Stream, the project has been coordinated by KAUPA. The event caps off a yearlong <br />
project that included art workshops, community meetings, and late night artistic brainstorming. </p>

<p>Spaces are still available for artists who are interested in painting the mural. Painting will occur July 25 to 30 from 1:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. </p>

<p>KAUPA is a nonprofit, community-based organization centered in Kalihi Valley.</p>

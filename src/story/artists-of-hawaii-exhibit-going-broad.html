<p><strong>Media Release</strong></p>

<p>The Honolulu Museum of Art’s biannual Artists of Hawai‘i exhibition marks its 60th year in 2013—and also sees a format change.</p>

<p>Launched in 1950, the exhibition has become a prestigious addition to Hawai‘i artist’s resumes. This year the show goes from being a wide-ranging survey of art, featuring one to three works by dozens of artists to an exhibition of 8 to 12 artists showing a body of work.</p>

<p>Submissions for Artists of Hawai‘i 2013 are being accepted Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. The exhibition will be held next year, Sept. 19 to Nov. 24. The year between the closing of the submission period to the opening of the exhibition will allow artists to further develop their work for the exhibition. The artwork will be selected by Jay Jensen, the musem’s Curator of Contemporary Art.</p>

<p>The prospectus, which includes submission guidelines, and FAQs on the exhibition changes are posted on the museum’s website.</p>

<p>HONOLULU – The University of Hawaii Athletics Department and ‘Ahahui Koa ‘Anuenue (AKA) will launch a reverse auction website beginning Monday, June 7, which is dedicated to distribute football parking passes at Aloha Stadium this season. In a reverse auction, sellers compete to obtain business, and prices typically decrease over time.</p>

<p>The website (<a href="http://Parking.KoaAnuenue.org" title="http://Parking.KoaAnuenue.org">http://Parking.KoaAnuenue.org</a>) will feature a reverse auction for approximately 1,700 available parking passes in the stadium’s Inner Circle (sections 8-14), Koa Lot (old bus lot), and Kam Lot. Parking passes will be offered to all football season ticket holders with two or more tickets. Information can also be found at <a href="http://www.HawaiiAthletics.com" title="www.HawaiiAthletics.com">www.HawaiiAthletics.com</a>.</p>

<p>In order to access the auction, season ticket holders of record are being mailed login information and the amount of parking passes they are eligible to obtain, while supplies last.</p>

<p>The reverse auction begins at 8:00 a.m. on Monday and will continue until all the passes are gone. Parking contribution levels begin at $400 (Inner Circle), $350 (Koa Lot), and $300 (Kam Lot) and will drop daily until June 11 or until all passes are gone, whichever occurs first.</p>

<p>Beginning on the first day of the auction, the website will display a counter of parking passes remaining as well as the current contribution level of each pass. If passes are still available on June 11, the rate will remain the same from that date until all passes are gone.</p>

<p>Proceeds from this auction will benefit the AKA Scholarship Fund and are tax deductible. Approximately 350 student-athletes benefit from this fund, which supports scholarship needs such as tuition, housing, boarding, books, etc.</p>

<p>Season ticket holders without internet access may visit or call the Stan Sheriff Center Box Office (Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., 944-2697). A representative will place your order online based on availability and at the contribution level when the order is placed.</p>

<p>Contributions must be made via MasterCard or Visa credit cards only. Transactions are final and not refundable and the parking passes are non-renewable. Parking passes will be mailed in August, separately from season tickets, provided the season tickets have been paid in full.</p>

<p>Season ticket holders eligible for more than one pass may make contributions on different days and at different price points until their maximum allocation has been completed or all passes are gone.</p>

<p>Season tickets holders with single seats, who are not eligible for a pass, may combine accounts by completing the transfer form available on HawaiiAthletics.com and mailing it to the UH Ticket Office by June 1.</p>

<p>All questions should be directed to the UH Ticket Office at 944-2697 or the ‘Ahahui Koa ‘Anuenue office at 956-6500.</p>

<p>Attendees at Kahala Mall&#8217;s Health and Wellness Fair will be able to sign up for wellness screenings by the University of Hawaii at Hilo College of Pharmacy from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 14. The screenings are free and open to the public.</p>

<p>Faculty and students will conduct diabetes and wellness education, asthma control awareness, blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose screening, and provide poison information. Fairgoers are also encouraged to bring their own prescription medications for a “brown bag” medication evaluation.</p>

<p>“This is the kind of experience that will prove to be invaluable to our students,” said Dr. Ron Taniguchi, the College of Pharmacy’s director of community partnerships. &#8220;It also allows the College of Pharmacy a chance to give back to the community by testing for medical conditions we know to be a problem for thousands of people in Hawaii.&#8221;</p>

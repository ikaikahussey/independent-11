<p>This month’s Bank of Hawaii Family Sunday takes visitors on a journey to 17th-century Europe. Inspired by the current textile exhibition <i>Men in Lace,</i> Bank of Hawaii Family Sunday coordinator Maikai Tubbs has created a program that highlights this historic fabric with the theme Whitewash. Kids and parents can try their hand at creating simple lace mesh from string with the help of University of Hawaii professor of apparel product design and merchandising Shu-Hwa Lin and Academy textile manager Sara Oka. </p>

<p>There’s lots for families to take in. Just as lace has evolved through out the ages, so has music. From Beethoven to the Beatles, learn about the classics of a variety of musical genres through an afternoon of fun and games with musical education group Do Re Mi Music. Kids can learn a simple waltz from the Hapa Haole Hula Girls and take part in musical chairs. Kids who come dressed as a famous person in history who wore lace can enter the Lace Costume Contest at noon. Those who don&#8217;t come clad in lace can visit the lace cart in the Men In Lace exhibition to try on lace ruffs, collars, and cuffs while baroque music plays in the background to give you the full effect. </p>

<p>Plus, <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End</i> will screen twice during the day at 11:10 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>When the family gets hungry, everyone can head to the Pavilion Café, which makes kid-friendly food such as hot dogs and sloppy joes just for Bank of Hawaii Family Sunday.</p>

<p>Visitors can enter the monthly drawing contest. The Academy gives contestants a theme and drawing supplies. The winner receives something new this month: a family level membership and his or her artwork is used to create the following month’s event brochure and is posted on the Academy website. Last month’s winner was fifteen-year-old Madeline St. John.</p>

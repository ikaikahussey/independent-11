<p>For the first time in six years, the public will have the opportunity to view the newly renovated 57,000-square-foot ground floor since a flash flood tore through it on October 30, 2004. </p>

<p>The newly reconstructed ground floor is the new home of the Government Documents and Maps Collections and Collections Services, MAGIS, and the Department of Information and Computer Science&#8217;s Library and Information Sciences program.</p>

<p>Tours of the ground floor and special collections will be available, as well as light snacks in the Sunny Alcove, bookmark takeaways, and items for sale in the Library Shop. A hotdog vendor will also be outside Hamilton’s front door for those who would like to grab a late lunch.</p>

<p>Visitors can view the Social Movements Collection exhibit in the Elevator Gallery and 100 Years of Hiking with the Hawaiian Trail and Mountain Club exhibit in the Bridge Gallery before the exhibits come down at the end of the month.</p>

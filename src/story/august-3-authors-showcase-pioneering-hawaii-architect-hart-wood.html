<p><i>Hart Wood: Architectural Regionalism in Hawaii</i> traces the life and work of Hart Wood (1880-1957), from his beginnings in architectural offices in Denver and San Francisco to his arrival in Hawaii in 1919 as a partner of C. W. Dickey and eventual solo career in the Islands. An outspoken leader in the development of a Hawaiian style of architecture, Wood incorporated local building traditions and materials in many of his projects and was the first in Hawaii to blend Eastern and Western architectural forms in a conscious manner. Enchanted by Hawaii’s vivid beauty and its benevolent climate, exotic flora, and cosmopolitan culture, Wood sought to capture the aura of the Islands in his architectural designs. Wood’s magnificent and graceful buildings remain critical to Hawaii’s architectural legacy more than 50 years after his death: the First Church of Christ Science on Punahou Street, the First Chinese Church on King Street, the S &amp; G Gump Building on Kalakaua Avenue, the Honolulu Board of Water Supply Administration Building on Beretania Street, and the Alexander &amp; Baldwin Building on Bishop Street, as well as numerous Wood residences throughout the city.</p>

<p>Don J. Hibbard administered the State of Hawaii’s historic preservation program from 1981 to 2002 and now works as a heritage specialist. He has written several books on Hawaii architecture, including <i>The View from Diamond Head</i> and <i>Designing Paradise</i>. </p>

<p>Glenn E. Mason, AIA, heads Mason Architects in Honolulu and has published several articles and essays on Hawaii’s historic architecture. Born and raised in Hawaii, Mason received an M. Arch. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1974 and then returned to Honolulu, where he has worked for 34 years in new construction as well as in his specialty, the preservation of historic buildings. Since 1978 he has guided thirteen successive phases of restoration of Iolani Palace. </p>

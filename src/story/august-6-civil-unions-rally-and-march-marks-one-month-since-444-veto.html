<p>On Wednesday, a federal judge found that no legitimate state interest justified treating gay and lesbian couples differently from others and that &#8220;moral disapproval&#8221; was not enough to save the voter-passed Proposition 8 in California, which prevented same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>One month ago in Hawaii, Gov. Linda Lingle vetoed House Bill 444, a bill that would have allowed same-sex couples to receive benefits equal to those of married opposite-sex couples. Lingle said her reason for vetoing HB444 was because she felt Hawaii&#8217;s voters should decide&#8212;despite the bill passing both the House and Senate.</p>

<p>On Friday, August 6, organizers of Honolulu&#8217;s LGBT Pride Parade are holding a rally and march in Downtown Honolulu to mark the one month anniversary of the HB444 veto.</p>

<p>Civil union supporters will gather at Chinatown Park, next to Hawaii Theater on the corner of Bethel and Hotel Streets, at 6:30 p.m. for a rally and sign holding.</p>

<p>A march through Downtown will then take place from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.</p>

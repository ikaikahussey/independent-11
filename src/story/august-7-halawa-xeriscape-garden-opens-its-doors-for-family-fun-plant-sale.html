<p>The Honolulu Board of Water Supply (BWS) and the Friends of Halawa Xeriscape Garden is hosting the 22nd annual open house and unthirsty plant sale at the Halawa Xeriscape Garden on Saturday, August 7 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (Early admission for members at 8:30 a.m.) Visitors should park along Iwaena or Iwaiwa Streets. A free shuttle will run along Iwaena Street from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.?</p>

<p>The event has been a summer tradition since 1989, promoting and educating the public about xeriscaping&#8212;a long-term way to conserve water through the landscape. Local nurseries will offer a variety of beautiful, unthirsty, and native plants at moderate prices. Proceeds will support educational programs and classes at the Halawa Xeriscape Garden.</p>

<p>In addition, the open house will include a full day of free, family-friendly activities such as Xeriscape workshops (composting, rain barrels, etc.), keiki games, keiki garden planting, a scavenger hunt in the three-acre demonstration garden, and a free mulch giveaway (visitors must bring their own containers).</p>

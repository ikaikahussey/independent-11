<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The third annual August Moon is a chance for people to try wines from 30 winemakers, sample light bites from top food venues and buy art&#8212;all to help bring arts education to Hawaii’s children.</p>

<p>The benefit, launched by The Contemporary Museum in 2009, is the first held by the newly joined Honolulu Academy of Arts and The Contemporary Museum.</p>

<p>The evening will again feature the live art event Drawn Out, which has some of Oahu’s top artists sit at a table and create works. Once completed, each work immediately goes on sale for $25. The event is a chance for aspiring art collectors to scoop up new art.</p>

<p>The event is also a special opportunity for wine enthusiasts. Every summer, Johnson Brothers of Hawaii selects a lineup of winemakers that it represents for a tour to allow industry insiders a taste of their products. August Moon allows the general public in on the wine action. People can try wines from four countries, with a focus on California. Along with Napa Valley selections such as Eagle Eye and Domaine Georg Rafael Père &amp; Fils, guests can try kosher wines from three different Israeli winemakers and fine ports from Portugal’s Kopke Ports.</p>

<p>Also on hand are light bites from restaurants and food businesses such as Town, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, and the museum’s own Pavilion Café.</p>

<p>The evening will also include a lucky-number drawing. Tickets are $25 each, and five for $100. Drawing items include a two-night stay in oceanfront rooms at the Sheraton Waikiki Resort, and a selection of premium wines.</p>

<p>Friends can make a party out of the event by purchasing tables for four or six people. Each table receives one complimentary bottle of wine. For table purchases, call (808) 532-3671.</p>

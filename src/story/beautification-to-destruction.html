<p>State crews this week are removing the bromeliad plants because they are known to have water pockets that are fertile breeding areas for the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. These destructive pests are the effective at spreading Dengue fever and haven&#8217;t been seen on Oahu since shortly after World War II. </p>

<p>The bromeliad plants were a part of a H-1 beautification project which cost $319,000 from the Department of Transportation fund. The DOT plans to move them and take better care of them by watering them regularly to end the breeding. </p>

<p>As for a possible replacement for the bromeliads, the state is considering a rock garden.</p>

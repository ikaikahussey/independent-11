<p>The <i>Cinema Italiano</i> festival is returning to Honolulu this weekend through September 26. Now in its seventh year, the <i>Cinema Italiano</i> festival shares the best in Italian cinema with Honolulu&#8217;s film lovers with an eye toward artistic merit, cultural relevance, and diversity. It represents a collaboration between the Friends of Italy Society of Hawaii, Kahala Mall, Consolidated Kahala Theatre, Kahala Resort and Ferrari/Maserati of Hawaii.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of particular note this year are two full-length features. <i>Slow Food</i> films, <i>Terra Madre</i>, and <i>Wind that Blows Around </i>are not to be missed. </p>

<p>Sponsored by Slow Foods Oahu and Whole Foods, one program features a documentary about <i>Terra Madre </i>(2006), exploring the spiritual, sensual, and intellectual connection people have with food.</p>

<p><i>The Wind that Blows Around </i>is a powerful film on the challenges of attaining sustainability in a small mountain community.</p>

<p>Can an airplane fly without wings? If it could, what would it look like? Would it look like a UFO (Unidentified Flying Object)? How would you make one?</p>

<p>A ball might travel a distance if you throw it, but it does not fly. To fly, an object must be carried by the air and not just fall to the earth. </p>

<p>So how can you make an airplane without wings?</p>

<p>To find out, come to Kaimuki Library on Sunday, October 17 at 2:00 p.m..</p>

<p>For kids in grades K-5.</p>

<p><i>The Kaimuki Library is located at 1041 Koko Head Avenue. For more information, call (808) 733-8425.</i></p>

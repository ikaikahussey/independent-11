<p>Public meetings will begin today on a revision to plans to build wind turbines on Molokai and Lanai, and to transmit that energy to Oahu via an undersea cable. The 400 kilowatt project, spearheaded by Hawaiian Electric Company, is not a done deal, with grassroots resistance on Lana‘i and Moloka‘i standing in the way of development. </p>

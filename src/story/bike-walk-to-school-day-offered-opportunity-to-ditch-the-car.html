<p>Honolulu&#8212;On Tuesday, May 18, Honolulu Waldorf School held its second annual Bike (&amp; Walk) to School Day. Approximately 150 people biked, walked, scootered, or skateboarded to school.&nbsp; Participating students received goodie bags with safety lights, and the fourth grade class, with a participation rate of 81percent, won a pizza lunch courtesy of Central Pacific Bank and Hawaii Bicycling League.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;This was part of the Bike Month celebration in Hawaii. Biking or walking is a great way for kids to start the day,&#8221; said Natalie Iwasa, aka Bicycle Mom.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Bike and Walk to School events work to create safer routes for bicycling and walking and emphasize the importance of issues such as increasing physical activity among children.&nbsp; In addition, they promote awareness that pedestrians and bicyclists are out on the road, reducing traffic congestion, and building connections between families, schools, and the broader community. </p>

<p>Supporters of the event include Hawaii Pedal Power and its sponsors: Jamba Juice, PATH Hawaii and Hawaii Bicycling League, Representatives Lyla Berg and Gene Ward, and Tammy Mori of the state Department of Transportation.</p>

<p>Waldorf&#8217;s next event will be International Walk to School Day on Wednesday, October 6.</p>

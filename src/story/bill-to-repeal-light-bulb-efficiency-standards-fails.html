<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A bill to repeal the law that increases the nation&#8217;s light bulb efficiency standards was defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives this week after failing to receive the necessary two-thirds vote in favor on Tuesday. House Republicans have threatened to re-introduce the measure through an appropriations bill this session.</p>

<p>Hawaii&#8217;s U.S. Representatives Mazie Hirono (D) and Colleen Hanabusa (D) voted against the measure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reps. Hirono and Hanabusa understand the need to reduce the burden of high energy bills for Hawaii residents,&#8221; said <a href="http://blueplanetfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Blue Planet Foundation</a> executive director Jeff Mikulina.</p>

<p>The standards, which call for light bulbs to be 25 to 30 percent more efficient beginning January 1, 2012, were set as part of the <a href="http://energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=IssueItems.Detail&amp;IssueItem_ID=f10ca3dd-fabd-4900-aa9d-c19de47df2da&amp;Month=12&amp;Year=2007" target="_blank">Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007</a> signed by President George W. Bush. The second phase of the act could increase bulb efficiency to 60 percent by 2020.</p>

<p>Opponents to these efficiency standards believe the law is effectively a ban on incandescent bulbs and an act of government overreach. The law sets standards on lighting technology, similar to existing standards for automobiles, refrigerators, air conditioners, and countless other devices.</p>

<p>The new efficiency standards could save Hawaii households nearly $150 a year by 2015. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates national consumer savings of $6 billion a year. The Natural Resources Defense Council calculated that consumers could save $12.5 billion by 2020.</p>

<p>According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, lighting consumes 19 percent of electricity used in the commercial and residential sectors.</p>

<p>“Energy efficiency is a critical component to achieving Hawaii’s clean energy goals,” says Mikulina. </p>

<p>Blue Planet Foundation has exchanged nearly 200,000 incandescent light bulbs for energy-efficient alternatives over the past two years, saving Hawaii residents about $25 million over the life of the bulbs in reduced energy use and preventing the consumption of more than 161,000 barrels of oil.</p>

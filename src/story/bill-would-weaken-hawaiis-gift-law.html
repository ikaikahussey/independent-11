<p>On Thursday March 31, the State House Judiciary Committee has scheduled decision-making on <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=671" target="_blank">Senate Bill 671</a>, which would create major exemptions to Hawaii&#8217;s gifts law. </p>

<p>The proposed House Draft 1 (HD1), discussed last week, would allow legislators and State employees to accept gifts from all 501(c) entities (including charities, advocacy groups, chambers of commerce, labor unions, and numerous other entities). It also allows acceptance of invitations (such as trips) from local, out-of-state, and even foreign governmental entities.</p>

<p>Common Cause Hawaii&#8217;s Nikki Love said, under the bill, legislators and State employees would be allowed to accept gifts even when it is obvious that the gift is intended to influence or reward their action. The HD1 requires disclosure of these gifts, but the reporting deadline is June 30&#8212;much too late for the public to keep an eye on gifts accepted during the legislative session, Love said.</p>

<p>HALEIWA&#8212;The arrival of a new west, northwest swell is expected to see the Billabong Pipeline Masters resume Wednesday December 15.</p>

<p>&#8220;The surf will increase over Wednesday afternoon and into Thursday, with head high to occasional overhead sets, as new west, northwest and north swells move in and top out,&#8221; said <a href="http://Surfline.com" title="Surfline.com">Surfline.com</a> forecaster Kevin Wallis. &#8220;Conditions look good during that time as well with light wind.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The most likely scenario is that the contest will get underway Wednesday morning as the new swell fills in and continues to a finish on Thursday, when the peak of the swell will arrive. </p>

<p>When competition gets underway, the question of the hour will be if Joel Parkinson can win his third round heat and become only the second person in history to win a &#8220;Triple-Triple&#8221;&#8212;three consecutive Vans Triple Crown titles. Parkinson leads the ratings with a huge comeback after a severe injury to his foot kept him out of the 2010 ASP Pro Tour season. </p>

<p>Ten-time world champion Kelly Slater will also enter the fray at round three stage. </p>

<p>The women&#8217;s Vans Duel for the Jewel&#8212;a one-heat duel for the $10,000 women&#8217;s Triple Crown title between Tyler Wright (AUS), Stephanie Gilmore (AUS), Coco Ho (HAW), and Alana Blanchard (HAW), is also scheduled to run tomorrow, surf permitting.</p>

<p>MOILIILI&#8212;Honolulu ska band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blacksquareband" target="_blank">Black Square</a> celebrates the release of its fourth, self-titled album with a CD release party at Anna’s on Friday June 17. In true indie fashion, the band recorded, produced, and will distribute the record on its own, without the assistance of a record label.</p>

<p>“We actually debated whether or not to print CD’s,” says Serena Hashimoto, the band’s manager. She also co-produced the record. “We seriously considered going only digital.”</p>

<p>As the music industry changes inexorably toward the digital format, more and more bands around the world are eschewing physical production and opting to keep their music in digital form only. But Black Square decided to print copies of their latest work, and have manufactured a limited run in CD format. A special edition of the CD will be available only at Friday’s show.</p>

<p>Black Square has been selected to perform on the <a href="http://vanswarpedtour.com/" target="_blank">2011 Vans Warped Tour</a>, the iconic alternative music festival that tours the United States over the summer. Beginning in Orlando, Florida, the band will play a series of shows ending in Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>Joining Black Square to celebrate the release will be the bands Megum Siffering, Raised by Wolves, Narwhal, and Upstanding Youth. </p>

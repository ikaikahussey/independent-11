<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Nope, that&#8217;s no circus. The Neal S. Blaisdell Center Concert Hall is being “tented”&#8212;covered with sealing tarps&#8212;and fumigated today to eliminate termites and other pests.</p>

<p>The work, valued at $125,000, is being performed by Kamaaina Termite and Pest Control at no cost to the City.</p>

<p>The sealing tarps are being installed throughout the day, and fumigation is scheduled to begin in the early evening. No one will be admitted to the building until the work is completed.</p>

<p>The building will remain covered with sealing tarps for several days, and will remain closed for cleanup until late next week.</p>

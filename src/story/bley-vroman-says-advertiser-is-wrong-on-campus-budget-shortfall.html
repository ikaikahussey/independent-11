<p>On Tuesday, October 7, the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa administration held a &#8220;Campus-wide Conversation&#8221; at Kuykendall Auditorium that focused on an informational briefing on the University budget, past, present and future. The meeting drew a packed house of students, faculty, staff, alumni and other members of the community. Vice Chancellor for Administration, Finance and Operations Kathy Cutshaw and newly appointed interim Chancellor Robert Bley-Vroman fielded questions, took suggestions and listened as some voiced continuing concerns over the future of the system&#8217;s flagship campus.</p>

<p>The Chancellor sent out an email thanking all the participants for showing up or streaming the conversation live. In his email, the Chancellor also says that the front-page article in today&#8217;s <em>Star-Advertiser</em> &#8220;UH-Manoa to be $31M in the red,&#8221; is factually incorrect in its headline and second paragraph, which states, &#8220;Manoa officials are projecting a $31 million deficit for the fiscal year that ends June 30, despite efforts to curb spending.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;As we clearly pointed out in the presentation on Tuesday, we do not expect a negative bottom line in fiscal year 2015 and, in fact, are working very hard to deal with a shifting funding landscape in which public funding and other revenue sources are falling faster than tuition dollars,&#8221; said Bley-Vroman.</p>

<p>Both Bley-Vroman and Cutshaw will visit the Mānoa Faculty Senate during its next meeting on Wednesday, October 15, according to the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/uhmfs/minutes/2014_15/sen_agenda_20141015.html">agenda</a>, presumably to continue conversations about the budget situation and hiring freeze.</p>

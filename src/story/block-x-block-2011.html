<p>I&#8217;m writing this post from the Block by Block Community News Summit 2011, at Loyola University in Chicago. It&#8217;s the second year of this conference, bringing together 200 hyperlocal, local, and regional digital news publishers from throughout the U.S. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here in Chicagoland, with such a talented and passionate group of news innovators.</p>

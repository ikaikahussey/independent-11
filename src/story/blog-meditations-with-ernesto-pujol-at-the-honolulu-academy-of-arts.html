<p>It&#8217;s 2:36 p.m. My mind is unusually clear on a Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>I just spent an hour or so observing Ernesto Pujol&#8217;s &#8220;Speaking in Silence&#8221; performance at the Honolulu Academy of Arts site.</p>

<p>I had two cups of coffee and cream of mushroom soup from the cafe.</p>

<p>Across the from the cafe, the acclaimed New York performance artist took silent steps behind pillars and sculptures in the museum&#8217;s Pavillion Courtyard.</p>

<p>Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Step. Turn.</p>

<p>Pujol is dressed in red pants and a red shirt. The soles of his feet are black from pacing back and forth since 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>As other patrons chat and enjoy their lunch at the cafe, it at first begins to feel like I&#8217;m watching a caged animal at a zoo. Pacing.</p>

<p>I remember hearing that observers should feel the flow of the meditative public art performance.</p>

<p>So I pay close attention to the sounds. Birds chirping. People chirping.</p>

<p>I pay close attention to Pujol&#8217;s surroundings and wonder why he chose this specific area. From my vantage point, he disappears and reappears like a ghost between the sculptures and the pillars.</p>

<p>I start to wonder if there&#8217;s some message about art and artists, how they might be perceived as one and the same&#8212;weaved seamlessly together.</p>

<p>I also wonder if he&#8217;s saying something about people&#8217;s purposes not being apparent to others who don&#8217;t take the time to see them.</p>

<p>People of all ages at the museum look on, some for a moment, others for a few minutes, and move on. A little boy in a red striped shirt is captivated by Pujol and thinks about getting closer. But he doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I wonder if it&#8217;s okay to go up and talk to him. I imagine how thirsty or tired he might be.</p>

<p>Two cups of coffee and a bowl of soup later, however, and it&#8217;s time for me to go.</p>

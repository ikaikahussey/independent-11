<p>HONOLULU &#8212; On Saturday, July 9, the Ethnic Studies Student Association at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thenightmarchers" target="_blank">The Night Marchers</a> will host the <a href="http://bluescholars.com/blog/" target="_blank">Blue Scholars</a> live in Hawai‘i, as they perform tracks from their new highly anticipated LP, C<em>inémetropolis</em>, at The Loft in Chinatown.</p>

<p>This concert marks the third visit to the islands for the dynamic, Seattle-based, hip hop duo comprised of Geo, the MC, and Sabzi, the DJ/Producer.&nbsp; Their new album, <em>Cinémetropolis</em>, has been described as a “visual soundtrack,” and exemplifies their growth and maturity through its soulful beats and engaging lyrics.</p>

<p>Opening for Blue Scholars is LA-based artist, <a href="http://www.bambu.la/" target="_blank">Bambu</a>, who is coming off of his “Smugglers Tour.”&nbsp; In addition, a number of local hip hop acts will be joining Bambu to open up the concert.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Geo, Sabzi and Bambu will be participating in a three-day “talk story” event at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, prior to the July 9th concert.&nbsp; Entitled “Rise Up! Represent!” the “talk story” will focus on student leadership and community organizing.</p>

<p>ESSA is a student organization from multidisciplinary backgrounds that works in collaboration with the Ethnic Studies (ES) Department at the University of Hawai‛i at Mānoa.&nbsp; ESSA also functions independently to bring enjoyable, social activities and events that allow students and the community to interact with and engage in a dialogue about culture, identity, and socio-political issues that are explored in ES courses and in everyday life.</p>

<p>The Night Marchers is a collective of Hawaii rappers striving to master the art of the emcee. On a daily basis, the collective spends their time marching to various cyphers all over the island and making good music for Hawaii&#8217;s “hip-hop heads.”</p>

<p>President Obama recently announced <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-will-propose-vast-expansion-of-pacific-ocean-marine-sanctuary/2014/06/16/f8689972-f0c6-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.html">plans to expand</a> the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument from 87,000 square miles to nearly 782,000 square miles. Despite the media framing this move as a victory for ocean conservation, the truth is that these monuments will further colonize, militarize and privatize the Pacific. </p>

<p>Many mistakenly refer to marine &#8220;monuments&#8221; as &#8220;sanctuaries&#8221; because they are both &#8220;marine protected areas.&#8221; However, an official sanctuary is designated by the Secretary of Commerce under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, which <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/marine-monument.html">requires</a> &#8220;extensive public process, local community engagement, stakeholder involvement, and citizen participation, both prior to and following designation.&#8221;&nbsp; On the other hand, the President unilaterally designates marine monuments through the Antiquities Act of 1906. No public process is required. </p>

<p>The first and largest Marine National Monument was established in 2006: The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (140,000 square miles). Three more marine monuments were established in 2009: The Marianas Trench Marine National Monument (95,000 square miles); The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (87,000 square miles); and The Rose Atoll Marine National Monument (13,000 square miles). The <a href="http://www.fws.gov/marinenationalmonuments/">total &#8220;protected&#8221; area</a>, with Obama&#8217;s expansion, would be more than a million square miles of &#8220;small islands, atolls, coral reefs, submerged lands, and deep blue waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why has this antiquited, unilateral process suddenly become so popular? Why are U.S. presidents from both sides of the political divide side-stepping Congressional approval and—more importantly—public participation and scrutiny? </p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that establishing a marine national monument, reserve, or refuge places our coastal and open ocean waters under federal control. The marine monuments are administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (under the Department of Commerce) or by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (under the Department of the Interior). This ocean and submerged land grab by the federal government severely limits public access and trust. Additionally, these monuments <a href="http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/unesco-dishonoring-indigenous-rights">violate the rights</a> of indigenous peoples by separating us from our sacred spaces. Traditional fishing grounds or ritual spaces may no longer be accessible. If there are exceptions for indigenous rites, we will need to apply for a permit and receive federal approval. </p>

<p><strong>How Do Marine Reserves Militarize the Ocean? </strong></p>

<p>As I wrote about in a <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/u.s.-military-r-r-rape-removal-in-guahan">previous editorial</a>, the U.S. military removed the original landowners of Litekyan (Ritidian), an area in northern Guam, under eminent domain in 1963, and the Navy used the area as a communications station during the Cold War. Thirty years later, 1,000 acres of the land was deemed “excess.” Instead of that land being returned to the families, it was transferred to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and designated a &#8220;National Wildlife Refuge.&#8221; Today, four thousand acres of Litekyan is now being considered for a live firing range complex.</p>

<p>You see, designating land and water as a monument, refuge, reserve, or even sanctuary keeps the land under federal control as opposed to public (and indigenous) trust. So if the military ever wants to use the land in the future, it can simply be converted (or re-converted in the case of Litekyan) from the Department of the Interior or Commerce to the Department of Defense. This is the &#8220;<a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/beyond-the-environment-obamas-big-pacific-ocean-move-10694">logic of military conservation</a>.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
Many marine monuments house strategic military bases. For example, the marine monuments of the Pacific are home to U.S. bases on Guam, Tinian, Saipan, Rota, Farallon de Medinilla, Wake Island and Johnston Island, <a href="http://fpif.org/environmental_protectionof_bases/">to name a few</a>. The reason why military bases can be within marine monuments is because &#8220;nothing in the proclamations impairs or otherwise affects the activities of the Department of Defense. Among other things, the DoD is ensured full freedom of navigation in accordance with the law of the sea, and the U.S. Navy can continue effective training to maintain its antisubmarine warfare and other capabilities.&#8221; In other words, the military is <em><a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0901/S00093.htm">exempt</a></em> from most environmental regulations and prohibitions. </p>

<p>Ironically, the public may no longer be allowed to fish in these &#8220;protected&#8221; areas because it might affect the fragile ocean ecosystem, yet the military can conduct weapons training and testing. Remember, marine monuments are not designed to protect the ocean from the U.S. military, one of the worst polluters in the world. In fact the opposite is true: they are designed to allow easier military access. As activists in Hawai&#8217;i know, these national monuments could become &#8220;<a href="http://honoluluweekly.com/cover/2008/03/national-monument-watery-grave/">watery graves</a>&#8221; for endangered species when military training occurs. </p>

<p>Besides providing more federally controlled space for the U.S. military to train, marine monuments give military bases another layer of secrecy from the public. This buffer strategy is spreading to other nations. During the meeting of the U.S. State Department sponsored <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140617-pacific-marine-reserves-ocean-environment/">Our Ocean conference</a> last week in Washington DC, other countries announced similar plans to federalize massive ocean areas, including Palau, Kiribati, the Cook Islands and the Bahamas. These new marine reserves will become military sanctuaries, buffer zones and watery bases for the U.S. military as it forcefully positions itself in the Asia-Pacific region (and uses &#8220;illegal fishing&#8221; as justification to militarize these marine reserves). <br />
 <br />
We need to be critical of these efforts. Read about what happened to the <a href="http://truth-out.org/news/item/23729-militarization-of-the-mesoamerican-barrier-reef-harms-indigenous-communities">Cayos Cochinos</a>, an island group in the Carribean off Honduras, during the twenty years after they were declared a &#8220;protected area.&#8221; The Afro-Indigenous Garifuna peoples have been displaced from their lands and fishing grounds. Tourism developers and other private industries have invested in and exploited the islands. And, you guessed it, the U.S. military is using the area for basing and training, providing millions of dollars of aid to the Honduras government. This is what will happen to countries that ally with the U.S. in this colonial conservation scheme.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In 2009, Britian designated a marine protected area around the Chagos islands. However, the waters around the island of Diego Garcia, which is the site of one of the most secretive overseas U.S. military bases, was exempted. How bizarre: a secretive U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean surrounded by a 200-mile marine preserve controlled by the British government. Peter Sand, in &#8220;<a href="http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/ceesp/ceesp_publications/?6551/">The Chagos Archipelago: Footprint of Empire, or World Heritage?</a>&#8221;, pointedly asks whether these new marine reserves are &#8220;an anachronistic example of &#8216;environmental imperialism&#8217;, or evidence of an equally outdated variant of &#8216;fortress conservation&#8217; that disregards human rights under the noble guise of nature protection.&#8221; Either way, the Chagossians who were removed from their islands may never be able to return.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>How do Private Corporations Benefit from Marine Monuments? </strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned before, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is under the Department of Commerce (DOC). Does that seem strange to you? It certainly seems strange to Obama, when he joked during his 2011 State of the Union address: “The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they’re in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they’re in saltwater.” Obama wants to <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/204039-white-house-plan-would-move-noaa-to-interior-">move NOAA</a> to the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>Joking aside, it actually makes perfect (or perverse) sense that NOAA remains in DOC, which promotes trade and economic development. A few years ago, then Secretary-of-State Hillary Clinton dubbed the 21st century: &#8220;<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/11/americas_pacific_century">America&#8217;s Pacific Century</a>.&#8221; This strategic turn aims to expand trade, investment, and militarization throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The cornerstone of America&#8217;s Pacific Century is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a free trade agreement that has been <a href="http://prospect.org/article/stealth-attack-democratic-governance">described</a> as &#8220;NAFTA on steroids.&#8221; As Clinton stated, the continued economic growth of the region depends on the &#8220;security and stability that has long been guaranteed by the U.S. military.&#8221; It is not surprising that TPP negotiations, as well as militarization proposals in the Pacific, intensified around the same time that President Bush designated the first marine monument in 2006.</p>

<p>So what are these economic opportunities, and what does the TPP have to do with the surge of marine national monuments and reserves designated by the U.S. federal government and its allies? </p>

<p>First, the more military sanctuaries the U.S. has around the world, the more federal tax money will be spent to secure these areas for investment, which means more profit for the military industrial complex and private defense firms. </p>

<p>Second, does something smell fishy? The justification for many of these marine reserves is to prevent illegal fishing and fish fraud, especially from China. With a massive fleet of 2,000 distant-water, state-subsidized fishing vessels, China catches nearly five tons of fish a year, worth more than $10 billion—<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-19/china-s-illegal-fishing-expeditions-threaten-world-waters">some legally and some illegally</a>. In contrast, nearly 90 percent of seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported. By establishing marine monuments, and encouraging its allies in the Pacific to do the same, the U.S. could effectively shut out China from Pacific tuna waters. In turn, private U.S. tuna corporations could negotiate contracts with Pacific allied nations to develop Pacific fisheries or to obtain exclusive fishing rights within the marine reserves (as well as access to cheap labor and canneries). This comes at a time when foreign-owned and American-owned canned-tuna companies are <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303743604579352793666178318">battling for control</a> over our kids&#8217; school lunches. Billions of dollars of tuna are on the plate. </p>

<p>Third, wherever you find a national monument, you will find a tourism industry. The Cayos Cochinos is a prime example. The government that controls the marine monument can permit private companies to operate tourism centers, hotels, eco-adventures—all in the name of development and jobs. The concessions throughout the U.S. National Park Service are owned and operated by private companies, which gross over <a href="http://www.concessions.nps.gov/">$1 billion annually</a>. There are more than <a href="http://www.concessions.nps.gov/concessioners.htm">500 companies</a>, from food to lodging to adventure sports to retail, that have contracts with the National Parks. Of course, the entire National Park system was one way of displacing Native American presence on these lands. </p>

<p>Fourth, the Pacific has long been a &#8220;laboratory&#8221; for Western science and technology. Since another justification for marine reserves is scientific research, then we will see many more <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/2014/06/uh-receives-unprecedented-40m-grant-for-oceanography-research/">unprecedented grants</a> for oceanography research. This research can be transformed into profit by private industries, such as deep-sea mining, geo-thermal energy, open-ocean (genetically modified) aquaculture, and pharmaceutical drugs derived from ocean <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140122153611.htm">microbial bacteria</a>. </p>

<p>New Zealand established a Marine Mammal Sanctuary in 2008 to protect engangered dolphins, yet it is now considering <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10171432/Mauis-dolphin-sanctuary-in-oil-drilling-move-Greens">opening the area up for oil drilling</a>. This is not a contradiction; this is exactly what these conservation schemes are designed for.</p>

<p>Lastly, do you want to see Avatar 2 with me when it comes out? In 2012, James Cameron <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/26/mariana-trench-james-cameron-mission">dived in a submarine</a> to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest point on earth, which is protected by the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument. He lit up the trench with an eight-foot tower of LED lighting to film 3D footage. In another celebrity sighting, Leonardo DiCaprio <a href="http://time.com/2890285/leonardo-dicaprio-state-department-ocean-conservation/">made a cameo</a> at the State Department&#8217;s Our Ocean conference, donating $7 milllion towards marine reserves. Apparently, he&#8217;s a diving enthusiast. </p>

<p><strong>What is Blue-Washing? </strong></p>

<p>In the 21st century, national marine momunents, marine parks, marine preserves, marine refuges, marine sanctuaries and their other iterations are instruments that empower the federal government to take land and water away from indigenous and public access, scrutiny, and trust. The &#8220;marine monuments&#8221; are especially dangerous because they do not require—nor are they accountable to—legislative or public comment, engagement, or approval. </p>

<p>As David Vine, in &#8220;<a href="http://fpif.org/environmental_protectionof_bases/">Environmental Protection of Bases</a>,&#8221; notes: &#8220;For all the benefits that marine protection areas might bring, governments are using environmentalism as a cover to protect the long-term life of environmentally harmful bases. The designation also helps governments hold onto strategic territories.&#8221; Furthermore, these designations give the governments of the U.S. and its neoliberal allies the power to create contracts with private corporations to exploit the resources of our ocean for profit and not for the public good. Let&#8217;s call this a form of &#8220;<a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/reports/bluewashing/">Blue-washing</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word &#8220;monument&#8221; comes from the Latin, <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=monument">monumentum</a>, meaning &#8220;grave&#8221; or &#8220;memorial.&#8221; If our oceans continue to become national marine monuments, our blue ocean will indeed become a watery grave, a memorial to the beauty, richness, and biodiversity that once was.</p>

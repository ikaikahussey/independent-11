<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Bluegrass sensation <a href="http://rhondavincent.com/" target="_blank">Rhonda Vincent and The Rage</a> will perform Sunday, August 14 at the McKinley High School Auditorium, with Honolulu’s own bluegrass heroes Saloon Pilots opening the show. Born into a musical family in Missouri, Vincent has risen to stardom in the bluegrass world. </p>

<p>After a tepid career in mainstream country music, Vincent reconnected with her bluegrass roots in 2000 with the release of <em>Back Home Again</em>. Since then, the singer has found chart-topping success, and was selected Female Vocalist of the Year for seven consecutive years between 2000 and 2006 by the International Bluegrass Music Association. Rhonda Vincent and the Rage has also won the coveted Entertainer of the Year. She’s been crowned the “new queen of bluegrass” by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>

<p>Vincent produced her latest release, <em>Taken</em>, in her own studio, working closely with her longtime supporting band. That allowed her the freedom to craft her playing to the point that she played all of the mandolin heard on the record.</p>

<p>Children under 18 accompanied by an adult will be admitted to the concert for $1. Bluegrass Hawaii members will receive a discount.</p>

<p>HALAWA&#8212;The Honolulu Board of Water Supply is offering a pumpkin planting and harvesting workshop on Saturday, July 9 at the Halawa Xeriscape Garden. Open to the public, the workshop will allow participants to plant their own pumpkin, and harvest it in time for Halloween on Saturday, October 29.</p>

<p>Pumpkins are low water use plants. The workshop will discuss the pumpkin’s life cycle and its “unthirsty” or xeriscape characteristics, complete a pumpkin fun workbook, and enjoy a lively storytelling session. Participants will also have the opportunity to plant pumpkin seeds on “Pumpkin Hill.” </p>

<p>Located in Halawa Valley, the Halawa Xeriscape Garden offers educational tours to the public, providing information on plants and practices that conserve water in gardening and landscaping. </p>

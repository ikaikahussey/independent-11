<p>HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;Sen. Gilbert Kahele (District 2&#8212;D) will be hosting another education forum, featuring Hawaii County’s State Board of Education (BOE) Vice-Chairman, Brian De Lima, on Friday, December 2 from 5:30 p.m. at the Waiakea High School Cafeteria (155 W. Kawili Street). </p>

<p>De Lima is among board nine members appointed by the Governor to the newly formed BOE earlier this year. De Lima will give an update on the BOE&#8217;s current issues and take part in a question and answer session with the audience.</p>

<p>“This forum is an opportunity for constituents to express their concerns regarding issues surrounding our state education system,” Kahele said.</p>

<p>Act 5, which was signed into law by the governor on March 14, gives the governor the authority to appoint nine members, which would consist of: One member from the County of Hawaii, one member from the County of Maui, one member from the County of Kauai, three members from the City and County of Honolulu, and three at-large-members; provided that the governor select an at-large member as the chairperson. </p>

<p>Voters in the 2010 General Election approved a constitutional amendment calling for an appointed, rather than elected, Board of Education.</p>

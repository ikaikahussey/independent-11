POHOIKI&#8212;Earlier this week, <i>Youth News for The Hawaii Independent</i> initially went to Pohoiki to cover a scheduled event for autistic keiki that surf at the Boogie Kalama Surf Contest. That event however was cancelled.</p>

<p>Instead, <i>Youth News</i> interviewed surfers such as Mikey Hensley, Ikaika Kalama, as well as Ulu, Kiko, Tristi, and Manu Napeahi, children of Claire and Rex Napeahi. We asked the frequent Pohoiki surfers how long they&#8217;ve been surfing.</p>

<p>Ulu Napeahi, who is the youngest surfer we interviewed at 13, has been riding waves since he was four years old. Napeahi said he learned to surf from his best friend, Godfrey, at Richardson’s Bay. </p>

<p>Mikey Hensley, 18, said he has been surfing since he was 12 years old. A contestant in many surf and body boarding competitions, Hensley has already won a several awards for body boarding and made it to the finals in surfing. </p>

<p>We also interviewed professional surfer Ikaika Kalama, 30, who has been surfing for 20 years. “Pohoiki is my home,” Kalama said despite currently living on the North Shore of Oahu.</p>

<p><i>Youth News also spoke with siblings Manu Napeahi, 14, and Tristi Napeahi, 20, who reside in Kalapana and have both been going to Pohoiki basically all their lives. Their brother, Kiko, who is now 17 also surfs down Pohoiki. “We love it here”, say the Napeahi Family.</p>

<p>The waves were a bit choppy and high level winds blew throughout Pohoiki. There were lots of families camping and enjoying the sunshine&#8212;including some uncles who were throwing net at First Bay.</p>

<p>The kick-off for the Ninth Annual Boogie Kalama Surf Meet continues through the weekend, look for more reporting on Tuesday.</p>

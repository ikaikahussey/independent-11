<p>HONOLULU&#8212;As part of September’s National Preparedness Month, a “Get Ready Ewa Beach” Emergency Preparedness Fair is scheduled for September 24 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Ewa Makai Middle School in Ewa Beach. The event will focus on tsunami and hurricane preparedness, how to create a family plan, supply kits, evacuations, health emergencies and insurance.</p>

<p>Experts from the Department of Emergency Management, State Civil Defense, FEMA, American Red Cross, Boy Scouts of America, and dozens of other organizations have been invited to host informational booths, seminars, and training sessions.</p>

<p>Organizations are still invited to host a booth at the fair.</p>

<p>“The HECO power outage and tsunami in March helped us to realize that our community is not prepared for these kinds of disasters,” said Rep. Kymberly Pine (R), who represents Ewa Beach, Iroquois Point, and Puuloa. “Our residents have taken action to change this by putting on this event.”</p>

<p>The family-friendly fair will be open to all ages and include fun activities for children as well as preparedness information specifically geared toward older residents.</p>

<p>The event has been organized by Pine and the Ewa Emergency Preparedness Committee (Ewa EPC), an organization of local residents with extensive preparedness experience.&nbsp; </p>

<p><i>For more information or to inquire about hosting a booth, call Donald Harlor at (808) 683-3388.</i></p>

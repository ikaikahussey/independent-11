<p><i>&#8220;Grab some bait and a fishing pole and ... let&#8217;s go fishing today ...&#8221;</i></p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;State marine waters opened to the new fishing year for bottomfish on Wednesday, September 1.</p>

<p>The fishing year was closed earlier this year on April 20 and remained closed until August 31. Seven bottomfish species were affected by this closure: onaga, ehu, opakapaka, kalekale, gindai, lehi, and the hapuupuu.</p>

<p>The proposed total allowable catch (TAC) for the new fishing year is 254,050 pounds of Deep 7 bottomfish. The TAC is monitored through commercial landings. The bottomfish fishery will close when the 2010-2011 commercial landings reach the TAC limit, or on August 31, 2011 when the fishing year ends, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) also reminds bottomfish fishers that the State’s twelve bottomfish restricted fishing areas will continue to remain closed to bottomfish fishing.</p>

<p>Fishers are advised to consult the Department’s website for the locations of the twelve restricted fishing areas.</p>

<p>All other existing State rules for bottomfish and fishing for bottomfish remain applicable. </p>

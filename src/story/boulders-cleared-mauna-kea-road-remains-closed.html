<p>The boulders and rock structures that were found on the gravel road leading to the summit of Mauna Kea have been removed. The Office of Mauna Kea Management (OMKM) worked collaboratively with volunteers to ensure the rocks were safely and properly cleared from the roadway. The state continues to assess and monitor the situation to ensure the safety of the people on Mauna Kea.<br />
 <br />
The road has been temporarily closed until further notice. The Mauna Kea Comprehensive Management Plan authorizes the University of Hawaiâ€˜i to close the road in the event of hazardous conditions and emergencies.<br />
 <br />
Questions regarding the grading of the road leading to the summit have also been raised during this time. It is routine practice for OMKM to conduct regular road gradings twice a week to ensure the safety and integrity of the road.<br />
 <br />
The Mauna Kea Visitors Center is also closed until further notice.<br />
 <br />
Look for notices from OMKM on the status of the access road to Mauna Kea and the Mauna Kea Visitors Center.</p>

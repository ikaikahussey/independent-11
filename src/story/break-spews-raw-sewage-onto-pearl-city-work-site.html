<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Department of Environmental Services responded this morning to a ruptured force main caused by a third party contractor.</p>

<p>ENV received the call at 9:00 a.m., arrived at 9:30 a.m., and contained the spill at 11:45 a.m.</p>

<p>Hawaiian Dredging, who was doing repair work for the City on the 42-inch Pearl City force main that broke late last week, accidentally hit the adjacent 30-inch backup force main, which is located near the 14th hole on Ted Makalena Golf Course. </p>

<p>ENV dispatched more than 10 vactor trucks to the site. Approximately 7,000 gallons of untreated wastewater made its way into a drainage canal that eventually leads to Middle Loch in Pearl Harbor. Vactor trucks recovered 96,000 gallons and deposited it back into the collection system near the Waipahu Pump Station, while 5,000 gallons dissipated into the ground.</p>

<p>ENV notified the State Department of Health and the U.S. Navy. Signs have been posted and water sampling is underway. The affected area has been cleaned, disinfected and deodorized.</p>

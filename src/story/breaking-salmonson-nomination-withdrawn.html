<p>The <em>Hawaii Independent</em> has learned that the nomination for Genevieve Salmonson, the current interim director of the Office of Environmental Quality Control (OEQC), to the full position has been withdrawn by Governor Abercrombie.</p>

<p>The Senate committee on Energy and the Environment (chair: Gabbard, vice-chair: Ruderman) was scheduled to hear Salmonson&#8217;s nomination tomorrow, but Chair Gabbard sent a <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/splsession2013b/HEARING%20ENE%2010-29-13.pdf">notice</a> to committee members at approximately 7pm tonight notifying them that the governor has withdrawn her nomination.</p>

<p>Salmonson&#8217;s nomination was controversial because of her <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/rotunda/salmonson-nomination-will-go-to-hearing-during-special-session">track record</a> as OEQC Director under the Lingle and Cayetano administrations and drew <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/rotunda/environmental-groups-oppose-salmonson-nomination">criticism</a> from nine separate environmental groups.</p>

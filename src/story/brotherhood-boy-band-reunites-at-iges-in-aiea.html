<p>AIEA&#8212;In the late-90’s, Darryl “Cuz” Anguay produced a local boy band called Brotherhood, who found success with hits such as “Be My Girl” and “Send a Message.” Their popularity led them to open for such national acts as Boyz II Men and New Kids on the Block.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When Brotherhood disbanded, some of the members joined some of the guys from The New Generation (TNG) to form Faceless and then Brownskin. Faceless and Brownskin opened for K-Ci &amp; Jojo, Christina Aguilera, and Ginuwine, and also worked with local artists Fiji, “Princess” Ilona Irvine, and Jamin “Chief Ragga” Wong. </p>

<p>The group performs at <a href="http://www.igesrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Ige&#8217;s Restaurant</a> in Aiea on Friday, June 19.</p>

<p>In 2011, brothers Michael and Richie Pelen from the original Brotherhood have reunited the group, and they are currently in the studio and performing. Joining them are accomplished singer/songwriter Dino Robley and Devin Nakasone, charismatic frontman from the groups Chaos and All Left.</p>

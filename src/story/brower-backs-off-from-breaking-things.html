<p>Brower today in the Star-Advertiser:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to put down the sledgehammer. The point that I was trying to make has been made,&#8221; Brower (D-Ala Moana, Waikiki) told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser today. &#8220;Now that the issue of shopping carts is on our minds, the question is are we going to move forward and try to solve it or just let it become status quo.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the 2013 Legislative Session, dozens of bills from both the house and senate were introduced regarding housing and the homeless. Of these bills, 15 made it to a roll-call vote and were passed on to the governor&#8217;s office where they all became law.</p>

<p>Rep. Tom Brower, who managed to attract <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/18/tom-brower-hawaii_n_4299256.html">national attention</a> and garnered his own locally trending hashtag on Twitter (#BrowerShouldSmash) for his sledgehammer-wielding vigilantism (see cartoon, above), voted &#8216;yes&#8217; on all 15 bills.

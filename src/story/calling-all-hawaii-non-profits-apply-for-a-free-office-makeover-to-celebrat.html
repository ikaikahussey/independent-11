<p>HONOLULU&#8212;January is National Get Organized Month, which reminds folks about the benefits of getting and staying organized, including having the right organizing “tools” and working with a professional organizer. To celebrate this annual event, the members of the Hawaii Association of Professional Organizers (HAPO, Inc.) are donating their time and services towards an office makeover to a nonprofit/charity organization of their choosing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Interested nonprofit candidates that wish to be considered for this opportunity to streamline their operations, maximize efficiency, and improve their overall workday can obtain an application at <a href="www.hapoonline.org" title="www.hapoonline.org">www.hapoonline.org</a>. You must act quickly, though. The deadline for completed applications is December 27, 2010.</p>

<p>In January 2011, HAPO will select the winning non-profit organization, send a team of professional organizers to their office, create an organizing plan, and spend one day working with staff to makeover the office in preparation for the new year. The hope is that a more organized office environment will benefit both the staff and the cause it serves.</p>

<p>Retailers, distributors, and manufacturers of organizing products and services are also invited to participate by contributing products and/or services to the event. Sponsorship opportunites are also available. <br />
 <br />
Get Organized Month, sponsored by the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO), is a national industry-wide event aimed at raising awareness of the benefits of getting organized and hiring a professional organizer. </p>

<p>“Getting organized is one of the top New Year’s resolutions people make,” says NAPO Past President, Standolyn Robertson. </p>

<p>During Get Organized Month, NAPO’s chapters and members will hold public events offering de-cluttering tips and filing methods throughout the country. Some events include reuse-and-recycle programs, organizing services, shred-a-thons, seminars, school outreaches and contests. Programming will take place in local libraries, bookstores and community centers nationwide. </p>

<p>Whether an individual, business, or organization, everyone can benefit from the increased order, decreased stress, and greater effectiveness that results from getting organized and working with professional organizers. </p>

<p><i>Applications are available to interested nonprofits at <a href="http://www.hapoonline.org" title="www.hapoonline.org">www.hapoonline.org</a>, where donors too, can learn more about how to participate.

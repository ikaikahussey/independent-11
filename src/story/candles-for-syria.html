<p>A candlelit vigil against a US attack on Syria, organized by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MoveonHonolulu">MoveOn.org Honolulu</a>, gathered along Kilauea Avenue in Kahala Monday evening.</p>

<p>Researcher Shigeo Niyake, from Japan, heard about the vigil from his sister, who resides in Honolulu. Mr. Niyake said that he is disheartened that Japanese Prime Minister Abe is supporting US President Obama&#8217;s call for an attack on Syria.</p>

<p>&#8220;My parents are from Hiroshima, so I am an advocate for peace,&#8221; Mr. Niyake said.</p>

<p>Jay Evans, from Moiliili, said, &#8220;Hawaii is so apolitical, someone has to get out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Congress is deliberating a possible strike against Syria in retaliation for the Syrian government&#8217;s alleged use of chemical weapons.</p>

<p>Honolulu was among 35 cities chosen for a tap water test in which one Honolulu resident collected a water sample from the southern part of Oahu last spring. Scientists found a chromium-6 level of two parts per billion in Honolulu&#8217;s tap water.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kitv.com/health/26200941/detail.html" title="KITV4 reports.">KITV4 reports.</a></p>

<p>Tap water from 31 of the 35 U.S. cities tested contains hexavalent chromium (or chromium-6), the carcinogenic “Erin Brockovich chemical,” according to laboratory tests commissioned by Environmental Working Group (EWG).

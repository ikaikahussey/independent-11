<p>Kauai County Mayor Bernard Carvalho has vetoed a popular bill that would have required top GMO companies on Kauai to disclose their pesticide usage and would have created a buffer zone around schools and hospitals where no pesticides could be used.</p>

<p>Carvalho cited legal concerns about the bill itself and also about the process used to create the bill, which was sponsored by Gary Hooser and Tim Bynum.</p>

<p>“As I have said all along, I truly believe that we could have accomplished these goals faster and in a legally sound manner by working cooperatively with the state, which has clear legal authority over buffer zones and pesticide disclosure,” wrote Carvalho.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; Residents who surrender old, but working, appliances will be eligible for a cash reward through a new program offered by Hawaii Energy, the state energy conservation and efficiency program.</p>

<p>The bounty program will reward residents who unplug and recycle up to one refrigerator, freezer and window air conditioner each and aims at reducing electricity consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

<p>“Many may not fully realize the amount of energy that can be wasted by older, less efficient models,” said Ray Starling, Hawaii Energy program manager. “We want this program to encourage people to have their old appliances recycled, particularly those that aren’t really necessary, like additional refrigerators in the garage that are usually empty.”</p>

<p>Old refrigerators and freezers can use more than twice the amount of electricity of newer models.&nbsp; In addition, refrigerators 10-years-old or older contain more than 120 pounds of recyclable steel. The energy saved by recycling such a refrigerator is enough to run a new ENERGY STAR® model for eight months.</p>

<p>Bounty program applicants must be a residential account holder with an electric utility on the island of Hawaii, Lanai, Maui, Molokai or Oahu in order to qualify.</p>

<p><strong>Oahu:</strong>&nbsp; Residents must notify Hawaii Energy of bounty appliances to be surrendered.&nbsp; The Participating Recycler (Refrigerant Recycling) will contact the resident to coordinate a pick up date along with instructions. The program will offer a $25 cash incentive per qualified appliance and free pick up.</p>

<p><strong>Hawaii and Maui County:</strong> Residents must personally drop off their appliances at a participating recycler (Hilo and Kona – Big Island Scrap; Maui – Hammerhead Metals) to receive a $35 cash incentive per qualified appliance.</p>

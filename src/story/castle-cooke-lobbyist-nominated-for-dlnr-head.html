<p>Carleton Ching, the government relations director for Koa Ridge developer Castle &amp; Cooke, is being tapped by Governor David Ige for the chairmanship of the Department of Land and Natural Resources. </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/governor-david-ige-nominates-chairperson-and-first-deputy-to-the-department-of-land-and-natural-resources/">official announcement</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>HONOLULU – Governor David Ige today announced the nominations of Carleton Ching to serve as Chairperson of the Department of Land and Natural Resources and Kekoa Kaluhiwa to the position of First Deputy.</p>

<p>Ching has devoted much of his career to creating communities for Hawaiʻi’s residents. Early on he spent a decade with the Hawaiʻi Housing Authority where he specialized in building affordable homes. From his time at the Authority he is best known for his role in facilitating a resolution to the contentious conflict between the Waiāhole-Waikane Community Association and the state. Following this he worked for Westloch, Inc., Castle &amp; Cooke Kunia, Molokai Ranch and SSFM International. Currently he is the Vice President, Community and Government Relations, for Castle &amp; Cooke Hawaii. In this role, he supports the organization’s real estate, agricultural and renewable energy initiatives. He is an active volunteer with a number of business, housing, health and education non-profit organizations.</p>

<p>“Stewardship of Hawaiʻi’s unique resources is one of the most critical tasks of State government, and Carleton Ching has the heart, knowledge and skills to lead the Department of Land and Natural Resources,” said Governor David Ige. “No one understands better the complex issues this Department handles and how to balance the needs of our environment and our residents.”</p>

<p>Ching graduated from Kaimuki High School and earned a Business Administration Degree at Boise State University where he was an imposing left tackle for the Broncos.</p>

<p>“It’s humbling to be asked to protect Hawaiʻi’s natural, cultural and historic resources,” said Ching. “I am committed to upholding the mission and purpose of the DLNR. My inspiration comes from my keiki and my moʻopuna. I want to leave Hawaiʻi a better place for them and for future generations.”</p>

<p>Ige&#8217;s pick for second-in-command of DLNR is Kekoa Kaluhiwa, who has worked previously for Senator Dan Akaka and First Wind, a renewable energy company.</p>

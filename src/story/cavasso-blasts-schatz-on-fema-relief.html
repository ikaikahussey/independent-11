<p>From Cavasso&#8217;s press release:</p>

<blockquote><p>GOP Candidate for U.S. Senate, Cam Cavasso believes FEMA&#8217;s rejection of Hawaii&#8217;s request for a disaster declaration is because Senator Schatz has few leadership skills and little power in Washington.&nbsp; Cam Cavasso stated today &#8220;Where is Schatz in this? A switched-on Senator would have been heading to Washington and the President to seek support and make sure FEMA declares the disaster immediately after the tropical storm hit and we became aware of the magnitude of the damage. Handing out water is just one of the things that could have been done by a Senator, but a Senator is so much more than that. In this matter, particularly when almost 3 weeks later 1600 people are still without Hawaiian telecom service and people are still without power, Senator Schatz has failed the people of the Big Island.&#8221; </p>

<p>Cavasso added: &#8220;Senator Schatz&#8217;s campaign advertisements seem to imply he has a direct line to President Obama.&nbsp; The rejection of the disaster declaration shows the people of Hawaii that Schatz has no influence where it matters most, and that is to obtain what is necessary for the people of Hawaii.&#8221; FEMA denied funds for &#8220;individual assistance for individuals and households affected by the tropical storm, ...and also hazard mitigation funds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cam Cavasso believes it is time for a change in Hawaii. &#8220;We need to elect people that know what to do and when to do it. When a disaster hits and you have the position of leadership, you stop campaigning for photo ops and go do what you should be doing as a Senator.&nbsp; It is all about priorities!&#8221;</p>

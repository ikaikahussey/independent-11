<p>Governor Ben Cayetano, candidate for Honolulu mayor, presented his alternative to heavy rail today. Dubbed &#8220;<a href="http://voteben2012.com/rail-rapid-transit/fast/">F.A.S.T.</a>,&#8221; for &#8220;Flexible Affordable Smart Transportation,&#8221; the proposal incorporates several components, at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion.</p>

<p>The Cayetano proposal includes:</p><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Express Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) for Leeward and Central Oahu as well as a College Express BRT connecting the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Hawaii Pacific University, Honolulu Community College and everything in between</li>

<li>Added Traffic Lanes on King Street and Nimitz Highway</li>

<li>Contraflow lanes on King St. and Dillingham Blvd.* to accommodate rush-hour traffic and dedicated BRT Lanes.</li>

<li>Short underpasses to reduce in-town congestion</li>

<li>A 2-mile elevated reversible Nimitz Flyover for express travel from the airport viaduct to Iwilei and downtown Honolulu</li>

<li>Island-wide traffic signal optimization and 21st century traffic management systems</li>

<p>On Tuesday, July 8th, from 5:30pm to 8:00pm, Progressive Democrats of Hawaii (PDH) and Americans for Democratic Action, Hawaii (ADA/H) will host a speed dating forum in the Kakaako Room, on the second floor of Ward Warehouse.</p>

<p>All the candidates running in the Democratic Party primary election, with the exception of Donna Mercado Kim, have agreed to participate in the event. The public is invited to attend. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the event, each of the six candidates will be given a few minutes to make opening remarks to the audience, after which guests will be broken up in to six smaller groups.&nbsp; The candidates will then have approximately 10-12 minutes with each group. </p>

<p>“The speed dating format is good because the guests can interact with each of the candidates in a more intimate setting, asking questions and having more useful conversations than they might have in a different format,” says Bart Dame, Co-Chair of PDH. </p>

<p>“We’ve held this event in the past for races in which there were more than just a few candidates running. When you have six candidates, a more traditional type of forum or debate setting doesn’t work nearly as well,” added John Bickel, President of ADA/H. “Our hope is that the guests leave feeling like they’ve had a chance to talk story with each of the candidates and maybe even choose who they will support.”</p>

<p>Members of the press are invited to attend.</p>

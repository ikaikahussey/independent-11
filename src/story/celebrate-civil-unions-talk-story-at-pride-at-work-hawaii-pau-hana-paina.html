<p>Join Pride At Work Hawaii at our next pau hana paina and talk story session on Friday, February 18 from 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Chiko&#8217;s Tavern (930 McCully St., one block makai from King St.). </p>

<p>There will be free pupus (funded with support from the Hawaii State AFL-CIO). Talk story about homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism you may have faced at work and in unions&#8212;and ways to confront them. Also come celebrate the passage of civil unions in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Pride At Work Hawaii advocates for full equality for LGBITQ workers in their workplaces and their unions, and works to build mutual support between the labor movement and the LGBITQ community. Pride At Work Hawaii (an affiliate of the Hawaii State AFL-CIO) is a chapter of <a href="www.prideatwork.org" target="_blank">Pride At Work</a>, a constituency group of the AFL-CIO.</p>

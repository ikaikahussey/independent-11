<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Hawaii&#8217;s small, colorful businesses have played a vital role in shaping the face of Kaimuki and making the way over the top of the hill along Waialae Avenue a truly vibrant one. Each year, Celebrate Kaimuki Kanikapila comes around to show its appreciation for the neighborhood&#8217;s participation in making Kaimuki what it is today. The festivities return next week Saturday, November 6 from 9:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. </p>

<p>The hugely popular craft fair and street festival, held at the intersection of Waialae Avenue and Koko Head as well as at Kaimuki Community Park, is free fun for the whole family. The Kanikapila raises money for scholarships awarded each year to high school seniors in the Kaimuki area. </p>

<p>Scheduled just before the holiday rush, the Kanikapila is the perfect venue to find local handmade arts and crafts, as all well as other unique gift items from over 115 vendors participating this year. Some of the featured artisans include Calvin G. Orr, Michael S.K. Lee, One Breath Photography, Imagine That!, Hana Lima, DecoWoods by Cindy, Once in a Blue Moon, G &amp; G Handcrafted Jewelry Designs, Julie’s Hot Glass, One by One Enterprises, Leialoha&#8217;s Stained Glass, Ki Design, Li-nan Ceramic Garden Art,&nbsp; Bets Hackney, Blue Urchin Studio, and SJH Enterprise.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>New this year are live herb plants for sale from the Family Tree Nursery. The nursery will also be sponsoring a free &#8220;Plant a Seed&#8221; booth, where children can plant their own Blue Lake bush bean seeds into a pot that they can take home and tend to themselves, thereby exposing them to lessons in nature, nutrition, and sustainability. </p>

<p>Come on an empty stomach because in addition to the shopping, there will be delicious food on hand, including the famous KC Waffle Dog. Other culinary highlights include Waiola Burger, Storto&#8217;s Deli, Bella Mia, and Café Hula Girl.</p>

<p>Continuous live entertainment will also occur on two stages. One to watch for on the Waialae Avenue Stage is <i>Brown Bags to Stardom &amp; Friends</i>, a Johnny Kai production featuring talent from Hawaii’s high schools.&nbsp;   </p>

<p>There are also notable prizes to be won, some of them from Kaimuki’s most popular eateries, such as Café Laufer (win a cake of your choice up to $59 value), and gift certificates from Kim Chee II, Happy Days Restaurant, Verbano, and Ichiban Sushi. The grand giveaway will be a &#8220;Passport to Kaimuki&#8221; prize package worth more than $300 in gift certificates and merchandise from Kaimuki restaurants and merchants. Visit the Kanikapila&#8217;s <a href="http://www.celebratekaimuki.com/" title="website">website</a> to download the entry form, or enter to win at the  Kaimuki Business and Professional Association (KBPA) Information Booth during the event itself. </p>

<p>Designated free parking will be available at the following five lots: Queen Liliuokalani School (two lots, enter on Koko Head Avenue) and Kaimuki Christian (two lots), plus 1241 12th Ave.&nbsp; The free parking goes quickly, so it is best to arrive early. Paid parking is available at Kaimuki Municipal Lots 1 &amp; 2 (enter from Harding at 12th Avenue), the AMPCO Lot  (behind 3660 Wilhelmina Rise), as well as limited street parking.&nbsp; There will also be special bike parking near Larry&#8217;s Auto Parts.</p>

<p>Celebrate Kaimuki Kanikapila is organized by the KBPA and the KBPA Foundation with support from the City and County of Honolulu and the Hawaii Tourism Authority. Founded in 1946, the Kaimuki Business and Professional Association (KBPA) is an organization dedicated to the improvement of Kaimuki by community involvement and welfare through the efforts of its members. It sponsors numerous community events annually in the Kaimuki area and serves as a voice to promote business and professional viewpoints on issues and concerns impacting Kaimuki.&nbsp; </p>

<p>KBPA members find that the organization&#8217;s projects, leadership, and teamwork experience enable them to integrate into the community in a rewarding way. And as the Kanikapila shows each year, the hard work of the entire community gives everyone lots to celebrate about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On this day in history in 1913, 8,000 women&#8217;s suffrage marchers walked down Pennsylvania Ave. This was the first large protest for womenâ€™s Suffrage in the city. They were met with large crowds of unruly men blocking their paths and shouting derogatory remarks. Many marchers were injured and congressional hearings would later remove the Chief of DC Police.

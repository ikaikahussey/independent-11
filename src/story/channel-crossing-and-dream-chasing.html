<p>&#8220;Paddling the 32-mile Ka&#8217;iwi channel from Molokai to Oahu is grueling enough, but for California&#8217;s Jeff Denholm and Hawaii&#8217;s Mark Matheson, who will be participating in the Molokai-2-Oahu World Championship of Paddleboarding on July 25, the race presents its own unique challenges. Denholm will be paddling with a prosthetic arm, while Matheson is a paraplegic, numb from the chest down.&#8221;</p>

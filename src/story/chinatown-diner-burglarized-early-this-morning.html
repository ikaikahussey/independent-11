<p>&#8220;Keep your ear to the ground.&#8221; </p>

<p>That&#8217;s what Serena Hashimoto is asking the community to do after the Chinatown bar she co-owns, <a href="http://downbeatdiner.com">Downbeat Diner</a>, was robbed early this morning.</p>

<p>The bar&#8217;s safe was stolen at at 4 or 5 am, she said. Thieves apparently disabled power to the building from the outside, crawled down the exhaust hood, and took security cameras.</p>

<p>Hashimoto doesn&#8217;t see today&#8217;s burglary as linked to the problems of chronic drug abuse and houselessness that have plagued the Chinatown area.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were someone stealing booze, maybe. But with the level of thought and planning, it&#8217;s not crackheads on the street. It&#8217;s a different type of crime,&#8221; Hashimoto said.</p>

<p>Hashimoto speculates that the lack of police attention in the area for drugs and vagrants could make it attractive for criminals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clearly we&#8217;re not cared for,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Josh86, the bar&#8217;s co-owner, notes that Downbeat is the tenth Chinatown bar in the last two years to be burglarized.</p>

<p>Downbeat opened nearly two years ago, on New Year&#8217;s Eve 2011. In that time, the business has become a fixture of the burgeoning downtown arts and culture scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;It could have been worse,&#8221; Hashimoto said, adding, &#8220;I&#8217;m counting on collective goodwill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Persons with information on the burglary can contact the Maunakea Street police substation by calling 529-3932.</p>

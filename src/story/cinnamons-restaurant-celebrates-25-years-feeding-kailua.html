<p>KAILUA&#8212;Kailua is at a critical point in its evolution as a town. The pressures of big stores like Safeway, Whole Foods, and Target are visceral, and residents are awakening to the need for self-definition to preserve the small-scale, local economy that defines the small beach-side community. As the editor covering Kailua, I see it everyday, and while sometimes I have the unfortunate obligation to document large corporations steamrolling grassroots protests, sometimes I have the pleasure of featuring resilient mom-and-pop joints succeeding in their original endeavor.</p>

<p>This week, <a href="http:// www.cinnamonsrestaurant.com/index/mn10481/Breakfast_Menu" title="Cinnamon's Restaurant">Cinnamon&#8217;s Restaurant</a> will mark 25 years of satisfying appetites in Kailua. I got to sit down with the founder and owner himself, Puna Nam, over a delicious frittata omelette and talk about his experience with the business and community over the past quarter century.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in the restaurant business for 15 years before starting here,&#8221; said Nam. He worked for hotel chains across the islands and was originally considering opening up a place on Maui, which was really picking up speed in the early 1980s, or Kona, where he eventually wanted to retire. His wife, however, used to frequent the Cinnamon&#8217;s spot&#8212;which was then Big Island Beef, or BIBs&#8212;and knew the owners. &#8220;One night, lo and behold, they said they were willing to sell,&#8221; Name said. &#8220;I was kind of reluctant, but we looked at it and decided to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After renovations and a name change (there&#8217;s a French fairy tale about a cinnamon bear who helps out with the baked goods) on March 1, 1985, Cinnamon&#8217;s Family Restaurant opened its doors. Since then, Nam&#8217;s wife&#8212;an avid baker&#8212;has been up at 4:00 a.m. to bake the biscuits, coffee cake, cinnamon buns, and desserts.</p>

<div class="pull-gold">&#8220;The key to being successful is being sensitive to the customers&#8217; needs and make sure they&#8217;re satisfied.&#8221;</div>

<p>Cinnamon&#8217;s is open 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and specializes in breakfast and lunch (they&#8217;re also open the first Saturday of the month from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. for dinner and Hawaiian music). Its breakfast menu, in fact, has not lost a single item but expanded, offering omelets, eggs Benedict, and skillet breakfasts, among many others.</p>

<p>&#8220;We came up with the skillet breakfast&#8212;that&#8217;s something I believe we developed,&#8221; Nam said. &#8220;We make our own fries; cut the potatoes, skin on, fry it, season it. Red and white onions, put it in a skillet.&#8221;</p>

<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary, they&#8217;re bringing back some of the original lunch items no longer served daily. To listen to Nam describe his menu items is to listen to a passionate man, indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throughout the years, we&#8217;ve revised the menu,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to keep up with what&#8217;s popular. For lunch, we dropped items, the double delight (salad greens with a scoop of tuna salad and chicken salad), ham and cheese on sweetbread, chicken fantasy&#8212;this one is good but it&#8217;s really involved. It&#8217;s a broiled fillet of chicken on a fresh spinach bed topped with broccoli, hollandaise, and swiss cheese.&#8221;</p>

<p>Also, he said, the coffee is more local than you might find elsewhere, where the blend can be just 10 percent Kona and be called Kona. At Cinnamon&#8217;s, the blend is 25 percent Kona and 25 percent Kauai.</p>

<p>Having been in the community so long, Nam has watched the town develop and change, which sometimes puts his personal and business interests at odds.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve lived here 40 years now,&#8221; Nam said. &#8220;As a resident, you want to keep the place just so, but with the density, there&#8217;s apartments, condos. The beaches are being used more, there&#8217;s more commerce. It takes longer to get places. But from a business standpoint, it&#8217;s good, you welcome the newcomers because it&#8217;s a broader market. But with more people, the prices go up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cinnamon&#8217;s is not the only business to have to change their menu and prices. However, they always offer an eco-friendly (economically, that is) daily special which is never more than $7.</p>

<p>&#8220;[Compared to] the big boxes: Target, Whole Foods,&#8221; Nam explained, &#8220;we&#8217;re different because we offer more of a personal touch. You can&#8217;t match big box prices but you can give it a personal touch. The key to being successful is being sensitive to the customers&#8221; needs and make sure they&#8217;re satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Nam isn&#8217;t backing down any time soon. In five years, when Cinnamon&#8217;s lease expires, Nam plans to renew. &#8220;The reason we&#8217;ve been able to survive the economy is because we built a strong customer base,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Another reason is our employees have been with us a long time. Our cashier, hostess, and three waitresses have been with us since we opened. The rest average 15 to 16 years here. They know peoples&#8217; idiosyncrasies, they have a good rapport.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cinnamon&#8217;s has also hosted to occasional fundraisers when staff have needed help, such as the recent fundraiser for a waitress&#8217; goddaughter who is three and has cancer. Then the staff all work volunteer hours and the restaurant stay open until night.<br />
 <br />
Nam is also president of the Kailua Chamber of Commerce, and the restaurant has done donations to various charities throughout the years.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a blow to a key Caldwell initiative, but it may be good for affordable housing. The city&#8217;s planned sale of its affordable housing properties has <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/241769691.html?id=241769691&amp;src=em">failed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A deal that would have netted the city $142 million for the long-term leases on 12 rental housing complexes was nixed by the prospective buyer, city officials announced tonight.</p>

<p>William Rice, an official with the managing partner of Honolulu Affordable Housing Partners LLC, said in a letter to city Budget Director Nelson Koyanagi that the group would not be able to come up with $35 million demanded by the city by March 31, the deadline for closing specified in an August 2012 sale agreement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The collapse of the deal leaves a $20 million puka in the city budget, which will likely increase the call for creative revenue options, such as bus advertising.</p>

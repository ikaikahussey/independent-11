<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On Thursday, October 20, City officials announced how Oahu residents can plan ahead and prepare for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit (APEC), which begins on the week of November 7.</p>

<p>“The City and County of Honolulu is prepared for APEC. We are ready to show off our city to the world,” said Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle. “Security for the 21 world leaders during the APEC summit is paramount, but we also recognize our residents and visitors may be temporarily inconvenienced. We want our citizens to have as normal a life as possible during this time while these security measures are in place. We ask everyone for their patience and cooperation, and to please plan ahead.”</p>

<p>Security restrictions were released today by the federal government. One is from the U.S. State Department, which covers the APEC Leaders Week events taking place at the Hawaii Convention Center from November 7 through November 13. The second one is from the U.S. Secret Service and it specifically covers the APEC Leaders Meeting taking place on Saturday, November 12, at the Hale Koa Hotel and on Sunday, November 13, at the Ihilani Resort.</p>

<p>People who live or work in these areas should review the information to get an accurate picture of how they may be impacted during APEC, then plan ahead and prepare accordingly, officials said.</p>

<p>The City posted online the federal press releases along with maps that summarize both of the State Department and the Secret Service restrictions. There are also maps that show where roadways and parking may be affected during APEC, as well as detour routes for certain City buses.</p>

<p>City agencies such as Transportation Services, Environmental Services and Honolulu Police Department will continue to update APEC-related information on their respective sites.</p>

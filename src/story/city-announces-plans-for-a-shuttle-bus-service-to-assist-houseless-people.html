<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who immediately filled his role following Mufi Hannemann&#8217;s resignation to run for governor yesterday,&nbsp; announced that the City and County of Honolulu is helping to launch a new shuttle bus service that will link shelters and transitional housing in Kalaeloa with employment sites in nearby communities and the Kapolei Transit Center.</p>

<p>The announcement comes days after hundreds of houseless people were evicted from the Waianae coast. The eviction has been part of an ongoing process by the City to remove houseless people who live on public parks and beaches. Other City measures targeting houseless people in the past include prohibiting sleeping on bus stop benches and a failed effort to keep people who &#8220;smell bad&#8221; from getting on the City&#8217;s buses.</p>

<p>“It is not enough to simply remove homeless people from parks, beaches, and beneath freeway viaducts and leave them isolated from the rest of our community,” Caldwell said in a statement, despite it being the City&#8217;s strategy for years. “The purpose of this shuttle bus service is to make it easier for people who are rebuilding their lives in Kalaeloa to find and keep jobs, provide for themselves and their families, and keep appointments that help them address any other issues that caused them to become or remain homeless.”</p>

<p>The shuttle bus service is expected to begin on weekdays in about one month, and will be operated by Hawaii Helping the Hungry Have Hope (H-5).</p>

<p>Facilities to be served by the shuttle bus include:</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Onelauena Shelter, Waianae Community Outreach;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Homeless Veterans Substance Abuse Program, United States Veterans Initiative;</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Hale Ulu Pono Shelter, Steadfast Housing Development Corporation; and</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Kumuhonua Shelter, Honolulu Community Action Program.</p>

<p>The total cost of this project will be approximately $148,000 for one year. Collaborating with the City on the program are the Federal Transit Administration, State Department of Human Services, Hawaii Community Development Authority, Waianae Community Outreach, and H-5.</p>

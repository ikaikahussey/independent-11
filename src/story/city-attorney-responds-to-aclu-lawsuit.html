<p>City and County of Honolulu Corporation Counsel Donna Leong issued the following statement today in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawai‘i Foundation:<br />
 <br />
“The Department of the Corporation Counsel will defend the city in this lawsuit vigorously. In other challenges, federal courts have upheld the constitutionality of the Stored Property and Sidewalk Nuisance Ordinances. The ordinances support the safety, health, and welfare of all residents of the City and County of Honolulu and the city believes the ordinances will survive the current challenge.<br />
 <br />
“The city will continue to enforce the Stored Property and Sidewalk Nuisance Ordinances.”</p>

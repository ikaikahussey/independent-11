<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu has awarded grants of $5,000 to eight nonprofit organizations through the Mayor’s Production Grant Program.</p>

<p>The grant program, now in its sixth year, is the only grant program in Hawaii to provide support for the production of new artistic works in dance, theater, music, literature, and short film that will be part of each organization’s future repertoire.</p>

<p>The City’s Commission on Culture and the Arts reviewed the proposals submitted and awarded the following:</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Alliance for Drama Education, for the production of T-Shirt Theatre’s <i>Passion</i><br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Bamboo Ridge Press, for the publication of <i>Three Years on Doreen’s Sofa</i><br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Filipino Community Center, for the production of <i>Banda Kawayan</i><br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Hawaii Community Television, for the short film <i>Lost and Found Kukan</i><br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Hawaii Gamelan Society, for the production of <i>Forty Years of Gamelan in Hawaii</i><br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Monkey Waterfall, for the production of <i>Celebrity on the Run</i><br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Na Pualei O Likokehua, for the production of <i>Na Lani Eha</i><br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Taiko Arts Center, for the production of <i>Taiko and Sabar</i></p>

<p>William Feltz, a Culture and the Arts commissioner and member of the Grant Review Committee said: “We are delighted to see growing interest in the Mayor’s Production Grant Program over the years. With so many terrific programs being offered throughout the community, selecting only eight awardees was not an easy task.”</p>

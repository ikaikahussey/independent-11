<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu’s Department of Emergency Management today introduced a new communications service that allows the public to receive warnings and alerts about tsunami, hurricanes, and other emergencies.</p>

<p>The Nixle Community Information Service allows the messages to be delivered to subscribing residents instantly via cell phone text message and/or email. Notifications can also be accessed online at <a href="http://www.nixle.com" title="www.nixle.com">www.nixle.com</a>.</p>

<p>“This system provides another emergency communications tool for Oahu, in addition to the Emergency Alert System messages that are broadcast over TV and radio and the Outdoor Siren Warning System,” acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell said. “Residents can receive information directly from the Department of Emergency Management and take immediate precautions. It’s almost like having a personal tsunami siren. The system can also notify subscribers when a danger has passed.”</p>

<p>Messages may include public information on significant weather, high surf, and flooding events, as well as other relevant safety and community event information.</p>

<p>The service is free for subscribers. The City said there is no spam and no hidden cost. Standard text messaging rates may apply, however.</p>

<p>The messages can be sent to subscribers island-wide, and even on the mainland, or can be narrowed specifically to residents registered within a ¼ mile radius, giving them the opportunity to receive trustworthy information relevant only to their neighborhood. Subscribers can also choose the way in which alerts are received, whether it is by email, text message, or over the web.</p>

<p>Oahu residents can immediately begin receiving pertinent information via text message, email, and web by registering at <a href="http://www.nixle.com" title="www.nixle.com">www.nixle.com</a>.&nbsp; Residents can also sign up by texting their zip code to 888777.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A Honolulu City Council bill would authorize the use of overt video monitoring on Oahu for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings.</p>

<p>The purpose of the surveillance under <a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-116164/67hxpg40.pdf" target="_blank">Resolution 11-229</a> is to deter &#8220;criminal activity and to achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective and a legitimate public purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Video cameras would be installed throughout the island, including Waikiki, Downtown, and Ko Olina and be monitored from the bill&#8217;s passage through November 15. APEC runs from November 7 to 13. The newly installed cameras and current cameras will be utilized by the Honolulu Police Department and other City agencies.</p>

<p>Resolution 11-229 is scheduled to be heard by the City Council on Tuesday, August 30.</p>

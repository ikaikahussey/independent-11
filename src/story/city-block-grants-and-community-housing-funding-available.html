Both programs are funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>

<p>Community Development Block Grants are available for projects that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HOME money, meanwhile, is available to community housing development organizations and other qualified private nonprofit organizations to develop and support affordable rental housing and homeownership affordability. Community housing development organizations seeking to develop multifamily rental housing are given top priority. </p>

<p>The Request For Proposals is available at the Division of Purchasing, Department of Budget and Fiscal Services, Honolulu Hale, 530 South King Street, Room 115, and at <a href="http://www.honolulu.gov/pur" title="www.honolulu.gov/pur">www.honolulu.gov/pur</a>.</p>

<p>The City will hold an informational and orientation meeting for prospective applicants on Tuesday, September 21 from 9:00 a.m. at Mission Memorial Auditorium on the Fasi Civic Center grounds. The deadline for applications for both grant programs is 4:00 p.m., October 4.</p>

<p>The City’s online email notification system will continue to allow applicants for federal grants, available through the City’s CDBG and HOME programs, to receive email notification of funding opportunities whenever they become available.

<p>The City and County of Honolulu has broken ground for the new, modern Joint Traffic Management Center at Alapai Street across from the Honolulu Municipal Building. </p>

<p>The $5 million Alapai Transit Center will feature four 50-foot-long bus shelters with seating for more than 40 riders, a 10-foot, multi-use path along South Hotel Street for bicycles and pedestrians, bicycle storage, sign and audio announcement systems, public restrooms, and landscaping.&nbsp; The cost of the Alapai project is being split evenly between the City and Federal Transit Administration.</p>

<p>The City also broke ground for the parking structure for the Joint Traffic Management Center, representing the first phase of a multi-year, three-phase project.&nbsp; The parking structure, to be built atop the transit center, will have 418 stalls on five levels. The cost will be $20 million, all in City funds spread over several fiscal years.</p>

<p>The Joint Traffic Management Center will eventually house the traffic control operations of the City and state Department of Transportation, as well as operations of such first-responder agencies as Fire, Police, Emergency Services, and Emergency Management.</p>

<p>The parking structure is being built first to accommodate bus service. Design work on the two remaining phases will begin this year, with construction slated for late 2012.</p>

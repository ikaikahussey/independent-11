<p>HONOLULU &#8212; On Tuesday, May 3, The Honolulu City Council Parks and Human Services Committee will convene to discuss a variety of bills and measures that are notable for their specificity, and for the genuine, if limited, impact they may have on Honolulu’s civic identity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-110831/5z8x547p.pdf" target="_blank">Resolution 11-111</a> urges the City Administration to provide a status update on plans for the relocation of trees affected by the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project. The resolution further urges that plans be coordinated in cooperation with the Sierra Club and Outdoor Circle.</p>

<p><a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-97888/4xgbw-gx.pdf" target="_blank">Bill 13</a> will regulate the use of “electric personal assistive devices” (i.e. Segways) at parks maintained by the City.</p>

<p>Other neighborhood matters to be discussed by the committee include:</p>

<p>•
A proposed Ewa Beach district park near ocean pointe <br />
•
An Americans with Disabilities Act playground apparatus<br />
•
A proposal to reinstall overhead trellises at Sun Yat Sen Mall in Chinatown <br />

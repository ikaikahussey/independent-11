<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Former Honolulu Police Chief Lee Donohue was selected today by unanimous vote to take over Congressman Charles Djou’s vacated District IV seat. Chairman Todd Apo announced his selection just after 11:00 a.m. on June 9.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The filling of Djou’s vacancy was the first order of business in a lengthy agenda for today’s session, as the appointed person would immediately be able to vote on the matters that followed, including the city’s proposed $1.82 billion operating budget.</p>

<p>Various people from the community testified on behalf of their picks for the position, with the vast majority speaking in support of Lori Wingard, former Chief of Staff to Djou. Her supporters spoke of her character, integrity, fresh perspective, community support, and competence. Wingard herself took the stand to restate her reasons for running and to urge the council to consider her preparedness for a budget vote today. She was also the only nominee from the list on last week&#8217;s floor draft who had petitioned the community in support of her candidacy. Wingard had gathered 752 signatures as of today’s meeting.</p>

<p>Yet despite Wingard&#8217;s strong community support base, there was no motion made by the Council to amend the resolution to include her as one of the final nominees. Wingard had not promised to abstain from running in the fall, something that Councilmember Apo had urged of all candidates.</p>

<p>Instead, motions were made on behalf of Board of Education member Donna Ikeda, former legislators Brian Yamane and Carl Takamura, and Donohue, in that order. Each time a motion was made on someone’s behalf, that individual supplanted the former candidate.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Once the resolution was amended with Donohue&#8217;s name, Councilmembers Romy Cachola and Ann Kobayashi requested clarification as to the voting process. It appeared the Council was unclear about the fate of the original resolution to select Jonathan Lai. Because Donohue was the final name to whom the resolution was amended, he essentially replaced Lai’s name on the ballot. Apo confirmed that council members would only be voting on one amendment, i.e. one name, at a given time&#8212;meaning that should the current amendment pass, Donohue would take the seat. </p>

<p>It was at this point that a short recess was requested. The confusion in the room was palpable, and it appeared it might take awhile for a replacement to be finalized. </p>

<p>When the meeting was called back to order, Cachola proposed an additional amendment to add Lai’s name back to the resolution along with Donohue’s name in order to give him fair representation. Kobayashi seconded this motion. However, with four objections, the motion to add Lai&#8217;s name failed.</p>

<p>Councilmember Nestor Garcia proceeded to speak on Donohue’s behalf, noting how he would be valuable to decisions made regarding fireworks and public safety, as well as with preparing for the upcoming APEC conference. Councilmember Rod Tam agreed, saying Donohue “fit with the publics’ criteria.”</p>

<p>Kobayashi added that she would respect Djou’s independent position on the council. Cachola confirmed his support as well, indicating that his suggestion to re-include Lai’s name was more about fairness and procedure than preference, to keep the Council’s integrity intact. In the absence of further objections, the resolution with Donohue’s name was adopted and he was sworn in immediately.</p>

<p>Donohue, a resident of Hawaii Kai, served in the Honolulu Police Department for 40 years, retiring in July 2004. He was the first Hawaii police chief to integrate wireless technology into patrol cars and upgrade the HPD radio systems to digital. </p>

<p>He has declared that he does not seek election once his temporary appointment expires on January 2.</p>

<p>Honolulu District IV consists of Hawaii Kai, Kuliouou, Niu Valley, Aina Haina, Wailupe, Waialae-Iki, Kalani Valley, Kahala, Wilhemina Rise, a portion of Kapahulu, a portion of Kaimuki,&nbsp; Diamond Head, Waikiki, and a portion of Ala  Moana.</p>

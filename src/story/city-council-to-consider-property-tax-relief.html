<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Honolulu homeowners, and particularly North Shore residents, will be keeping a close eye on Honolulu City Councilmembers who will be considering property tax relief and the North Shore Sustainable Communities Plan next week.</p>

<p>A City Council public hearing on Wednesday, March 16 will address Bill 7, which provides tax relief to property owners on Oahu who are eligible. Under the bill, property owners of residential and commercial or industrial parcels are entitled to a tax refund based on the property’s classification and the tax paid for the 2010-2011 tax year.</p>

<p>The tax relief could be of great assistance to property owners who have seen taxes rise as property valuations fall. The median tax paid by Honolulu property owners, commercial and residential, in 2009 was approximately $1,700.</p>

<p>Under the bill, property owners of parcels that were reclassified from residential to commercial or industrial for the 2010-2011 tax year would be entitled to the tax refund. The amount would equal the difference between what the property owner actually paid versus what the property owner would have paid if the property was classified &#8220;Homeowner&#8221; and was taxed at the tax rate of $3.42 per $1,000 of assessed value, or was classified &#8220;Non-homeowner&#8221; and was taxed at the tax rate of $3.58 per $1,000 of assessed value.</p>

<p>The March 16 public hearing will also address Bill 9, regarding a zoning change on Oahu&#8217;s North Shore and Bill 61, which amends the North Shore Sustainable Communities Plan.</p>

<p>Under Bill 9, land situated at Mokuleia would be rezoned from F-1 Military and Federal Preservation District to AG-2 General Agriculture. </p>

<p>Through Bill 61, Councilmembers will decide whether to approve The North Shore Sustainable Communities Plan. The area boundaries of the plan extend from Kaena Point to Waialee Gulch near Kawela Bay, and from the shoreline to the slopes of the northerly ends of Waianae and Koolau mountain ranges.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Sustainable Communities Plan are not regulatory&#8212;they act as a guide for any development plans, public investment in infrastructure, zoning, and other regulatory procedures, as well as the preparation of the City’s annual capital improvement program budget.</p>

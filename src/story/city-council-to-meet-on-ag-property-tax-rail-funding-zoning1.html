<p>HONOLULU &#8212; The Honolulu City Council will meet Wednesday, July 6 to consider a number of bills relating to the City budget, as well as a number of zoning, planning, rail funding, and the Sand Island Wastewater Treatment Plant. Several of the matters of interest to be considered by the council should be of particular interest to taxpayers</p>

<p><a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-114055/618t2sh3.pdf" target="_blank">Resolution 11-168</a> authorizes the City Budget Director to issue and sell $475 million in General Obligation Bonds to fund the Cityâ€™s rail project. General Obligation Bonds are sold with the intent of repaying buyers through tax revenue.</p>

<p><a href=" http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-113435/60nlltmn.pdf" target="_blank">Bill 44</a> relates to property taxes on agricultural lands. The bill revises the availability of real property tax incentives provided by the City for dedication of agricultural land to agricultural use and adding clarifying language.</p>

<p><a href=" http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-114525/627vxh9w.pdf" target="_blank">Bill 46</a> rezones land in Waimanalo from Restricted Agricultural Use to General Agricultural Use. Restricted use requires a minimum 5 acre lot size and allows for pig farms. General use requires a minimum lot size of two acres and does not allow pig farms.</p>

<p>When  the council reconvenes after a lunch recess, it will consider the appointments of a number of individuals to a variety of nonelected City positions, including the Board of Water Supply, the Commission on Culture and the Arts, and at appeals boards of Building and Zoning Departments. </p>

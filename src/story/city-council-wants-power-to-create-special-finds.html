<p>Bernardo quotes Mike Hansen, director of the Department of Budget and Fiscal Services, as saying that allowing the council to create special funds &#8220;creates inflexibility in the budgetary process.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Special funds&#8221; are government revenue sources – taxes, fees – tied to the funding of specific programs. </p>

<p>Hansen&#8217;s remarks make perfect sense; it&#8217;s in the interest of the adminstration to want the greatest degree of flexibility for spending public monies. And it&#8217;s in the interest of the city council to attempt to control that spending using the very limited powers of the legislative branch.</p>

<p>The O‘ahu electorate will be able to vote on this matter in the November 6 general election.</p>

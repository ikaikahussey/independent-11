<p>KALIHI &#8212; Mayor Peter Carlisle and City officials today dedicated the Middle Street Intermodal Center, located at the intersection of Middle Street and Kamehameha Highway and adjacent to the existing Kalihi-Palama Transit Facility.</p>

<p>The Middle Street Intermodal Center is comprised of several projects. It includes the Handi-Van Administration and Maintenance Building, Handi-Van Parking Lot, Middle Street Transit Center, and a Park and Ride Lot.</p>

<p>The Handi-Van Administration and Maintenance Building and the Handi-Van Parking Lot were dedicated in previous years. Today, the City acknowledged the completion of the Middle Street Transit Center and its Park and Ride lot. </p>

<p>This project includes bays for staging buses and an expanded transit center to replace the existing bus service center. The passenger platform has a customer service center, which will issue bus passes and badges, a lost and found facility, two restroom buildings, a utility building, and security office. The passenger platform and customer service center are under a covered canopy with a “living wall” landscape in the center of the platform. Provisions have been made to allow connection to the future rail station at Kamehameha Highway.</p>

<p>The Middle Street Transit Center project cost $11,183,000.</p>

<p>The Cityâ€™s Department of Environmental Services responded this morning to a sanitary sewer overflow at 124 Olomana Lane in Pauoa. </p>

<p>The call came in at 6:20 a.m. An ENV crew arrived at 7:12 a.m. and secured the site at 7:32 a.m.</p>

<p>Grease clogged a 6-inch terra cotta sewer pipe causing 1,360 gallons of untreated wastewater out a manhole and into Pauoa Stream, which leads to Nuuanu Stream and eventually to Honolulu Harbor.</p>

<p>ENV cleaned, disinfected and deodorized the area and notified the state Department of Health.&nbsp; Signing and water sampling are underway.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  </p>

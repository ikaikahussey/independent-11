<p>The City and County of Honolulu announced that responding to Saturday&#8217;s tsunami warning cost the City approximately $330,000, including overtime for police and firefighters and lost revenue from City facilities that were closed, but that there is no doubt the expenses were fully justified.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was well worth it, given the excellent response we had,&#8221;&nbsp; Mayor Mufi Hannemann said. &#8220;The human and financial costs of failing to prepare for and respond effectively to a natural disaster such as a tsunami would be horrendous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after the tsunami potential was detected, the City and County of Honolulu Emergency Operating Center activated and was fully staffed. The Center was activated at 9:14 p.m., on Friday, Feb. 26, to coordinate City emergency preparation and response activities, and remained open throughout the night and next day, until the danger had passed.</p>

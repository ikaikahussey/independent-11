<p>HONOLULU &#8212; The City has placed a new ambulance into service to enhance emergency medical coverage and reduce emergency response times.</p>

<p>The new unit will operate daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., the period in which the most calls are typically made to 911 for medical emergency care. The ambulance is known as Kokua-1 to highlight the help the unit will provide during this peak period.</p>

<p>The new ambulance is based out of Kuakini Medical Center and will primarily service the area from Moanalua to Makiki, but can also be directed to Windward or Leeward areas if ambulances already serving those areas are busy. </p>

<p>The City typically receives 100 or more calls for emergency medical care in metropolitan Honolulu every 24 hours. Having an additional ambulance in service will help reduce response times.</p>

<p>A reduction in Emergency Medical Services overtime spending throughout the past year has allowed the City to place the new ambulance in service without any funding increase.</p>

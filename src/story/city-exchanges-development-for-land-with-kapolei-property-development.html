<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;The city is taking a step into downtown Kapolei development, as it will be gaining 34 acres of undeveloped land from Kapolei Property Development (KPD).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Mayor Mufi Hannemann brought the plan to the public during his State of the City speech in February stating that in exchange for the land, the city will develop these sections of land with the assistance of federal aid and public-private partnerships on properties from the deal. The land will also be developed in a timelier schedule compared to if KPD continued ownership of the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;This exchange appears to be very beneficial to the City, KPD, and the greater Kapolei community. In exchange for doing the construction, the City will obtain important parcels directly in the urban core of Kapolei&#8212;parcels that will be part of the long-term transit oriented development plans with the rail project,&#8221; said Kapolei Council Chair Todd Apo. &#8220;The biggest benefit for the region is that the main artery running through Kapolei and all the way through Ewa will be completed in a timely fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the rough agreement already written up and signed by KPD, Hannemann will sign it after the city council approves the exchange of land deal. The city and KPD agreement, resolution 10-49 was put on the Council Budget Committee&#8217;s March 3 agenda for action. Assuming the resolution will be approved, it will give the city a key role in the future of major development in the downtown Kapolei area.</p>

<p>The mile-long section of Kapolei Parkway acquired in the deal is an important element in advancing Kapolei. The city has designated 13-acres for a mass-transit station and the rest of the land unknown.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is one concern that I have raised. I am hoping to be able to place some parameters on the City&#8217;s future use and plans for the parcels. At this point, the administration has not stated any intention for the use of these parcels,&#8221; said Apo in response to plans the city has for the land. </p>

<p>For KPD, the land agreement means weight off their shoulders, as they will no longer be responsible for developing the section of road. KPD is an associate of the James Campbell Company LLC and the head of planning for the Kapolei Parkway area.</p>

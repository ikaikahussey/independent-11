<p>Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle today announced the launch of &#8220;Honolulu 311,&#8221; a new system through which the public may use personal smart phones to report abandoned vehicles, broken street lights, illegal dumping and other issues.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Besides encouraging the public to help alert City officials about ongoing issues, Honolulu 311 also allows people to submit photographs illustrating these situations, and can pinpoint their locations using built-in GPS systems.<br />
 <br />
The app is available on iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry.<br />
 <br />
The information submitted through the system will be reviewed and forwarded to appropriate departments for action.<br />
 <br />
The app can be downloaded for iOS by clicking <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/honolulu-311/id474923564?alreadyRedirected=1&amp;ign-mpt=uo=2&amp;mt=8">here</a>.</p>

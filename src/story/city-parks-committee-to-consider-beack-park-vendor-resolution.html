<p>LEEWARD COAST&#8212;The Honolulu City Council Parks and Human Services Committee will convene on Tuesday, June 21 to consider several resolutions, including one that will create a three-year pilot program to allow commercial activity at City parks in Leeward Oahu.</p>

<p><a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-114547/628j_jdt.pdf" target="_blank">Resolution 11-177</a> would permit vendors to set up tables and kiosks to sell food and crafts to beachgoers at City parks during the hours between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Urged by the Nanakuli Neighborhood Board and introduced by Councilmember Tom Berg, it is hoped that the resolution will stimulate economic growth in Leeward Oahu.</p>

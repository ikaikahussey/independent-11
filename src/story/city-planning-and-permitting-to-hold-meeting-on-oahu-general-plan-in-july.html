<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;S Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP) is initiating the review and update of the <a href="http://honoluludpp.org/Planning/GeneralPlan/GPReport.pdf" target="_blank">Oahu General Plan</a>. A community meeting has been announced to present the project’s purpose and scope, discuss preliminary findings, and begin gathering community comments. </p>

<p>According to the City, the Oahu General Plan &#8220;sets forth the long-range objectives and policies for the general welfare and, together with the regional development plans, provides a direction and framework to guide the programs and activities of the City and County of Honolulu.&#8221; Landowers, business owners, community organizations, and residents are invited to attend the meeting. Registration begins at 5:15 p.m.</p>

<p>The General Plan is a guide for the future of the island of Oahu. The update will focus on overall growth, tourism, agriculture, affordable housing, and sustainability. It is an appropriate time to review and update the plan, now that Oahu’s agriculture has diversified, tourism has matured, and the secondary urban center is becoming a reality.</p>

<p>The City has hired the planning firm<a href="http://www.hhf.com/" target="_blank"> Helber, Hastert and Fee</a> to assist with this update.&nbsp; Information on the General Plan, research reports, summaries of current issues, and how to receive email notifications,<a href=" http://honoluludpp.org/planning/OahuGenPlan.asp" target="_blank"> visit here</a>.&nbsp; </p>

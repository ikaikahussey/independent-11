<p>Mayor Peter Carlisle will have a seat to fill in his cabinet on Monday, with the departure on Sunday of Department of Planning &amp; Permitting Director David Tanoue.</p>

<p>Tanoue confirmed by email today that he is resigning, effective tomorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> My last day with the City is 9/30.&nbsp; I start on 10/01 at RM Towill Corporation as Vice President and will be managing its planning department and it&#8217;s surveying department.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#8217;s following in the footsteps of Carlisle and Hannemann alumnus <a href="http://www.rmtowill.com/senior-management/collins-lam-pe">Collins Lam</a>, who left the cabinet in 2011 to lead RM Towill&#8217;s surveying and mapping departments.</p>

<p>Established in 1930, RM Towill Corporation is a major engineering consulting firm, with business interests throughout Hawaii and the Pacific.</p>

<h2>Criticism</h2>
<p>As director of the Department of Planning &amp; Permitting, Tanoue came under criticism from North Shore residents for meeting with developers of the Envision Laie project. <a href="http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/Carlisle-Supports-Tanoue-As-Head-Of-DPP/qSRFeD69K0ONIkiGKkKvuA.cspx">As reported by Andrew Pereira for KHON</a> on November 8, 2010, during Tanoue&#8217;s confirmation process:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He admittedly met with developers from the LDS church as well as Hawaii Reserves Incorporated, their development arm, and allegedly met with numerous developer representatives from Turtle Bay behind closed doors,&#8221; said Tim Vandeveer, co-chair of the Defend Oahu Coalition.</p>

<p>Others like Punaluu resident Cathleen Mattoon accused Tanoue of ignoring the recommendations of the Koolauloa Planning Advisory Committee.</p>

<p>“Never in all my years of citizen participation in government have I experienced such shoddy treatment,” Mattoon testified.&nbsp; “By his own admission Mr. Tanoue met privately with developers and made the decision to ignore the PAC.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Next in command</h2>
<p>Tanoue&#8217;s departure leaves Deputy Director Jiro Sumada as the logical acting director until Mayor Carlisle leaves office in a few months.</p>

<h2>Lame duck Carlisle</h2>
<p>One question raised by Tanoue&#8217;s exit is whether this signals an exodus from Peter Carlisle&#8217;s lame duck administration. Following his poor performance in the August primary election, his coattails have shrunk considerably. </p>

<p>Who&#8217;s the next to leave?</p>

"teaser":"A Honolulu city council committee will meet today at 5 pm to discuss the sale of city-run affordable housing units to a private firm, Hono­lulu Affordable Housing Partners LLC, for a price of  $142 million in cash and an additional $42 million in improvements to the 12 facilities.  Gordon Pang, reporting for the Star-Advertiser, quotes Keith Ishida, director of the city housing office:  <blockquote> \"It's a transaction that will relieve the city taxpayer of the need to continue to subsidize these properties while providing residents with a much better living environment because they'll get, basically, $42 million in capital improvements over three years,\" Ishida said. \"That's something our city could never do given our fiscal condition.\"  Some residents and <a href=\"http://www.facehawaii.org\">FACE</a> worry that rents may go up under the new management arrangement. However, Ishida said, \"that's something that transcends this particular transaction. … No matter who buys these properties, rents have to go up.\" </blockquote>",

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu has launched a recruitment initiative designed to increase awareness of fire fighting careers for women.</p>

<p>The Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) and the Department of Human Resources will hold a series of three “Can You Take the Heat?” workshops on Saturday, January 21, 2012, at the Charles H. Thurston Training Center at 8:00 a.m., 10:30 a.m., and 2:00 p.m. Each session is free and expected to last approximately 90 minutes. Parking will be available at the rear of the building.</p>

<p>Topics will include the online application process, HFD career opportunities, and the firehouse culture from a woman’s perspective.</p>

<p>To register, visit <a href="http://www.honolulu.gov/hr" target="_blank">www.honolulu.gov/hr</a> between January 6 and 13, 2012. Registration is free and will close at 11:59 p.m. on January 13. Seating is limited and will be filled on a first-come, first-serve basis. Register early to ensure a seat is available, as only the first 95 registrations will be accepted for each session. Only registered individuals will be allowed to attend the seminar.</p>

<p>The City will be accepting applications for Fire Fighter Recruit (FFR) in early 2012. Applications must be completed online during the recruitment period.</p>

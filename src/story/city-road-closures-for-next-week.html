<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City &amp; County of Honolulu is undergoing dozens of projects that will result in lane and road closures across Oahu. Also, three public events will mean further road closures. The Aloha State Games take place Sunday, June 19 at Kapiolani Park. Also on Sunday, the Brotherhood of Punchbowl Holy Trinity Feast Procession will cause road closures in the Pauoa area. The Murphyâ€™s Bar &amp; Grill Magic on Merchant event on Saturday, June 25 will close Merchant Street from Nuuanu Avenue to Bethel Street.</p>

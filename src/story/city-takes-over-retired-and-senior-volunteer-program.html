<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City’s Elderly Affairs Division (EAD) has been awarded a three-year grant by the federal Corporation for National and Community Service to enable EAD to assume sponsorship of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), effective today.</p>

<p>RSVP is a nationwide volunteer program for people age 55 and above who are passionate about sharing their time and talents in various community settings: schools, hospitals, museums, parks and beaches, senior meal sites and many others. The program already has over 500 volunteers and 60 community organizations serving as volunteer stations. EAD plans to focus its volunteer recruitment on provision of in-home support services for frail elders, and for caregivers in need of respite.</p>

<p>“Talent is one of the most important factors in economic growth,” acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell said. “A talented aging population combined with a desire to contribute to the community can create a tremendous return for society&#8212;an ‘experience dividend’&#8212;for the public good.”</p>

<p>The initial $141,000 award covers the first 15 months of the grant, allowing EAD to take over sponsorship of the program from the State of Hawaii&#8217;s Department of Human Services.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; Mayor Peter Carlisle announced Friday that the City is now making permits available online for the installation of charging stations that allow homes to power electric vehicles. The new system facilitates speedier permitting and supports the City&#8217;s sustainability and climate protection strategy, he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making it easier for people to start using electric vehicles and help decrease our dependence on fossil fuels that harm our environment,&#8221; Carlisle said.</p>

<p>The announcement was made in conjunction with the Hawaii Automobile Dealers Association, the State Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, and Hawaiian Electric Company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Transportation electrification is one of the integral components of Hawaii&#8217;s move to a clean energy future,&#8221; said Estrella Seese, Acting Energy Program Administrator of DBEDT&#8217;s State Energy Office.</p>

<p>DBEDT&#8217;s Electric Vehicle Rebate Program, supported by federal stimulus funding, will provide rebates of up to $4,500 toward the purchase of new electric vehicles. Rebates of up to $500 are also available for the purchase and installation of new electric vehicle chargers in homes or business sites. Combined rebates of $5,000 are available toward the purchase of an electric vehicle and charger. Rebates are provided on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the availability of funds, and expire on Sept. 30, 2011.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>The State Energy Office has awarded $400,000 in federal stimulus funds to the City for electric vehicles, charging stations and the online permitting system. </p>

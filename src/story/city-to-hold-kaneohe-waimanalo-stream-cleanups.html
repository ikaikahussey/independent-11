<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In celebration of Earth Day, the City’s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) is conducting two Adopt-A-Stream cleanups this Saturday, April 23 in Kaneohe and Waimanalo.</p>

<p>Check in for both events is at 8:00 a.m. Volunteers for the Kaneohe (Kawa Stream) event should check in at Castle High, below the HECO substation on Kaneohe Bay Drive. Those wishing to participate in the Waimanalo (Kahawai Stream) cleanup should check in near Weinberg Village on Kalanianaole Highway. The cleanups run from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.&nbsp; </p>

<p>ENV, who partners with numerous businesses, schools, public officials, the State, and military, provides general oversight of volunteer safety, supplies, trash bag disposal, education, outreach and enforcement in adopted areas. Volunteers need to sign a release form at check-in. Participants should bring water, wear a hat, old shoes, sunscreen and dress to get dirty.</p>

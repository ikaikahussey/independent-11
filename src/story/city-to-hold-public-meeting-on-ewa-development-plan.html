<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu’s <a href="http://honoluludpp.org" target="_blank">Department of Planning and Permitting</a> will hold a public information meeting on the results and recommended changes of its review of the Ewa Development Plan and implementation process. The meeting will be held on Tuesday, November 1, at Kapolei Hale. Registration and a talk-story session with City planners will begin at 6:00 p.m., with the formal meeting starting at 7:00 p.m.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The review is in response to public comments and suggestions collected from five public workshops, more than 20 community interviews, and over 60 letters and emails.

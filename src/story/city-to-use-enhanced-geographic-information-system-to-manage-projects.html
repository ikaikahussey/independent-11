<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu announced the initial implementation of new enterprise-wide software solutions based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) that the City says will improve public safety and allow city projects to be handled more efficiently, and with more accountability.</p>

<p>For example, application upgrades to the City&#8217;s wireless 911 emergency response system will now enable first responders to view high resolution, variable perspective imagery to help pinpoint the location of the mobile 911 caller.</p>

<p>And a linked Property Assets Management system will help to manage the City&#8217;s real property, such as buildings and land. GIS information will help locate and track maintenance needs, and will be integrated with triggers and tools to facilitate contracting.</p>

<p>One of the adopters of the new system will be the Department of Facilities Maintenance (DFM), which will initially automate work management for street resurfacing and sidewalk maintenance. The system can eventually be expanded to deal with more than 50 other public works functions serviced by DFM, such as graffiti removal.</p>

<p>Property assessors will also be able to compare actual imagery of properties to match with city records so as to provide the most updated and accurate property information. The system can also be used to match building permit records at the Department of Planning and Permitting.</p>

<p>Department of Information Technology Director Gordon Bruce envisions city-wide adoption of GIS technology.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many city departments have similar &#8216;paper-based&#8217; work order systems that lack the ability to track projects this precisely and provide valuable new information that allows for more overall efficiency,&#8221; Bruce said. &#8220;We are looking at Parks and Recreation, Transportation Services and other departments eventually adopting the system too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The GIS data includes county-wide administrative boundaries and data developed and maintained by the City and County of Honolulu GIS. This will include County and incorporated City boundaries, federal reservations, Native Hawaiian, and large State and County parks. The data may also include land ownership information. Data also includes City governmental facilities developed and maintained by the City Public Safety agencies as possible. This initial dataset will cover police, fire, major State and County offices, and school information in the form of zero-dimensional (point) data indicating the location offacilities along with basic information on facility type.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; The City’s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) reminds residents to recycle their Christmas trees after the holidays.</p>

<p>Households with City collection should place bare trees – without flocking, ornaments and tinsel – curbside as part of your normal green waste pickup.</p>

<p>The City provides curbside green waste collection to more than 160,000 homes on Oahu.&nbsp; For those with green carts, trim and cut trees to fit inside the cart with the lid closed.</p>

<p>For households on a manual collection route, cut the tree into lengths up to three feet, bundle and place at curb on your refuse day.&nbsp; If cutting the tree is a bother, residents can drop it off whole at the nearest Refuse Convenience Center. </p>

<p>For condo residents, trees may be dropped off at any refuse convenience center or directly to the composting facility – there is no tip fee charged for Christmas trees over the holidays, courtesy of the City.</p>

<p>A movement to transform citizen interaction with city government is underway. 140 programmers, designers, students, and city employees gathered Saturday for <a href="http://citycamphnl.govfresh.com/">CityCamp Honolulu</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> focusing on open-government technologies to make Honolulu residents a bit easier.</p>

<p>The value proposition is this: If government will open up access to its data, programmers, designers, and journalists will be able to build technology that empower citizens. </p>

<p>For those who&#8217;ve combed through government documents for budget info, waited in interminable lines for permits and vehicle registrations, or wanted to get quick info about bus arrivals, the movement towards civic-oriented technology is welcome.</p>

<p>If advocates such as <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/forestf">Forest Frizzell</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bytemarks">Burt Lum</a> have their way, Saturday&#8217;s discussion was the hors d&#8217;oeuvres for a year of data and app feasting. Up next: a hack-a-thon in mid-January, to build the apps envisioned by CItyCamp attendees. Stay tuned!</p>

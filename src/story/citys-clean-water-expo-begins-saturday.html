<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In celebration of Earth Month, the City’s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) is co-sponsoring numerous ocean-oriented activities on Saturday, April 9. The events include Adopt-A-Stream and Block cleanups along with the Mauka to Makai Clean Water Expo.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great opportunity for everyone, especially families, to learn how to take care of our environment,” Mayor Peter Carlisle said. “The City and County of Honolulu is proud to be working with our partners to inspire others to get involved in protecting our natural resources.”</p>

<p>The Expo is free from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Waikiki Aquarium. Parking is available at the Waikiki Elementary School with a free shuttle service. The first 500 families through the gates will receive a free native plant and “The Journey Home” English-Hawaiian activity book. Those in attendance will also have a chance to win a custom Earth Month surfboard from Surf Garage or an annual family pass to the Waikiki Aquarium.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <br />
More than 30 agencies and organizations will showcase earth-friendly activities. One of the feature attractions is the moi release at 12 p.m. Winners of the Earth Month Teen Video Contest will also be recognized. The state Department of Health co-sponsors the Expo.</p>

<p>Four ENV Adopt-A-Stream and two Adopt-A-Block events focus on the Manoa Watershed. Stream cleanups take place at Manoa-Kolomono Ditch (8:30-11 a.m.), Manoa-Woodlawn (10 a.m.-12 p.m.), Palolo (8:30-11 a.m.) and Ewa Beach (8:30-11 a.m.).

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) and 350 volunteers from dozens of organizations successfully completed the Pearl Harbor Bike Path Cleanup Saturday, April 16. </p>

<p>Approximately 3.5 tons of trash and debris were collected along the 13.5-mile section of the bike path from Aiea to Kapakahi Stream in Waipahu. Furthermore, about eight cubic yards of mulch and 200 native plants were planted to minimize erosion and filter sediment runoff to Kapakahi Stream and Puuloa Natural Springs.</p>

<p>The event was sponsored by ENV, Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, Pearl City Lions Club and Hawaiian Electric Company. Cooperating agencies/organizations include HPD, DLNR, DOCARE, Council Members Nestor Garcia and Breene Harimoto, legislators, the City&#8217;s Department of Parks and Recreation and Department of Facility Maintenance, U.S. Army, Waipahu High, Olelo and youth groups. </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Honolulu City Council announced that applications are now being accepted for awarding funds for land acquisition through an application process established by its Clean Water and Natural Lands Commission. Applications will be reviewed by the Commission, which will make recommendations to the City Council on projects to be funded through the Clean Water and Natural Lands Fund. Final selection of projects to be funded will be made by the City Council as part of the annual budget process. Applications are due October 1 at 4:00 p.m. </p>

<p>“The City Council has approved a total of five outstanding Oahu land conservation projects in the first two cycles of applications to this Fund,” said City Council Chair Todd Apo. “The Council encourages the public to work with the Commission through the application process and to provide input that will assist it in making its recommendations to the Council.” </p>

<p>To date, the City Council has approved acquisition of the following conservation projects: Kukaniloko, Sunset Ranch, Honouliuli Preserve, Kunia Agricultural Research Station, and the Fong Plantation. </p>

<p>According to Commission Chair Marjorie Ziegler, the Commission has established an application process that reviews various criteria, including protection of watershed lands, historical or culturally significant land areas and sites, forests, beaches, coastal areas, and agriculture lands. </p>

<p>Proposed projects may seek preservation of these areas through acquisition of fee title or conservation easements. Ziegler said that the Commission will also consider factors such as the degree of urgency, financial support from other sources, and how a proposed project relates to the city’s existing budgetary or other priorities. </p>

<p>In 2006, Honolulu voters approved a charter amendment that set aside a portion of real property tax revenues for land conservation. In 2007, the Council established the Clean Water and Natural Lands Fund (Ordinance 07-18) and the Commission (Reso. 07-355 CD1). The Commission was established to advise the City Council on the use and expenditure of these funds. </p>

<p>A resolution proposed earlier this year by the City Council would have replaced the independent Commission with a committee that would “advise the City administration on the expenditure of moneys in the Fund.” <a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-101815/5542k9mv.pdf" title="Resolution 149">Resolution 149</a> died in committee.</p>

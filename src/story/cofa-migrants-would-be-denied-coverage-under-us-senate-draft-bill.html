<p>From the Center for Budget Priorities:</p>

<blockquote><p>One left-out group are individuals from the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau who work and reside in the United States under Compacts of Free Association (COFA).&nbsp; These individuals often live and work in the United States for most of their lives and have families here, often including U.S.-born children.&nbsp; COFA communities, like other lawfully present people, have permission from the federal government to live and work here and pay U.S. taxes but will no longer be able to buy insurance to get access to comprehensive medical services and provide financial security under GOP plans to repeal the ACA.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In the midst of growing frustration with the political climate of the country, the grassroots movement Coffee Party USA has declared March 13, 2010 National Coffee House Day, during which Americans across the country will meet at coffee houses and around kitchen tables to facilitate informative and civil dialogue about a myriad of issues. The non-partisan organization has drawn members from all walks of life and works toward reestablishing civic pride and having a strong desire to contribute to the political discourse that is the basis of democracy.&nbsp;   </p>

<p>The Oahu chapter of Coffee Party USA will host National Coffee House Day on Saturday, March 13 from 10:00 a.m. at Kapiolani Coffee Shop, 98-1277 Kaahumanu St., at Waimalu Shopping Center in Aiea.</p>

<p>The Coffee Party movement gives voice to Americans who want to see cooperation in government, and welcomes everyone to the table. </p>

<p>&#8220;We are purely grassroots movement, independent of any party, corporation, or lobbying organization,&#8221; said Annabel Park, the founder of Coffee Party USA. That is our strength and we plan to use it to facilitate a collaborative process that would encourage people to come together as a community, checking party affiliation at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>As voters and grassroots volunteers, they intend to use new media and social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to support leaders who work toward positive solutions, and hold accountable those who obstruct them.&nbsp; </p>

<p>On March 13, National Coffee House Day, Coffee Party USA plans to take the next steps towards creating a movement that will reignite the passion for civil discourse and participatory democracy that has been absent from the political arena for some time. </p>

<p>&#8220;We want a society in which democracy is treated as sacrosanct,&#8221; Park said. &#8220;The Coffee Party is a call to action. Our Founding Fathers and Mothers gave us an enduring gift&#8212;Democracy&#8212;and we must use it to meet the challenges that we face as a nation.&#8221;&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Coffee Party USA is a diverse grassroots movement that acts to bring civil discourse back to the coffee tables, coffee shops, and living rooms of America. The movement began January 2010, when Park, of Washington, DC, posted her feelings about the state of American politics on her Facebook page, and her message hit a nerve. Two weeks later, her newly created group Coffee Party USA gained more than 90,000 followers. Founded upon the principles of participatory democracy and civic duty, this movement has lead to the creation of Coffee Party chapters across the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should not divide ourselves over differences of opinion,&#8221; Park said. &#8220;We need to be one community. Our democracy is what unites us as a people. We must protect it, and to protect it we must engage in the political process, respecting the reality that we are diverse nation with diverse points of view.&#8221;</p>

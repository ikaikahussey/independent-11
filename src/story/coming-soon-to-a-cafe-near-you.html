<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce a new print piece which we&#8217;re debuting in coffee shops and stores around the island: &#8220;Growing Pains,&#8221; a graphical take on population growth in Hawaii. The piece is designed by Joshua Lake of <a href="http://www.airspaceworkshop.com">Airspace Workshop</a>, a local design firm. It&#8217;s part of our effort both to spread the word about the Independent, and also to find new and innovative ways to tell Hawaii&#8217;s story. Hawaii&#8217;s explosive growth since 1950 has indeed led to growing pains – a strained water supply, clogged roads, food insecurity, and houselessness. Thanks to Josh for providing a visual starting point for these discussions.</p>

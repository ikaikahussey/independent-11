<p><b>The following was written by State Rep. Kymberly Pine (R), who represents Ewa Beach, Iroquois Point, and Puuloa.</b></p>

<p>Retired Army reservist Alika Wietecha and Vietnam Army veteran Ron Prescott are both business-owners that that could benefit from legislation that is being proposed this session to ask the State to do at least three percent of its business with Hawaii-based veteran-owned businesses. Mr. Wietecha owns Kapolei-based A M Landscaping, and Mr. Prescott is president of Tokunaga Masonry.</p>

<p>My colleagues and I announced on Tuesday, January 10 our proposal to present this legislation in the upcoming session as 14 other states have similar laws. We held a news conference to share our plans as veteran Mike McKenna&#8217;s Windward Ford offices and many veterans showed their support.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will help a lot,&#8221; said Wietecha, who returned from Iraq in 2004. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to start, shut down, and start again after 15 months. This will help companies get back on track.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wietecha also explained that the legislation will also be of great help to the veterans&#8217; families, who are also affected by deployment. </p>

<p>In addition to supporting other veterans with his business, Wietecha also offers people with special needs the opportunity to volunteer with his company and learn new skills.</p>

<p>It is veterans like Mr. Wietecha who give of themselves to our country and our community that we want to help with this legislation. The bill would give a 4.5 percent preference for a veteran-owned business, and a 5 percent preference if a veteran were service disabled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is near and dear to my heart,&#8221; says David Bateman, a veteran and owner of Heavenly Hawaii Farm, which produces Kona Coffee. &#8220;To help returning and retired veterans to work in our economy. We want to thank our veterans.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the 2007 Census, there are 10,000 veteran-owned businesses in Hawaii. One out of seven business owners in the nation are veterans, which translates to 2.4 million veteran-owned companies.</p>

<p>Rep. Gene Ward (R) pointed out that one in five people in Hawaii are related to someone in the military and that Hawaii has the most military in the state.</p>

<p>As a Navy wife, the grand daughter of a Pearl Harbor attack survivor, and a board member of U.S. Vets, issues affecting our veterans are important to me. Other legislative issues I plan to work on this session include re-opening an emergency room on the Leeward side, agriculture, cyber crime, and emergency preparedness.</p>

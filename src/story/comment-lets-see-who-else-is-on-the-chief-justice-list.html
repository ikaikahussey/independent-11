<p>The State Senate should not confirm Katherine Grace Leonard as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court. </p>

<p>Leonard is just one name from a list submitted by the Judicial Selection Commission to the governor for the court vacancy. The State Bar Association is saying that she&#8217;s unqualified for the job. If there&#8217;s any doubt about Leonard&#8217;s qualifications, we should move to the next candidate.</p>

<p>Our goal, simply put, should be to find the best person for the job. If that takes time, so be it. But it&#8217;s worth it, particularly given the decade-long initial term which the new Chief Justice would receive.</p>

<p>The sex-equality argument raised by Hawaii Women Lawyers is a red herring. Hawaii has proven over the centuries that we&#8217;re not limited to male leadership: We&#8217;ve had chiefesses, queens, a female governor, and transgendered elected officials. Leonard said it her itself in her introductory remarks: She doesn&#8217;t want to be the best woman for the job, but rather, the best person for the job.</p>

<p>She may not fit that bill. We need to examine the other candidates on the list.</p>

<p>The last days of an unpopular lame-duck governor is the wrong time to lock our state into a decade-long controversial pick for our top judicial office.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s any doubt about her fitness for the job&#8212;and there clearly is&#8212;by all means, let&#8217;s take some time, and work our way through the candidates until we find the right person for the job.</p>

<p>Two important items, among other things, are on today&#8217;s agenda at the neighborhood level at Honolulu Hale.</p>

<p>Honolulu&#8217;s Neighborhood Board Commission will be hearing a petition to dissolve the Koolauloa Neighborhood Board because of alleged corruption.</p>

<p>The Commission is also considering extending a Neighborhood Board member&#8217;s term from two years to four years, a move the City says will save $210,000.</p>

Monday, January 24 at 6:00 p.m.<br />
Honolulu Hale, Council Committee Room, 2nd Floor<br />

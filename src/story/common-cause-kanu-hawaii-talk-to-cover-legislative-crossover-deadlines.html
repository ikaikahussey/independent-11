<p>Common Cause and Kanu Hawaii meet every Thursday at 5:30 p.m. at the State Capitol Rotunda to discuss what is happening in the legislative calendar, provide tips for how citizens can participate effectively, share updates on priority bills, and visit legislators&#8217; offices. Guest speakers from partner organizations will also share their issues for the legislative session.</p>

<p>The Rotunda Roundups are designed to help everyone get involved at a more convenient time. </p>

<p>Today, March 10, they will be talking about the &#8220;crossover&#8221; legislative deadline and then visit the Public Access Room on the fourth floor of the Capitol.</p>

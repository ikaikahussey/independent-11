<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Kaimuki is home to both iconic commercial buildings such as the Art Deco style Queen&#8217;s Theater, the Chapel at Kapiolani Community College, and numerous classic Hawaiiana residences, many of which continue to be in danger of demolition. Local preservation advocates came together last week to discuss the future of Kaimuki&#8217;s architectural gems. </p>

<p>The meeting held at Kapiolani Community College saw roughly 40 attendees, including Rep. Barbara Marumoto, City Councilmember Ann Kobayashi, members of the Kaimuki Neighborhood Board, <a href="http://www.historichawaii.org/" title="Historic Hawaii Foundation">Historic Hawaii Foundation</a> staff members, Nancy Wilcox of Friends of the <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/13328/" title="Queen Theater">Queen&#8217;s Theater</a>, and concerned local residents. </p>

<p>The discussion covered a range of issues surrounding the preservation of Kaimuki, and why its unique character is worth saving.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>The meeting began with a brief survey of Kaimuki&#8217;s history. Kaimuki, means &#8220;ti oven,&#8221; a reference to the legend of the Menehune cooking ti roots in the area, according to the Historic Hawaii Foundation. Kaimuki is a naturally dusty, dry area that wasn&#8217;t heavily populated during pre-contact times because of a lack of water supply. The only spring known today is on Luakaha Street near the Salvation Army. Kaimuki was envisioned as a suburb, where the residents could commute to Honolulu each day for work. As the automobile gained popularity and suburbs towards Koko Head were constructed, Waialae Avenue was solidified as a major throughfare that boomed with business. The 1980s and &#8216;90s saw traditional bungalow style homes replaced by residential &#8220;boxes&#8221; and an increase in larger, wealthier homes that continues today.</p>

<p>The preservation discussion sowed the seeds for the creation of an organization similar to Manoa&#8217;s <a href="http://www.malamaomanoa.org/" title="Malama O Manoa">Malama O Manoa</a> (formed in 1992 as the &#8220;Manoa Historic Preservation Committee&#8221;), which among many other goals, strives to preserve and protect the unique and historical qualities characterizing the valley. </p>

<p>The meeting&#8217;s attendees also discussed preservation resources available to individuals as well as strategies for starting up a successful grassroots movement.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Although several buildings were referenced during the meeting, Queen&#8217;s Theater, located at the heart of Waialae Avenue, featured prominently in the conversation. Built in 1936 in the Art Deco style, the theater has been abandoned since the mid-1980s and was added to the Historic Hawaii Foundation&#8217;s list of Hawaii&#8217;s most endangered places in 2006. In its heyday, the theater was a venue for everything from vaudeville to movies. During its later years, it was well-known for midnight showings of the <i>Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>.</p>

<p>Public opinion remains divided regarding the current value of the theater, with some calling it a treasure and others an eyesore. Some wish for renovation, others demolition, and still others want it to remain as is. Particularly frustrating for many of those in the preservationist camp is the fact that that the owner, Narciso Yu, an enigmatic and reclusive figure, will not authorize renovation. He is also nearly impossible to contact, so for the time being the building remains in limbo.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Jill Byus Radke, development director for the Historic Hawaii Foundation, said that the meeting was &#8220;a success because of the enthusiasm of the group, the strong showing by the community&#8217;s elected officials, the great advice from those who founded Malama O Manoa, and the diversity and depth of knowledge of those in attendance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Radke also acknowledged the participation of the neighborhood&#8217;s own kamaaina.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the best and brightest architects, historians, realtors, and community leaders live in the community and many were there,&#8221; Radke said. &#8220;Even those who would never consider themselves &#8220;preservationists&#8221; articulated the problem of the tear-downs, &#8220;Garage-Mahals,&#8221; and &#8220;McMansions&#8221; and how they are slowly turning Kaimuki into &#8220;a southern California-looking neighborhood.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>As the face of Kaimuki continues to change, those who attended the meeting voiced resistance to further development.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they understand that all the laws and regulations can&#8217;t save their neighborhood as effectively as a community that values what they have,&#8221; Radke said. &#8220;The kamaaina seem more determined than ever to build a community ethic of preservation. Doing that takes a long time and a lot of patience but it&#8217;s the most effective way.&#8221;</p>

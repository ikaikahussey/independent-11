<p>HONOLULU&#8212;After years of community planning and reinvestment, the first changes of many are arriving in Kakaako.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hcdaweb.org/" target="_blank">Hawaii Community Development Authority</a> along with Kakaako&#8217;s surrounding community have spent years developing a master plan for the area, designed to create a new and vibrant cultural center in the heart of the district. Part of their plan incorporates a weekly outdoor marketplace with a special focus on community.</p>

<p>The area within the mauka side of Ala Moana Boulevard, part of the Kakaako Community Design District, is studded with some of Hawaii&#8217;s highest high-rise residential buildings&#8212;some approaching 400 feet.</p>

<p>In 2002, the Hawaii Community Development Authority adopted the &#8220;Waterfront Business Plan&#8221; covering use and development for the area between Kewalo Basin and the University of Hawaii&#8217;s medical school in Kakaako. Public pressure and successful legislation led to the preservation of the area for a large space open park, learning centers, and other opportunities for public use.</p>

<p>In 2009, the Hawaii Community Development Authority, retained MVE Pacific and its team of development and planning specialists to lead the community-based master planning process for Kakaako Makai. Building upon the three years of work completed by the Kakaako Community Planning Advisory Council, the consulting team, over a 14-month period, analyzed physical site characteristics, reviewed the local economic influences, market demand and viability of commercial and other land uses, while engaging the public through stakeholder interviews, a series of hands-on workshops, open houses and focused meetings. </p>

<p>In the plan, the Kakaako Makai area has been redesigned to emphasize local performers, history, culture, crafters, artisans, farmers, fish, and foods. </p>

<p>Spearheading the transition is the <a href="http://kakaakomakaimarket.com/" target="_blank">Kakaako Makai Community Cultural Marketplace</a>, slated to open on Friday, June 10.</p>

<div class="pull-gold">“All of our vendors know that we promote only locally grown foods, and locally produced items.&#8221;</div>

<p><br />
“We intend to build a community cultural village at Kakaako Makai,” said community manager Juanita Kawamoto in a statement. “We want to provide a place where our ohana and kupuna can pull together and share what they know. We also want local non-profits, civic clubs, and educational organizations to come down and join us&#8212;possibly to fundraise, definitely to raise awareness for their causes.”</p>

<p>While cultural awareness is the primary focus of the community endeavor, the market will also host local farmers, fishermen, artisans, and chefs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Current vendors include PacifiKool-Island Ginger Drinks and Syrups, Aunty Nani&#8217;s Hawaiian Cookies, Hawaiian Food Chef, Aloha Wainani Fresh Fish, and Aikane Coffee Farm. Market management is still reviewing and accepting vendor applications.</p>

<p>“All of our vendors know that we promote only locally grown foods, and locally produced items,&#8221; Kawamoto said. &#8220;We want the Kakaako Makai Community Cultural Marketplace to support our local family farmers, our local artisans, and our local community. We are even donating a percentage of our market profits to the Next Step (&#8216;homeless&#8217;) Shelter and the Hawaii Children’s Discovery Center.”</p>

<p>The Kakaako Makai community managers also said sustainability is a big part of their vision. Non-biodegradable plastics, Styrofoam, and GMO produce are strictly forbidden. </p>

<p>“We have found affordable ways for our vendors to provide their services without contributing to our State’s environmental degradation,&#8221; Kawamoto said. &#8220;We would like to see all local vendors become more environmentally aware, and we hope that our marketplace can help reset the standard.”</p>

<p><i>Marketplace hours are on Fridays from 4:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. beginning June 10. (The market will close early, at 1:00 p.m., on June 11 due to a Concert in the park.)

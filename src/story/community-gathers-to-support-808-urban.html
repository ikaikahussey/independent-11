<p>In case you missed it: there was a silent auction with local artwork, including pieces from Na Mea Hawai‘i; ‘ono food from Street Grindz; beats from Seph 1; the wrap of Dana Paresa&#8217;s <a href="http://fluxhawaii.com/archives/little-black-bag/">Little Black Bag</a> exhibit; macaroons from <a href="http://cakeworkshi.com">Cakeworks</a>; and a healthy supply of sidewalk to chalk.</p>

<p>808 Urban is an important organization, channeling the experiences of local youth into powerful, public art. Learn more about them at <a href="http://808urban.org">808urban.org</a>.</p>

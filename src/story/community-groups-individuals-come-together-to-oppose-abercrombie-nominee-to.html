<p>￼JOINT STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO THE CONFIRMATION OF TED YAMAMURA</p>

<p>￼We, the undersigned, urge all Senators to REJECT the Governor&#8217;s selection of ￼land appraiser Ted Yamamura as the member of the Commission on Water<br />
￼Resources Management because:</p>

<p>• He does NOT meet the mandatory statutory criterion that CWRM members each have &#8220;substantial experience in ... water resources management&#8221; and admits he would be learning his duties and responsibilities on the job;<br />
• The Nominating Committee established by statute to recommend candidates to the Governor conducted no interviews and met for only once for 45 minutes in performing its duties;<br />
• His appointment would create a geographic imbalance on the CWRM,with 4 members being from Maui; and<br />
• His appointment bypasses several other CLEARLY qualified applicants who could serve with distinction on the CWRM.</p>

<p>As citizens, we urge the State Senate to prudently exercise its constitutional advice and consent role by demanding stricter compliance with the clear statutory qualification required for the CWRM members.</p>

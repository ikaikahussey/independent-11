<p>MAUI&#8212;A Community Paint Exchange and recycling event will be held in the parking lot of Whole Foods Market at the Maui Mall in Kahului on October 29, 2011 from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Items accepted at this event include usable paint, primer and stains, and batteries of all types including vehicle batteries.&nbsp;  No other household hazardous waste products will be accepted. Free usable paint will also be offered to residents at the event.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;We are always trying to think of ways to make recycling easier. Every little bit helps,&#8221; said Rhiannon Chandler, Executive Director of Community Work Day Program, in a statement.</p>

<p>Additionally, wire baskets will be available for $8.00 deposit. Wire baskets allow for drainage and help to keep beverage containers clean and sorted.</p>

<p>Paint that is not usable will not be accepted at the event, and is not accepted at the Landfill in liquid form. Residents with paint that is no longer usable are asked to mix their paint with cat litter, lawn clippings, or saw dust to solidify it. Paint that has been solidified can be accepted at the Landfill.&nbsp; </p>

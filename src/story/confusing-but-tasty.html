<p>From INhonolulu Mag:</p>

<p><em>So how was it? Tasty. Sort of what you’d expect. The ramen buns reminded me of fried saimin (duh) and Chinese cake-noodles; I like both of those things. The patty itself was of good quality and prepared well. But eating the two together created a sort of cognitive dissonance, as one friend put it. The Ramen Burger subverts your mouth-feel expectations and leaves you wondering what’s going on.</em></p>

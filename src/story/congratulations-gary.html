<p>The Hawaii Independent is proud to see Gary Hooser, &#8216;one of our own,&#8217; <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov/newsroom/press-releases/governor-announces-three-more-appointments">appointed</a> by Governor Abercrombie this week to head up of the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/health/environmental/oeqc/index.html">Office of Environmental Quality Control</a>. Gary is a former journalist and business owner, and has been a real asset to our fledgling news source. We&#8217;re glad to see him move on up, right into the executive branch. Good for him.</p>

<p>On a related note: Hawaii needs more people who are willing to function as public intellectuals: staking out a position, advocating an idea, and debating it publicly. There&#8217;s a handful of bloggers who do this regularly â€“ see <a href="http://ilind.net">here</a>, <a href="http://blog.volcanicash.net/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.freecatholic808.com">here</a>. For our part, we&#8217;ll work on linking to the public debate wherever it&#8217;s happening, on blogs and such. If we&#8217;re missing important thinkers, please let us know. Mahalo.</p>

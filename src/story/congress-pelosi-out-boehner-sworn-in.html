<p>Republican Rep. John Boehner of Ohio was sworn in to lead a 242-194 majority, including a giant 87-member class of newly elected Republicans there in part because of a voter backlash against former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat, who became the Minority Leader. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/01/06/MNV81H4J75.DTL" title="San Francisco Chronicle reports.">San Francisco Chronicle reports.</a></p>

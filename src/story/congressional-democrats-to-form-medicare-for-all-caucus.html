<p>Some 60 House Democrats have announced the formation of an official Medicare for All Caucus to examine specific policy components of a single-payer healthcare system and to discus its implementation in the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is another sign that we are winning the fight for Medicare for All,&#8221; tweeted Bonnie Castillo of National Nurses United. &#8220;And it wouldn&#8217;t be possible without the hard work of grassroots activists that door-knock, phone-bank, and table in their communities every day. This fight, like many others, will be won in our own neighborhoods.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;This is a sea change from just four or five years ago and people are more likely to see healthcare as a right,&#8221; Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) told <em>Vice News</em>, which <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/d3epbm/exclusive-over-60-house-democrats-are-forming-a-medicare-for-all-caucus">broke the story</a> on Wednesday, July 18.</p>

<p>Jayapal is one of the Democrats who will join Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), National Nurses United and other progressive groups to officially launch the caucus with an announcement on the morning of July 19.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every day more Americans are rallying behind the need for fundamental reform of our flawed and fragmented healthcare system that denies care to millions of our neighbors and family members,&#8221; NNU co-president Deborah Burger added in a statement. &#8220;With polls showing increasing support for Medicare for all, and new signs every day of a system that is out of control, the formation of this congressional caucus could not be more timely.&#8221;</p>

<p>A <em>Washington Post</em>-Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 51 percent of Americans—and 74 percent of Democrats—support a single-payer healthcare plan over the current for-profit system, which has left around 30 million Americans without any health insurance.</p>

<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders&#8217; (I-Vt.) proposed &#8220;Medicare for All Act&#8221; currently has 15 Democratic co-sponsors, while the House &#8220;Medicare for All&#8221; bill—introduced by Ellison—has the support of nearly two-thirds of the Democratic caucus.</p>

<p>&#8220;The impetus for this caucus is to have a real discussion and work with our offices to see how a system would really work as we think about implementing it,&#8221; Jayapal said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about a growing movement to bring a Medicare for All system into being.&#8221;</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Congresswoman Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) was elected to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in the 112th Congress (2011-2012) today. </p>

<p>Hirono&#8217;s approval came unanimously by the 21-member Region 2 caucus, comprised of Democratic members of Congress from Northern California, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas.</p>

<p>The Democratic Steering and Policy Committee is responsible for making committee assignments and policy recommendations. It consists of the elected party leadership, members elected by region from the party membership, members appointed by the leadership, and the ranking members of the Appropriations, Budget, Energy, and Commerce, Rules and Ways and Means Committees.</p>

<p>“We have not had a member from Hawaii elected to this Committee in more than 15 years, since Patsy T. Mink served in 1993-1994,” Hirono said. “I look forward to this opportunity to help direct the policy agenda of the House Democratic Caucus. As a member of this committee, I will develop even closer relationships with leadership, which will give me increased opportunities to advocate for Hawaii.”</p>

<p>The Democratic Steering and Policy Committee is chaired by the Democratic leader (Speaker Nancy Pelosi now, Minority Leader Pelosi in the upcoming Congress), who is assisted by two co-chairs (currently Congressman George Miller of California and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut).</p>

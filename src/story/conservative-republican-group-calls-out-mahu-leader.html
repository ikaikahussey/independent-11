<p>Tito Montes, head of the Hawaii Republican Assembly, is making ad hominem statements about Hinaleimoana Wong, a kumu hula and OHA candidate. Hawaii News Now <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/24412905/head-of-republican-assembly">reports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Montes remarks were part of his criticism of the state&#8217;s Pono Choices sex education program. Montes and other Republicans say the program is too graphic for middle school students and is not medically accurate.</p>

<p>Wong-Kalu appeared in a Pono Choices skit about HIV risk and here&#8217;s how Montes described her:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Kumu&#8217; is the video short story of a transvestite drag queen who wears lipstick, eye liner, a dress, a padded bra and earrings,&#8221; Montes wrote.</p>

<p>And while we&#8217;re on the subject of far-right voices, here&#8217;s the take from from <a href="http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesDailyNews/tabid/65/ID/11581/January-10-2014-News-Read.aspx?utm_source=January+12,+2014+News+from+Hawaii+Free+Press&amp;utm_campaign=January+12,+2014+Email&amp;utm_medium=email">Hawaii Free Press</a>:</p>

<p>Tranny Asserts Absolute Right to Promote Himself to 6th Graders</p>

<p>HNN: Tito Montes, president of the Hawaii Republican Assembly, is under &#8216;fire&#8217; for calling (pointing out that) a respected Hawaiian leader and cultural practitioner (dude in a dress is) a &#8220;transvestite&#8221; and a &#8220;drag queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Mr.) Hina Wong-Kalu&#8212;who considers herself (sic) a transgendered female&#8212;says the name calling borders on hate speech. (Censorship: Unless you accept the lie that gender is changeable, you are a hater.)</p>

<p>&#8220;To utilize words transvestite and drag queen in any political debate is taking a cheap shot,&#8221; Wong-Kalu said. (Translation: I tell you what you may say and you bow before my authority.)</p>

<p>Montes remarks were part of his criticism of the state&#8217;s Pono Choices sex education program. Montes and other Republicans say the program is too graphic for middle school students and is not medically accurate.&nbsp; (Yes.&nbsp; Among other things, it asserts that gender is a choice and sexual orientation is not.)</p>

<p>Wong-Kalu appeared in Pono Choices skit about HIV risk and here&#8217;s how Montes described her (sic):</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Kumu&#8217; is the video short story of a transvestite drag queen who wears lipstick, eye liner, a dress, a padded bra and earrings,&#8221; Montes wrote.</p>

<p>Wong-Kalu, who is the chair of the Oahu Burial Council, shot back:</p>

<p>&#8220;A transvestite is someone who puts on clothes, a man who puts on women&#8217;s clothes in the middle of the night for once in a while but this is not temporary for me. This is an everyday element of my life,&#8221; she (sic) said. </p>

<p>(And this is what your 6th grader is learning now that gay marriage is the law.&nbsp; Changing the family unit is not enough, they will now attempt to browbeat you into acquiescing to the lie that gender is changeable.)</p>

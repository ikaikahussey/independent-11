<p>This amendment seeks to add to the list of public improvements for which the state is authorized to issue special purpose revenue bonds. </p>

<p>Currently, the state may issue bonds for improvements to public utilities, health care facilities, government housing, among other things.&nbsp; The amendment asks for voter approval to add &#8220;dams and reservoirs&#8221; to that list. </p>

<p>A special purpose revenue bond is kind of debt that state is authorized to hold. In this case, the state would issue bonds to build and/or repair dams, and then use the revenue from fees or taxes associated with those dams to pay bond holders in the future.</p>

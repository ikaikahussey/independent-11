<p>This amendment seeks to authorize the hiring of retired Justices or judges on a limited basis.&nbsp; Currently, judges and Justices must retire by age 70.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hawaii&#8217;s court system has a long standing backlog of cases. The Judiciary regular hires &#8220;per diem&#8221; judges&#8212;judges who work for a limited period of time&#8212;to hear cases and minimize some of the existing case backlog. </p>

<p>This amendment would allow the Judiciary to hire retired judges or Justices in a fashion similar to &#8220;per diem&#8221; judges.&nbsp; Judges or Justices hired pursuant to this amendment could serve at the same court level that they served at prior to retirement, or lower. </p>

<p>The Judiciary submitted testimony in support of this amendment. </p>

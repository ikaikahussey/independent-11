<p>HAWAII KAI&#8212;Construction of the a sewer main along Kalanianaole Highway and a portion of Lunalilo Home Road is expected to be complete by the end of the year. The majority of the work will take place between the hours 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on weekdays. The portion of the work on Kalanianaole Highway will occur between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Limited work during night hours may also be required. Notification of the project, including a map and contact information, will be distributed to affected residents and businesses.</p>

<p>Hawaii American Water recently began the work on the sewer main improvement project in Hawaii Kai. The project will replace approximately one-quarter mile of pressurized pipeline, which is a critical component in the collection system used to convey wastewater to the East Honolulu Wastewater Treatment Plant. </p>

<p>According to project manager Lee Mansfield said replacement of the 50-year-old pipeline is necessary because it has nearly reached the end of its useful life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Making these types of investments in our system today will reduce the potential for sewage spills and will protect human health and our environment for years to come,&#8221;&nbsp; Mansfield said.</p>

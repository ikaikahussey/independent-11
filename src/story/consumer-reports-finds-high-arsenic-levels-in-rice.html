"teaser":"A new Consumer Reports <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/files/finalarsenicembargo91912.pdf\">study</a> finds high levels in arsenic in rice.   Tom Philpott, food and agriculture blogger for Mother Jones, reports:  <blockquote> What's the takeaway from all of this? To avoid excessive exposure to arsenic, Consumer Reports recommends that adults limit their rice intake to two quarter-cup servings per week; children, they say, should get just 1.25 servings per week. In the long term, Urvashi Rangan, director of safety and sustainability at Consumer Reports, told me, \"what we'd really like to see happen is for the FDA to get serious about getting arsenic out of chicken feed.\"  </blockquote>",

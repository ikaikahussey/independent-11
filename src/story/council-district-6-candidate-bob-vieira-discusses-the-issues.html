<p><b>What do you feel is the single most important issue you will face if elected?</b><br />
Reducing the cost of basic services of the City by streamlining and consolidation.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled by the Council presently?</b><br />
[I would conduct] an internal audit by a national consultant such as Booz, Allen Hamilton. </p>

<p><b>What is another important issue in your district?</b><br />
A candidate, Tulsi Gabbard-Tamayo, who was a representative in the Legislature for Ewa, Waipahu, and Honouliuli, who has recently relocated to the district [District 6] and who has not lived, rented, owned property there, or even on Oahu.</p>

<p><b>What is different about your approach to that issue?</b><br />
We will feature this in the <i>Star Advertiser</i> so that voters know the truth.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
Myself, no others.
</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your strategy in dealing with the &#8220;homeless&#8221;?</b><br />
A &#8220;homeless&#8221; tent city at Sand Island State Park.</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
Against. Ridership will not support it. We have other alternatives such as elevated freeways, the same right-of-ways, and contra-flow lanes.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
Advertising in the <i>Star Advertiser,</i> television, and radio.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii&#8217;s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Create a small business czar with a private sector board of directors.</p>

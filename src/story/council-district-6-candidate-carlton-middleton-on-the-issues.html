<p><b>What do you feel is the single most important issue you will face as a Councilmember if elected?</b><br />
There are two: First one is homelessness; second is rail. I am in favor of, and will vote for [legislation affecting] both. The voters do not want homeless people moved from park-to-park. That is not ending homelessness. That is moving homeless around. The voters want homelessness ended. And that is what I will do. I will end homelessness as we know it now. The laws need to be changed so it encourages people to move from the streets into final housing. Final place means the last place. I am currently now, as I have for the past 29 years, working on that problem. How we will end homelessness is by getting me elected to the Honolulu City Council, District 6. I will not name the solution at this time. </p>

<p>Next issue is the rail. The people want the rail. Time and again the people have told us, candidates, they want rail and I will give it to them. Also, we need rail and the ten-thousand ($100,000 per year) full-time jobs. These full-time, high-paying, &#8220;living wage&#8221; jobs will last about 13 to 15 years. Also it will get people out of traffic.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled by the Council presently? </b><br />
I would change it by ending homelessness. As I have said before, I am not going to mention how in this forum. I will end homelessness as we know it now and my vote will be the final vote for rail, too. The City Council has voted many times before. Enough already! I hope to be the fifth vote. I will do it in a heart-beat. We shall break ground for rail shortly after I am sworn-in on January 2, 2011.</p>

<p><b>What is another important issue in your District?</b><br />
Helping and encouraging small businesses to grow. There are too many boarded up empty-spaces (where small businesses used to be) in my district and that businesses need to be and all that comes with the dollar trickle-down. These spaces need to be filled with employees that are earning and spending, because they are earning a decent wage, at other places, which creates more jobs, so people are paying taxes so needed services get funded. Let us follow that dollar and watch the economy grow.</p>

<p><b>What is different about your approach to that issue?</b><br />
I am more willing and able to go that extra mile, work hard, and do whatever it takes, by spending my time for that perfect solution.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
Me. Just the way it should be. I owe no one &#8220;nothing&#8221;!</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your strategy in dealing with the homeless?</b><br />
See issue number one, above. I have been working on ending homelessness for the past 29 years. It will take a little longer. But we will do it. </p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
Pro-rail. Yes, we can afford it. What we cannot afford is to not build it and fast!</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
 Recruit better candidates. Jail the corrupt politicians with long sentences and make examples of them.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii&#8217;s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Helping and encouraging small businesses to grow. There are too many boarded up empty-spaces (where small businesses used to be) in my district and [where] businesses need to be and all that comes with the dollar trickle-down. These spaces need to be filled with employees that are earning and spending, because they are earning a decent wage, at other places, which creates more jobs, so people are paying taxes so needed services get funded. Let us follow that dollar and watch the economy grow. Yes!</p>

<p>HONOLULU—There are now 10 candidates for Honolulu City Council District 6, as of the Office of Elections Candidate Report on July 23. <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> submitted the same list of questions to each of the 10 candidates. Responses will be published in the order in which they are received.</p>

<p>District 6 is comprised of a portion of Makiki, Downtown Honolulu, Punchbowl, Liliha, Pauoa Valley, Nuuanu, Alewa Heights, Papakolea, Kalihi Valley, and a portion of greater Kalihi.</p>

<p>City Council District 6 candidate Dennis Nakasato most recently ran for the district seat in 2002. According to OurCampaigns.com, he has held seats in the State House in 1980, 1982, 1984, and the State Senate in 1992. </p>

<p><b>What do you feel is the single most important issue you will face if elected?</b><br />
Money. Like everything else in life, you need money to get things and to do things. The public demands so many things that cost money and often loses sight that government has no money. It is the taxpayers&#8217; money that is been spent to give the services that the public demands.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled by the Council presently?</b><br />
I don&#8217;t know how the Council does its annual budgetary review, but they must go through some emotional moments. The question boils down to who/what do you cut and by how much. No one wants to be the bad guy, but it has to be done in order to provide for the more important programs. I&#8217;ll hold back additional comments until I see how it&#8217;s done. </p>

<p><b>What is another important issue in your district?</b><br />
Property Taxes, but that&#8217;s money. In some parts of this wide diverse district, it&#8217;s the road conditions, in other parts, it&#8217;s the street parking and then it&#8217;s security and to be able to live in a safe environment.</p>

<p><b>What is different about your approach to that issue?</b><br />
These are issues that need to be worked out with the various neighborhood boards.&nbsp;  </p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
Myself followed by close family and friends.</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your strategy in dealing with the homeless?</b><br />
We need a find a permanent but convenient location. But there are those who do not want shelter.</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
We need the rail but it must be done with better stations. I think it will start in the red, but eventually be self-sustaining. </p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
By making it more convenient for people to vote. This can lead to mass voter fraud. Our current efforts need time to see if it is going to be effective.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii&#8217;s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
During hard times, people just don&#8217;t have the disposable income to spend. In situations like this, tax breaks don&#8217;t help, there just isn&#8217;t enough money circulating around. An infusion of cash?</p>

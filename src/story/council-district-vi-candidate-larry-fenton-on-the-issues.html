<p>HONOLULU&#8212;There are now 10 candidates for Honolulu City Council District 6, as of the Office of Elections Candidate Report on July 23. <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> has submitted the same list of questions to each of the 10 candidates. Responses will be published in the order in which they are received.</p>

<p>District 6 is comprised of a portion of Makiki, Downtown Honolulu, Punchbowl, Liliha, Pauoa Valley, Nuuanu, Alewa Heights, Papakolea, Kalihi Valley, and a portion of greater Kalihi.</p>

<p>Candidate Larry Fenton was first to respond to <i>The Hawaii Independent</i>â€™s questions about the election and the issues facing District 6. Fenton is the vice-chair of the Hawaii Democratic Party Labor Caucus. Fenton was recently arrested with 84 others during a Local 5 union protest at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki.</p>

<p><b>What do you feel is the single most important issue you will face if elected?</b><br />
The single most important issue I would face as a Council member is getting people back to work so they can pay their mortgages and bills. </p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled by the Council presently?</b><br />
I would start dealing with issues regarding right of way, eminent domain, and historical buildings or areas that would interfere with the construction and development of the rail project in District 6. </p>

<p><b>What is another important issue in your District?</b><br />
Another important issue are homeless people living in local neighborhoods and setting up shanty towns in places like Kakaako.</p>

<p><b>What is different about your approach to that issue?</b><br />
I would look at commercial or government buildings not currently being used and convert them for use as &#8220;homeless&#8221; shelters. </p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
My wife is my largest campaign contributor.</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your strategy in dealing with the homeless?</b><br />
A few of our representatives have worked on this issue and come up with the idea of &#8220;safe zones&#8221; for &#8220;homeless&#8221; people to live without being forced to move. I think this is a good start, but the Council needs to take up the issue as well. </p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
I am for the rail project. We have received assurances from gubernatorial candidate Mufi Hannemann as to the soundness of the rail project and adequate financing arrangements. He is in a position to make knowledgeable assessments [about] the City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s ability to pay its share for construction, and of the commitment the federal government has already made. He has stated there is a $1.5 billion cushion for possible cost overruns. Congressman and gubernatorial candidate Neil Abercrombie is also supportive and in favor of building the rail project. </p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
This is a difficult question. There has been a steady drop-off in election participation. I hope I&#8217;ve done my part to energize the population into voting. I&#8217;ve gone door-to-door carrying voter registration forms to constituents in my district and plan on doing more voter outreach in the future.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii&#8217;s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
The only way to help small business is for the local economy to improve. Once we get people back to work, they will be able to spend money again and those local small businesses will come back to prosperity. I am for doing everything I can to make that happen on the Council. </p>

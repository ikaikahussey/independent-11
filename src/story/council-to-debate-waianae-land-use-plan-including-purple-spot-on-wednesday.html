<p>The <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/organizations/honolulu-city-council">Honolulu City Council</a> is set to debate Bill 50, which approves the <a href="http://www.honoluludpp.org/planning/DevSust_Waianae.asp">Waianae Sustainable Communities Plan</a>, on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The council&#8217;s Committee on Zoning and Planning debated elements of the plan for several hours last Thursday. At that meeting, the committee decided to accept the city&#8217;s decision to abandon plans for a regional park serving the Nanakuli ahupuaa. The committee also allowed a &#8220;purple spot&#8221; to remain on the planning map, allowing for industrial development on a 236-acre parcel in Lualualei. Community groups have contended that the parcel should be returned to agricultural use.</p>

<p>The council convenes at 10 am Wednesday at Kapolei Hale. </p>

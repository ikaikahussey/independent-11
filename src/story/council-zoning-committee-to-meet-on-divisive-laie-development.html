<p>LAIE &#8212; The Honolulu City Council Zoning Committee will meet Wednesday, June 1 to take action on <a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-110139/5wdwmx9z.pdf" target="_blank">Resolution 11-84</a> to grant a Special Management Area Use permit for the construction of a four-story, 222-room hotel, the Laie Inn on Kamehameha Highway. The project would include banquet and meeting facilities, a stand-alone McDonald’s fast food restaurant, and two-story commercial building, at the site of the original, 49-room hotel in front of the Polynesian Cultural Center. The original Laie Inn was demolished in early 2010. </p>

<p>The construction is being proposed by Hawaii Reserves, Inc., the company that manages the property for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is to be the first phase of the divisive Envision Laie development plan that affects much of the pastoral, kuleana lands of Koolauloa.</p>

<p>The Council committee had previously deferred action on the resolution, due to concerns over potential litigation against the City by opponents of the proposed development because the Department of Planning and Permitting failed to adequately notify the public about action on the matter.</p>

<p>The committee will take action on conditions of the resolution that address the obligations of the applicant, Hawaii Reserves, Inc., with respect to a community pedestrian-bike path, public beach access, sewage concerns, and pedestrian safety measures.</p>

<p>The public can <a href="http://www.honolulu.gov/council/attnspkzone.htm" target="_blank">register to speak at the meeting</a>, or <a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-113564/AGENDA%20060111%20Spec%20Mtg.Zoning.htm" target="_blank">submit written testimony</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, JUNE 1, 2011<br />
6:00 P.M. – 8:00 P.M.<br />
KAHUKU HIGH SCHOOL, CAFETERIA<br />
56-490 KAMEHAMEHA HIGHWAY, KAHUKU, HAWAII</strong></p>

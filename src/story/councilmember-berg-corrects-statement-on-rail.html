<p><em>HONOLULU&#8212; Honolulu City Councilmember Tom Berg has publicly corrected a statement  he made about Honolulu Authority on Rapid Transit nominees, specifically about electrical union leader nominee Damien Kim:</em></p>

<p>&#8220;In my critique of Mayor Carlisle’s and the City Council leadership’s appointments yesterday, I gave the regrettable impression that the HART nominee Damien Kim – business manager and financial secretary of the IBEW local 1186 – works for the same chapter of the electrical workers union which walked out on my constituents in Ewa Beach and Kapolei during the power outage a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Earlier today, I spoke with Mr. Kim who kindly explained the difference between his Local 1186 and Local 1260 which represents the HECO workers.&nbsp; I regret that my statement lumped these two chapters of IBEW together in a way which made Mr. Kim seem directly responsible for the mid-outage work stoppage.”</p>

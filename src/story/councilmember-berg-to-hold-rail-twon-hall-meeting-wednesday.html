<p>EWA&#8212;Honolulu City Councilmember Tom Berg, a vocal opponent to the Cityâ€™s planned rail transit project, will hold a town meeting to discuss changes to that have developed since the 2008 vote that cleared the way for the project. The meeting will take place Wednesday, June 15 at Ewa Makai Middle School.</p>

<p>Among topics to be discussed include major increases in the cost of the project, the proposed route of the rail line, and the likelihood that the project will actually increase traffic congestion on Oahu.</p>

<p>Dr. Panos Prevedouros, who has announced plans to run for Honolulu mayor in 2012 on an anti-rail platform, will give a special presentation on the potentially perilous impacts of the project. A University of Hawaii Manoa professor of Civil Engineering, Prevedouros has been among the most vocal opponents to rail transit on Oahu.</p>

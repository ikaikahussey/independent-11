<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;The lovely Mrs. Hog of Hog Island BBQ invites patrons to come in and guess how many little piggies are at Hog Island, where your favorite barbecue goodies are fired-up using only 100 percent oak wood. The meats leave the pit having the essence of being cooked over a wood fire, without the “heavy smoke taste” usually associated with barbeque.</p>

<p>Customers have donated a vast array of collectible swine, and whoever guesses correctly will win a free brisket, pork, or chicken plate. In the event of a tie, they will draw up to 4 winners.&nbsp; </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Senate Committee on Judiciary and Government Operations began a confirmation hearing Tuesday on Judge Katherine Leonard, Governor Linda Lingle&#8217;s nominee to be the next Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court. Leonard, who first became a judge in 2008, has an opportunity to be the strongest voice on the highest court in the state for the next decade.</p>

<p>Lingle&#8217;s nomination of Leonard, an Intermediate Court of Appeals associate judge, on July 22.</p>

<p>If confirmed by the State Senate, Leonard would succeed Chief Justice Ronald Moon to become Hawaii’s fifth Chief Justice since statehood. Leonard would be the first graduate of the University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law to be appointed to the Supreme Court and the first woman in Hawaii’s history to be named Chief Justice. She would be the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Leonard would also be among 22 women nationwide who currently serve as chief justice of a state supreme court. </p>

<p>Leonard would serve an initial 10-year term as the head of the State’s highest court and top administrator of the Hawaii Judiciary.</p>

<p>The nomination received support from the Hawaii Women Lawyers, former Hawaii Supreme Court Justice Robert Klein, and lawyer William McCorriston.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Hawaii State Bar Association, however, rated Leonard as &#8220;unqualified.&#8221; <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/hawaiinews/20100803_Judges_unqualified_rating_is_slammed.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+StatelineorgRss-CrimeCourts+(Stateline.org+RSS+-+Crime+%26+Courts)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" title="The Honolulu Star Advertiser reports">The Honolulu Star Advertiser reports</a> on Lingle&#8217;s reaction to the board&#8217;s rating.</p>

<p>Leonard, who turns 51 this month, joined the Intermediate Court of Appeals after Lingle nominated her in 2007 to fill a vacancy created by the death of Associate Judge John Lim. She was confirmed unanimously (23-0) by the Senate and took her seat on January 2008.</p>

<p>Prior to becoming a judge, Leonard was a partner with the law office of Carlsmith Ball LLP from 1992 to 2007 where she concentrated on civil litigation, including commercial, trust, and environmental law. Leonard advised and represented clients in complex litigation and arbitration matters, which included real property, commercial lending, contested trust-related matters, and tax appeal issues. Her clients included lending institutions, trustees of large trusts, and large and small businesses with commercial disputes.</p>

<p>Leonard is a 1991 graduate of the UH William S. Richardson School of Law, where she served as editor-in-chief of the <i>UH Law Review</i>. She earned her undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin, Parkside in 1982.</p>

<p>Following graduation from U.H., Leonard served as a law clerk for former Supreme Court Associate Justice Robert Klein. She also served as a law clerk at the First Circuit Court.</p>

<p>Leonard is a member of the American Judicature Society, an independent, nonpartisan national organization that works to maintain the independence and integrity of the courts and increase public understanding of the justice system. She also participates in the American Bar Association Appellate Judges Conference. She is a member of the American Bar Association and the Hawaii State Bar Association. </p>

<p>Leonard is active in scouting, was an AYSO (American Youth Soccer Association) coach, and has volunteered with the Honolulu Orchid Society. She is married to Ian Sandison and has one son and two stepchildren.</p>

<p>“I am honored and humbled by this appointment and believe I have the capacity, strength, and commitment to handle this prestigious position,” Leonard said in a statement.</p>

<p>Lingle selected Judge Leonard from a list of six candidates that was submitted to her by the Judicial Selection Commission on June 23. All six candidates were interviewed by Lingle as well as a committee made up of members of the governor’s senior staff. The public was invited to submit comments on the six candidates. </p>

<p>According to the Hawaii State Constitution, the Senate has 30 days to confirm or reject the nomination. If the Senate fails to reject the nominee within 30 days, it shall be deemed to have given its consent to the governor’s appointment of Leonard.</p>

<p>During her term in office, Lingle has named three of five justices to the Hawaii Supreme Court, five of six judges to the Intermediate Court of Appeals, and 17 of 33 judges to the Circuit Court.</p>

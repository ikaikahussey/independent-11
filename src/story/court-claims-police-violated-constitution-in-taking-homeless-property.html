<p>The US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has rendered a ruling saying it is unconstitutional for police to confiscate and destroy the property of homeless people, even if it is unattended. The Los Angeles case stems from measures where police would take unattended property and destroy it. Local legal experts say the situation is different from the Honolulu law which only allows police to confiscate belongings after being tagged for 24 hours.</p>

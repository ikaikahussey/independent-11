<p>One of the most significant plays of post-Independence India, <i>Andha Yug</i> takes place on the last day of the Great Mahabharata War. The once-beautiful city of Hastinapur is burning, the battlefield beyond the walls is piled with corpses, and the few survivors huddle together in grief and rage, blaming the destruction on their adversaries, divine capriciousness-anyone or anything except their own moral choices.&nbsp; <i>Andha Yug</i> explores our capacity for moral action, reconciliation, and goodness in times of atrocity and reveals what happens when individuals succumb to the cruelty and cynicism of a blind, dispirited age.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  I suddenly understood<br />
&nbsp;   as if in a flash of revelation<br />
&nbsp;   that when a man<br />
&nbsp;   surrenders his selfhood<br />
&nbsp;   and challenges history<br />
&nbsp;   he can change the course<br />
&nbsp;   of the stars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;   The lines of fate<br />
&nbsp;   are not carved in stone.<br />
&nbsp;   They can be drawn and redrawn<br />
&nbsp;   at every moment of time<br />
&nbsp;   by the will of man.</p>

<p>A hike through a lush tropical valley or a relaxing day on Kaneohe bay are two tours being offered in April by the Koolaupoko Hawaiian <br />
Civic Club.</p>

<p>On April 3, the club will be hosting a hike into Lulumahu Valley, where visitors will learn of the tragic fate that befell some of Oahu&#8217;s people during the battle of Nuuanu.</p>

<p>Criss-crossing Lulumahu Stream, the goal of this hike will be to reach Lulumahu Falls&#8212;a spectacular cascade from the pali Koolau.</p>

<p>This 2.5-hour hike is moderately-challenging, according to Mahealani Cypher, who will be leading the hike. The hike will run from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.</p>

<p>On April 24, the civic club is offering two tours aboard the glassbottom boat in Kaneohe Bay, starting at 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Passengers on the boat will hear the moolelo&#8212;or stories - of the nine ahupuaa around Kaneohe Bay, and hear first-hand from cultural practitioner Jerry Kaluhiwa about ocean resources and the coral reef of the bay.</p>

<p>Both the hike and the tours are limited and advance reservations are required. For reservations and more information, contact the civic club office at 235-8111 or email malamapono@aol.com.</p>

<p>HALEIWA&#8212;Da Hui Backdoor Shootout is on today at Ehukai Beach Park in waves reported to be 10 to 15 feet, or two to three times overhead by <a href="http://Surfline.com" title="Surfline.com">Surfline.com</a>. This is the second day of the 7th annual contest, after the first day being held this past Monday, January 3. </p>

<p>The contest&#8217;s holding period is running from January 3 to January 13. According to <a href="http://DaHui.com" title="DaHui.com">DaHui.com</a>, the contest &#8220;boasts the most participation of Hawaii born surfers.&#8221; The contest utilizes a unique judging format which involves three rounds of no elimination, four man heats and each surfer&#8217;s best three waves are scored. </p>

<p>the teams entered this year are Da Hui, Quiksilver, Oakley, Hurley, Red Bull, Billabong, Volcom, and North Shore Boys. Hawaii&#8217;s Jamie O&#8217;Brien won last year, with Pancho Sullivan of the North Shore winning in 2004, the last time the contest was held. </p>

<p>Surfline reported that the occasional 18-foot waves are expected to come through the infamous North Shore surf spot, and is calling conditions &#8220;good to epic&#8221; with a new west-north-west swell topping out in the morning with light east veering wind. </p>

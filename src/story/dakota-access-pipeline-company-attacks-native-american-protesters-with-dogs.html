<p>On September 3, the Dakota Access pipeline company attacked Native Americans with dogs and pepper spray as they protested against the $3.8 billion pipeline&#8217;s construction. If completed, the pipeline would carry about 500,000 barrels of crude per day from North Dakotaâ€™s Bakken oilfield to Illinois. The project has faced months of resistance from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of nearly 100 more tribes from across the U.S. and Canada.</p>

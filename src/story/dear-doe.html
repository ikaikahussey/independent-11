<p>A longtime Farrington high school teacher is retiring from service there because recent Department of Education (DOE) policy reforms have led to an increase in interference and top-down policies, making it impossible for her to continue teaching effectively. Judy Sadoyama writes, on her <a href="http://jsadoyama.blogspot.com/2014/05/dear-doe.html?m=1">blog</a>, a farewell letter to the DOE, outlining her reasons for leaving:</p>

<blockquote><p>Today I end a 24-year teaching career.&nbsp; It’s not because I can officially retire—I have enough years of service but not age.&nbsp; It’s not because of ill health—thank goodness.&nbsp; It’s not because I don’t like my job—I’m passionate about teaching and since I was a high school sophomore, it’s the only career I ever thought to pursue.&nbsp; It’s not because I don’t have good colleagues—I have the best team on campus. It’s not because I don’t like my students—I think I relate well to them and I truly care about them.</p>

<p>After 24 years, I am leaving because the DOE is making it impossible for me to stay.&nbsp; As a teacher, I knew I would be subject to a top-heavy bureaucracy and there would be cumbersome policies that I would be called upon to implement. I’ve seen a lot of change in the two-plus decades I’ve been at Farrington (my alma mater, by the way) and though I didn’t always like the policies, I was always willing to roll with it and give it a try.</p>

<p>Not anymore.</p>

<p>The system is abusive to its teachers and the worst part of it is it is the better teachers who are most affected by this abuse.&nbsp; Bad teachers go on doing what they always do:&nbsp; NOTHING.&nbsp; They don’t relate well to the kids, they ride on the coattails of their colleagues and when called to task, they plead ignorance.&nbsp; They must do it well because there are too many of them and they make the same amount of money, or more, than I do.</p>

<p>Yet it’s never been about the monetary angle for me.&nbsp; It’s the inconsistencies and the contradictions; rather than take care of these “educators,” the system passes policies across the board; policies that make more work for the good teachers who are conscientious professionals and policies that don’t truly serve the population they claim to:&nbsp; the students. </p>

<p>Dear DOE, I am tired of you.&nbsp; I am tired of you poking your nose into my classroom and telling me what you think is best for my kids. And they truly are “my” kids.&nbsp; I am the one who identifies their weaknesses and tailors my teaching to them.&nbsp; I am the one who challenges them to excel and holds them to a standard that is high, but realistic. I see them as the individuals they are and you judge them based on STANDARDIZED tests?&nbsp; How dare you!</p>

<p>Though I would like to say that I am personally unlike the DOE, I’m afraid that’s not true.&nbsp; You see I, too, have STANDARDS, professional and personal standards that do not agree with the changes being made.&nbsp; I refuse to be a part of anything I cannot support.&nbsp; I refuse to go through the motions.&nbsp; And, I refuse to put aside my personal values for the sake of a job.&nbsp; </p>

<p>People keep asking me if I’m sad.&nbsp; Of course I am.&nbsp; I will miss teaching and I will certainly miss my kids. But mostly, I am sad that it had to come to this; teaching should have been my only career.</p>

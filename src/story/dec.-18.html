<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

<p>In a week marked with setbacks on <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/hi-lighter/negotiators-abandon-furlough-talks/">furloughs</a>, the state deficit, and a resolution to the <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/local/read/Kailua/bill-7-defeated-in-council-vote-today/">B&amp;B debate</a>, we&#8217;ve made some progress. We&#8217;ve launched a <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/masthead">Masthead</a> page, with contact info and biographies for most of our writers, plus an ongoing blog where I&#8217;ll be documenting the growth of our paper. Travis Quezon is writing about our editorial process on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Hawaii-Independent/58537286531">Facebook page</a>. Be sure to check out Barb Forsyth&#8217;s piece on <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/lifestyle/shop-smart-shop-local-from-hawaiis-own-holiday-gamut/">localcentric holiday shopping</a>. Indigenous Pacific voices have been represented in <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/world/read/indigenous-peoples-make-progress-in-climate-talks/">Copenhagen</a>. And finally, we&#8217;re building a slate of in-depth reports for the new year, and would like your input on stories you&#8217;d like covered. Mahalo for your feedback and your support!</p>

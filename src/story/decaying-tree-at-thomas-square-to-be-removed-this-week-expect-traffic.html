<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A severely decayed Earpod tree at Thomas Square will be removed beginning Monday, October 11 to protect public safety, the City and County of Honolulu announced. Work is expected to take several days and affect parking and traffic in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>The tree, located near the corner of South King and Victoria streets, was inspected by an arborist who determined that its trunk and major limbs have been badly weakened and could break. </p>

<p>In anticipation of the need to remove the damaged tree, the Division of Urban Forestry planted two Leopard trees in the vicinity several months ago. The Division will also soon plant a Monkeypod tree nearby.</p>

<p>The three replacement trees will match a planting in the square near the corner of South King Street and Ward Avenue, where another damaged Earpod tree was removed several years ago.</p>

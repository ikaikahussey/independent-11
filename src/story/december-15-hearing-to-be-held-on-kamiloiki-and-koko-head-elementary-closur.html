<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Rep. Gene Ward (R&#8212;Hawaii Kai-Kalama Valley) recently appealed to Gov. Neil Abercrombie and members of the Board of Education (BOE) to postpone any decision on the future of Koko Head Elementary School and Kamiloiki Elementary School until a permanent board is appointed.</p>

<p>The implementation of an appointed board was one of Abercrombie’s priority campaign items. Ward is concerned that the present elected BOE may make a decision on the possible closure of a Hawaii Kai school as early as January 2011, once a recommendation is received from the Superintendent Kathryn Matayoshi.</p>

<p>“It would be entirely unfair, unorthodox, and borderline unethical for the BOE to ramrod a school closure as one of its last acts of business before they are overshadowed by the appointed board,” Ward said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Kamiloiki and Koko Head Elementary School stakeholders have shown overwhelming support to keep their schools open by protesting along Kalanianaole Highway as well as showing up at past information hearings. A formal hearing on a possible school closure will be held Wednesday, December 15 at 6:30 p.m. at Kaiser High School.</p>

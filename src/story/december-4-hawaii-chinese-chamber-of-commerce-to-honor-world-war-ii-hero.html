<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Hawaii&#8217;s <a href="http://www.chinesechamber.com/" title="Chinese Chamber of Commerce">Chinese Chamber of Commerce</a> will host an event remembering and honoring Medal of Honor recipient, the late Francis Brown Wai, at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, December 4th, 2010. Captain Francis Brown Wai was killed in action on October 20, 1944, the first day of the invasion of Leyte Island in the Visayas group of the Philippines.</p>

<p>In 1996, amid allegations of prejudicial treatment of Asian-Americans in uniform in World War II, Congress directed Louis Caldera, then-Secretary of the Army, to conduct a full review of military records. The review concluded that 22 Asian-Americans, including Wai, of Honolulu, did not receive full consideration for the Medal of Honor. In 2000, Wai&#8217;s Distinguished Service Cross was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. Of those whose medals were upgraded, Wai was one of only two who did not belong to the predominantly Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team/100th Infantry Battalion, the other being Rudolph B. Davila of the 7th Infantry Regiment. </p>

<p>At a White House ceremony on June 20, 2000, President Bill Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to seven of the 22 Asian-Americans who were still alive or to their families.</p>

<p>While most Honolulu residents would not recognize his name, some of our older residents may remember Wai, who was a multiple-sport letterman at Punahou School, Sacramento Junior College, and UCLA. Those attending the Chamber&#8217;s presentation featuring his two brothers will have an opportunity to learn more about this largely unknown Chinese-American hero, born, raised, and educated in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Wai was the first-born son of a Native Hawaiian mother and a Chinese father. Growing up, he often surfed with Duke Kahanamoku, regarded as the father of surfing, and Buster Crabbe, who later became an actor. At Punahou School in Honolulu, Wai earned athletic letters in track, football, and baseball.&nbsp; Following graduation in 1935, he attended Sacramento Junior College, then transferred to UCLA in 1937. At UCLA, he was a four-sport athlete and graduated in 1939 with a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Banking and Finance.</p>

<p>After graduation, Wai enlisted in the Hawaii National Guard. The National Guard was federalized in 1940-41. Upon completion of Officer Candidate School in 1941, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. His commission was rare at a time when few Asian-Americans were allowed to serve in combat leadership roles. He was assigned t the 24th Infantry Divisionâ€™s 34th Infantry Regiment. The 24th Infantry, based at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, was among the first American units to be involved in the Pacific war, its soldiers exchanging fire with Japanese aircraft during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Promoted to captain, in May 1943, Wai deployed to Australia with the 24th Infantry. After completion of intensive combat training, the division left for Goodenough Island, Dutch New Guinea, on January 31, 1944, to prepare for Operation Reckless, the amphibious invasion of Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea.&nbsp; The division landed at Tanahmerah Bay on April 19, 1944, and seized the Hollandia airfield. Shortly after the Hollandia landing, Wai and the 34th Infantry Regiment moved to the island of Biak to reinforce the 41st Infantry Division. Wai&#8217;s regiment captured the Sorido and Borokoe airfields before rejoining to the division on Hollandia in July.</p>

<p>After occupying the Hollandia area, the 24th Infantry Division was assigned to X Corps of the Sixth United States Army in preparation for the invasion of the Philippines. On October 20, 1944, the X Corps, comprised of the 24th Infantry and the 1st Cavalry Divisions, made an assault landing at Leyte. The 24th Division landed at Red Beach while the 1st Cavalry landed at White Beach, some 1,500 yards to the north. At Red Beach, Japanese forces were initially surprised, but soon recovered to concentrate their mortar and machine gun fire on the waves of incoming troops.</p>

<p>When CPT Wai arrived on Red Beach in the fifth wave, he found the soldiers in the immediate area to be leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach. Assuming command of the soldiers around him, he moved through the rice paddies. His demeanor and example inspired the other men to follow him. With deliberate disregard for his own personal safety, he repeatedly advanced without cover to draw Japanese machine gun and rifle fire, thus exposing the locations of the entrenched Japanese forces. Systematically, the Japanese positions were assaulted and overcome. CPT Wai was killed leading an assault against the last Japanese pillbox in the area. For his actions during the landing on Leyte, CPT Wai was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After the war, his remains were interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. His grave can be found in section Q, grave 1194.</p>

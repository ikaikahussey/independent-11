<p>A nuclear radiation workshop at the Honolulu Friends Meeting House in Manoa intends to enlighten Hawaii residents on the science of nuclear power.</p>

<p>The event comes as a remembrance of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the dozens of nuclear tests in the Pacific, and the recent Fukushima nuclear disaster. In Hawaii, the discovery of depleted uranium on Oahu and Hawaii Island heightens the need for people to learn about how to protect against the effects of nuclear radiation and decipher the information presented by the nuclear industry.</p>

<p>Physics educator and peace activist Lynda Williams will lead the workshop, covering basic atomic physics and the health effects of nuclear power and ionizing radiation. </p>

<p>Williams is physics faculty at Santa Rosa Junior College in California and a board member of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space. A long time peace and anti-nuclear activist and educator, Williams strives to demystify science in order to enlighten and empower people.</p>

<p>The Nuclear Radiation Workshop is sponsored by AFSC Hawaii, Hawaii Peace and Justice, <a href="http://www.dmzhawaii.org/" target="_blank">DMZ-Hawaii</a>, Aloha Aina, and the <a href="http://www.space4peace.org" target="_blank">Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space</a>. The event is free and welcome to all.</p>

<p><b>Nuclear Radiation Workshop: Demystifying the Science and Uncovering the Lies<br />
Wednesday, August 3 from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.<br />

<p>After several years of record high enrollment, the number of students at the University of Hawaii&#8217;s 10-campus system dropped this fall to 59,288, echoing an overall national decline in college attendance in 2012. The university said 1,345 fewer students enrolled for the current semester, down 2.2 percent from last fall. The decrease, UHâ€ˆsaid, follows record-breaking enrollments in each of the last five years. Enrollment had grown by 17 percent since 2007.</p>

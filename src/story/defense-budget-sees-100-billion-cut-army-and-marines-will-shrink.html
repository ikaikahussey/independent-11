<p>The U.S. Defense budget is seeing a major $100 billion cut, the most significant cut post-9/11. The cut means Army and Marines forces will shrink. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Defense budget signals the close of &#8220;endless money&#8221; for post-9/11 spending. Some cuts will be reinvested in the military, others will go to deficit reduction. <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0106/Defense-budget-to-cut-100-billion-Army-and-Marines-will-shrink?cmpid=addthis_facebook&amp;sms_ss=facebook&amp;at_xt=4d264bedb261be5f,0" title="The Christian Science Monitor reports.">The Christian Science Monitor reports.</a></p>

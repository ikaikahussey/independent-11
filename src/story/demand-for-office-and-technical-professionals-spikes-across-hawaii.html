<p>ALTRES Office/Professional and ALTRES Technical, divisions of ALTRES Staffing, Hawaii’s largest human resources organization, announced today a significant spike in demand for office and technical professionals across all islands. While the state continues to experience unemployment rates at record lows, Hawaii’s available workforce is thinning out. ALTRES is looking to fill nearly 140 positions on Oahu, Maui and the Big Island.</p>

<p>“Gone are the days of the overabundance of candidates we experienced during the 2008 to 2010 recession,” said Manager Emy Yamauchi-Wong, CSP of ALTRES Staffing. “It is a great time for those who already have a job and may not be actively looking to explore and see what else is out there. If you’re feeling stifled at your current job or seeking change, now is the time to do it.” <br />
 <br />
According to the Hawaii State Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for December 2014 was 4.0 percent, compared to the national unemployment rate of 5.6 percent.<br />

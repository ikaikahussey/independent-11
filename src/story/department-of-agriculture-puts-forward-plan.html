<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii Department of Agriculture has posted a draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for the release of a natural predator (Tectococcus ovatus, a Brazilian scale insect) for the sustainable management of strawberry guava in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This action is proposed to mitigate the impacts of strawberry guava on native forests, the water supply, and agriculture.&nbsp;   </p>

<p>The draft EA is available in the Environmental Notice on the Hawaii Department of Healthâ€™s Office of Environmental Quality Control (OEQC) website and will be open for public comment through July 23.</p>

<p>Only written comments will be accepted, and may be submitted to the Hawaii Department of Agriculture Plant Pest Control Branch at 1428 S. King St. Honolulu, HI  96814, with a copy sent to the Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Forestry and Wildlife, 1151 Punchbowl Street, Room 325, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813; or emailed to hdoa.ppc@hawaii.gov. </p>

<p>Opponents to an introduction of the insect say there are alternatives, such as increased harvesting and utilization of the strawberry guava plant as a resource for wood chips, biofuel, and fruit and becoming an important part of food and fuel self-sufficiency. According to Biodamage.com, there is the risk of the insect mutating and adapting to attack other plant species.</p>

<p>Conservationists say strawberry guava, when left unchecked, is one of the most aggressive invasive species in Hawaii today and has been responsible for severe damage to Hawaii&#8217;s native species for generations.</p>

HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;If you take promotional materials at face value, the road to a greener tomorrow starts with the Department of Hawaiian Homelands Lai Opua project.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Lai Opua is a 100-unit village under construction on part of 720 acres of land in Kealakehe on Hawaii Island’s west side. The site of the village is above Kealakehe High School and Honokohau Boat Harbor. The community features standard single-family homes provided by Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL).</p>

<p>Kona residents, however, say that the project is destroying the dryland area, which is home to endangered native species.</p>

<p>DHHL intends to use the project as a sustainable model for future sites. The homes will be equipped with photovoltaic and solar water heating panels to reduce the consumption of electricity coming from the grid. They are also structured to take advantage of the wind, with windows located and sized to increase natural ventilation. </p>

<p>Outside the homes, specially constructed driveways will be made of pervious concrete, a surface that allows water to run down driveways onto the landscape. The developers point to this technology as one of the features that will make Lai Opua a modern-day ahupuaa. Other features contributing to the ahupuaa concept include the promotion of community farming, the Hale Community Center, and the “story time” area where kupuna (grandparents) can share their manao with the children of the community and restore a connection to old Hawaii.</p>

<p>Kaulana Park, the chairman of DHHL said in a statement: “We are continuing to build upon our foundation of being a master-planned community developer by capitalizing on energy efficient technology. We have always built affordable homes, and now we are building homes that are energy-efficient.”</p>

<p>Local organizations with an interest in self-sufficiency, such as Kamehameha Schools, Kaula Farms, and The Queen Liliuokalani Foundation, will assist community members in achieving the goal of producing their own food, according to plans. Understanding it may be several years before the families in Lai Opua will be sufficient on their own, the planners have established a two-year window for local practitioners to teach classes and give other forms of support. </p>

<p>Lai Opua is the first self-sufficient community project DHHL hopes to build, but it is not the agency’s only plan for this type of development. Park discussed the project during an  “Energy Futures” broadcast with Donalyn Dela Cruz on KIPO Radio last month. He stated that the department hopes Lai Opua will be the proving ground for larger projects. If everything goes well with Lai Opua, then DHHL will go on with the Kau Puni project in Waianae on the island of Oahu. The plan is to build Kau Puni on 300 acres where it will be the department’s first large-scale, self-sufficient community. </p>

<p>During the live broadcast on KIPO, Park also revealed a plan by DHHL to have a program that will educate people (buyers, contractors, etc.) to use efficient appliances that would help ease impacts on the environment at an inexpensive price.</p>

<p>“We are fulfilling our commitment to provide those on the wait list an opportunity for homeownership through this program that allows the lessee time to prepare to be homeowners,” Park said in a statement.</p>

<p>As of now, 45 families have been offered a home in Lai Opua. The 300-acre project in Kealakehe is aimed to be finished in December 2010, according to Park, who also said the families are eager to be a part of the community&#8212;one which he believes will change the way the world lives.</p>

<p>Despite the progress for DHHL, there are still concerns with negative environmental impacts. According to the project’s site and house plans available at the <a href="http://www.armstrongbuilders.com/main/laiopua.html" title="Armstrong Builders website">Armstrong Builders website</a>, there are only 45 units which will be equipped with green features. Armstrong Builders will serve as the contractor for the project. These 45 houses are part of an overall community of 4,263 homes scheduled for construction in the area. </p>

<p>Chuck Flaherty of Apono Hawaii is a member of the Kona community with a longstanding involvement in development related issues there. (Apono Hawaii is a sponsor of the <i>Youth News for The Hawaii Independent</i> project.) Flaherty had this to say: “Bottom line is [45] supposedly green homes out of 4,263 is a joke.”</p>

<p>Flaherty expressed his concern with <i>Youth News</i> over the damage DHHL is inflicting on the natural dryland forests in the vicinity of Lai Opua. In the area, there are five dryland forest species no longer located anywhere else in the world. Flaherty said that dividing the forests into smaller areas is damaging to the ecosystem. Flahert is concerned that endangered trees are still coming down. </p>

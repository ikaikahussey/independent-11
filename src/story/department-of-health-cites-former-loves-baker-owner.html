<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Last week, the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) issued a Notice of Violation and Order against First Baking Co., Ltd. (the former owner and operator of Love’s Bakery) for the following alleged underground storage tank (UST) violations:</p>

<p>1. Failure to notify DOH of a suspected release within 24 hours of discovering evidence of a release. A penalty of $50,000 has been imposed for this violation.</p>

<p>2. Failure to notify DOH of ownership and installation of a new UST. The current tank systems were installed in 1989 and the Department of Health was not notified of their existence until March 2009. A penalty of $50,000 has been imposed for these violations.</p>

<p>Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 11-281 requires UST owners and/or operators to report a suspected release at a UST site within 24 hours of discovering evidence of a release. The law also requires owners and operators to submit a notification of ownership and installation of new USTs. First Baking Co., Ltd. may request a hearing to contest the allegations or order.</p>

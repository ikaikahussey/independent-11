<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The rehabilitation of the Kinau Street H-1 off-ramp began Monday, August 8 and is expected to impact traffic in the area. </p>

<p>The project includes reconstruction and resurfacing of the asphalt roadway, replacing curbs and gutters, adjustment of manhole frames and covers, replacement of pavement markings and installing traffic signal loop detectors.</p>

<p>The resurfacing work is being done from the end of the H-1 off-ramp to Waiau Place, east of Keeaumoku Street. Work hours are Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. through the end of October.</p>

<p>Motorists are advised to use alternate routes as the work will result in detours and lane closures. If drivers cannot avoid the area, they are advised to exercise caution and obey all construction signs and traffic controls. </p>

<p>The intersections at Piikoi and Keeaumoku Streets are excluded though traffic will still be affected as equipment must enter these intersections to complete paving on Kinau Street.</p>

<p>The project will cost $1 million and covers 3.7 lane miles.<br /></p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Diamond Head Theatre was the recipient of two grants to repair and replace cushioning on the theatre seats. </p>

<p>McInerny Foundation (Bank of Hawaii, Trustee) awarded a grant of $7,500 and Atherton Family Foundation awarded a grant of $10,000. “The cushions on our seats were in terrible shape, so we are pleased to offer our patrons comfortable seating once again,&#8221; said Deena Dray, the theater&#8217;s executive director. “These generous foundations helped make it happen.”</p>

<p>Heralded as the &#8220;Broadway of the Pacific,&#8221; Diamond Head Theatre has delivered community theatrical entertainment since 1915. The theatre showcases Hawaii&#8217;s local talent, frequently brings in guest artists, and supports performance arts education through a variety of community programs, including the acclaimed Shooting Stars.</p>

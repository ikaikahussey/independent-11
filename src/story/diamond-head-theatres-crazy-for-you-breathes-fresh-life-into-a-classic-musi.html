<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Diamond Head Theatre&#8217;s (DHT) <i>Crazy For You</i> is a rollicking romp through Depression-era New York and Nevada. It&#8217;s a Gershwin musical, so you can expect big tap dancing numbers overflowing with jazz-hands flair. DHT&#8217;s rendition combines first-rate choreography with solid comedic performances that transport the viewer to the 1930s while managing to stay current in its sensibility.</p>

<p>This blend of old-fashioned charm and cultural relevance perhaps owes itself to the fact that <i>Crazy For You</i> is best described, in the words of DHT director John Rampage, as a “new old musical.” The original musical from 1930 upon which it was based, entitled <i>Girl Crazy</i>, was written by George and Ira Gerswhin and was the hit that catapulted Ginger Rogers to stardom. It was also adapted into a 1943 film starring Judy Garland.</p>

<p>The current production, which includes a longer score incorporating other classic Gerswhin tunes, is a revival that debuted in 1992 at the Shubert Theatre on Broadway, in New York. In writing about the opening night performance, <a href="http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;res=9E0CEEDE173BF933A15751C0A964958260" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> reviewer, Frank Rich, declared that “When future historians try to find the exact moment at which Broadway finally rose up to grab the musical back from the British, they just may conclude that the revolution began last night ... A riotously entertaining show called <i>Crazy for You</i> uncorked the American musical&#8217;s classic blend of music, laughter, dancing, sentiment and showmanship with a freshness and confidence rarely seen.”</p>

<p>I can only imagine what the Broadway performance, choreographed by Susan Stroman, would have been like, but DHT’s rendition, choreographed by Caryn Yee, is fast-paced, high-energy, and enormously amusing. Everything from the singing, to the dancing, to the costumes, and stage set are ambitious for a regional theater, and their impressive results do not disappoint.</p>

<p>The story begins in New York City, where the rich Bobby Childs, played by the talented visiting NYC actor <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/9-21-bf-diamond-head-theatre-offers-two-special-workshops-with-broadway-per/" title="David Spangenthal">David Spangenthal</a>, tries to impress Bela Zangler, of the Zangler Follies, with his tap-dancing prowess. He fails to impress.&nbsp; Dejected, he is sent to Deadrock, Nevada by his mother to wrap up some banking business&#8212;to carry out the foreclosure of a theater. Upon arrival, he falls for the spunky Polly Baker, daughter of the theater owner and the only woman left in the depressed coal-mining town, played by Kathryn Mariko Lee. In the theater, he sees an opportunity to carry out his dancing dreams, as well as win Polly’s heart. However, Polly is quickly turned off by Bobby when she learns he is connected to the foreclosure, so Bobby disguises himself as the famous Zangler to carry out his plan. The story goes from there ...</p>

<p>The plot is somewhat thin, but ripe with opportunities for a constant stream of dizzying duets, ersatz shoot-me-ups, and colorful ensemble numbers, punctuated by accents of physical comedy. In a word, this play is fun. </p>

<p>The last number of the first act, the catchy “I Got Rhythm,” is one of those songs you don’t want to end&#8212;the cast imbues it with so much fresh energy and ingenuity! Their incorporation of utilitarian items as instruments&#8212;toilet plungers, bike pumps, washboards&#8212;introduce an element of surprise to the well-known jazz standard. It&#8217;s a Wild West meets 21st century avant garde percussion experiment.&nbsp; </p>

In this comical scene, the two Zanglers drink away their sorrows, each believing the other is his mirror image." /></p>

<p>The lighthearted fun continues into the second act, with Liz Stone’s hilarious “Naughty Baby” and the slapstick comedy of the two drunk Zanglers lamenting their lost loves in a mirror-image performance of “What Causes That.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>The tremendous fine-feathered showgirl headdresses of the Zangler Follies’ closing act are mere icing on this sensory delight of a cake.</p>

<p>Just as the show would have been an escape from the hard times of the Great Depression, when the original <i>Girl Crazy</i> debuted, <i>Crazy For You </i>offers carefree relief from the financial pressures our current recession. I almost guarantee you’ll still be bopping along when you leave the theater. And with tickets starting as low as $12, roughly comparable to that at a movie theater, and no bad seats in the house, there is no consumer guilt. Instead, you will feel like you are getting real bang for your entertainment buck.&nbsp; </p>

<p><i>The run of Crazy for You has been extended through October 17. To purchase tickets, call (808) 733-0274 or visit the box office, located at 520 Makapuu Avenue, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Saturdays.</i></p>

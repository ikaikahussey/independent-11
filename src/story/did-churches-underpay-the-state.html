<p>Out of five churches being sued, three are New Hope ministries: New Hope Oahu, Hawaii Kai, and Kapolei. </p>

<blockquote><p>The lawsuit claims the churches filed false statements, under-representing their use of state facilities. New Hope used Farrington High School&#8217;s auditorium for its weekend services before moving to its Sand Island location after the auditorium&#8217;s roof caved in last fall. The lawsuit accuses the churches of not paying $5.6 million to the state.</p>

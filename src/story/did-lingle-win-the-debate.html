"teaser":"John Hart, HPU Communications Chair, as quoted by KHON: <blockquote> \"I thought in terms of the closing statements, Mazie's statement was quite good at summarizing her best argument, which is she thinks most people in Hawaii agree with her. So not in terms of who should be the better senator, not in terms of who I would vote for or you should vote for, but if you ask me who won this debate? Linda Lingle won this debate this evening,\" said Hart. </blockquote>",

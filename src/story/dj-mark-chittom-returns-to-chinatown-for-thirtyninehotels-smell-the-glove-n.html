<p>Smell the Glove is thirtyninehotel’s New Year’s Eve offering on Friday night, a celebration of &#8216;70s and &#8216;80s heavy metal. For the uninitiated, Smell the Glove is the title of Spinal Tap’s new record in the seminal 1984 mockumentary <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i>, at which a young (and then bearable) Fran Drescher takes serious offense.</p>

<p>The featured talent for the NYE celebration will be DJ Mark Chittom, the one-time master of the Downtown spin scene and lauded <i>Honolulu Weekly</i> wiseguy who now resides in New York City. It should be a particularly warm homecoming.</p>

<p>The event will offer complimentary pupus by Chef Jamal, and a balloon drop and complimentary champagne toast at midnight. The outdoor patio at thirtyninehotel provides a fine view of the fireworks at Aloha Tower. Attendees are encouraged to dress their metal best.</p>

<p>DJ Mark Farina will perform at Nextdoor on Friday, February 18, a venue committed to bringing world-class House, hip-hop, funk, and indie music to Honolulu. Farina is famous for sometimes spinning 8-hour sets of his trademark “Mushroom Jazz” house music at the most exclusive clubs in the world. Indeed, after his one-night-only Honolulu show, he will whisk off to Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Jakarta for a mini-tour of South Asia before returning to the United States for another run of shows.</p>

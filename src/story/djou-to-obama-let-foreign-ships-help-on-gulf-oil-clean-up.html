Charles Djou becoming the latest member of Congress to publicly criticize President Barack Obama for not allowing foreign ships into the Gulf of Mexico to help with the clean-up effort of the BP oil spill.</p>

<p>“I agree with the president that our nation’s top priority in addressing the Gulf accident is to stop the leak, clean up the mess and hold BP accountable. I am disappointed, however, that the president has failed to waive the Jones Act for foreign ships, who want to assist in the clean-up efforts,” said Djou in a statement. “There is no good reason to turn away international help in responding to this environmental catastrophe.”</p>

<p>HONOLULU, Hawaii&#8212;Republicans were able to make a statement to Democrats with a temporary victory in Hawaii by picking up a Congressional seat in Saturday&#8217;s special election.</p>

<p>Republican Charles Djou, a Honolulu City Council member, was declared the winner of the special election after taking 39.5 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have sent a message that this Congressional seat is not owned by any political party,&#8221; Djou said upon hearing the results at his campaign headquarters. &#8220;It is not owned by any union. It is not owned by any special interest group. This Congressional seat is owned by the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The victory is primarily symbolic as Republicans would still need to gain 40 Democratic seats in November to take control of the 435-member House. </p>

<p>Hawaii has traditionally been a Democratic state, despite currently having a two-term Republican governor. The &#8220;Aloha State&#8221; is also the birth place of Hawaii&#8217;s most famous political son, President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Djou will fill the House seat left vacant by Democrat Neil Abercrombie, an 11-term veteran who resigned to run for Hawaii&#8217;s governor this year.</p>

<p>The GOP introduced national funding into Djou&#8217;s campaign, helping to make him the favorite to win over two Democratic heavyweights&#8212;former Congressman Ed Case and state Senate President Colleen Hanabusa&#8212;who had split the party&#8217;s vote.</p>

<p>Hanabusa earned 52,445 votes (30.8 percent), Case earned 47,012 votes (27.6 percent).</p>

<p>Under Hawaii special election rules, all candidates run on a single ballot regardless of party.</p>

<p>Democratic leaders said they are setting their sights on winning the seat back in November, when they can rally behind one candidate.</p>

<p>Djou will fill Abercrombie&#8217;s unexpired term, which ends on January 3, 2011.</p>

<p>The Department of Land and Natural Resources is recommending that the commercial permit for a Big Island company be cancelled after concluding its investigation of the July 4th incident that resulted in the death of 15 year old Tyler Madoff. DLNR found that Hawaii Pack and Paddle, the company guiding the tour Madoff was on when he and another boy were swept out to sea at Kealakekua Bay had exceeded its permit by bringing 13 customers, instead of the 12 allotted. Owner and Tour Guide Bari Mims plans to challenge the revocation.</p>

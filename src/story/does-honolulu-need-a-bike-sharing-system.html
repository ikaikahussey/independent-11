<p>Across an ocean and a continent, the residents of New York City have a a new bicycle sharing program. For a $95 annual membership fee, members can tool around the city, zigging around yellow taxis and zagging around pedestrians. Our friends at New York Magazine have a round-up of &#8220;<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/05/citibike-reviews-bike-share-pros-cons.html">What Everyone Likes and Dislikes About Citibike So Far</a>.&#8221; The highlights? Docking the bike can be a challenge; it&#8217;s a good thing there&#8217;s an app, but sometimes it sucks; and apparently a lot of people aren&#8217;t good bike riders. </p>

<p>These are all probably valid complaints – complaints which should be instructive for Honolulu, which may soon be the home for a fellow bike sharing program. A Honolulu bike tour is in the works for mid-June, and the city&#8217;s Department of Planning and Permitting will be kicking off a study shortly on how a bike share program could work here.</p>

<p>And hey – if Manhattan Island can do it, so can O‘ahu.</p>

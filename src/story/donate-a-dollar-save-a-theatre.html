<p>HONOLULU&#8212;They say a picture is worth a thousand words. For artist, activist, and stage performer D. Tafa&#8217;i &#8220;Fa&#8217;i&#8221; Silipa, it&#8217;s worth one more dollar toward saving a piece of theatre history.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re on the streets of Chinatown on Thursday, December 23 from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., there&#8217;s a chance your aloha will be captured on film. Silipa will be accepting dollars off the street as part of &#8220;Donate a Dollar, Save a Theatre&#8221;&#8212;an artistic attempt to raise awareness about Hawaii&#8217;s houseless and to raise money for the Kumu Kahua Theatre, which is facing possible closure.</p>

<p>Silipa will be incognito, performing as one of Honolulu&#8217;s houseless, while a photographer will capture images of strangers giving money, food, clothes, and other handouts. If you&#8217;re in the area and happen to see Silipa, stop and say, &#8220;Talofa!&#8221; Feel free to give more for more photos.</p>

<p>Photos may be of just your hand (if you prefer) or a full body shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Donate a Dollar, Save a Theatre&#8221; begins at The Manifest, 32 North Hotel Street Honolulu, and moves freely throughout Chinatown. </p>

<p>&#8220;I decided to concentrate this impromptu benefit around Kumu Kahua Theatre,&#8221; Silipa said. &#8220;I will donate a portion of all proceeds made this day, if any, to Kumu Kahua Theatre, where I made my community theatre debut in a S?moan play in 2006.&#8221;</p>

<p>Due to severe cuts in State funding, Kumu Kahua Theatreâ€™s latest spring production, <i>Da Kine Space</i>, may be its last. The theater has initiated a slew of cost-cutting measures and raised its ticket prices for the first time in 10 years, yet the severe reduction in funding could force the theatre to close its doors in February.</p>

<p>Silipa was first a part of Albert Wendt&#8217;s <i><a href="http://www.kumukahua.org/05songmakermain.html" title="The Songmaker's Chair">The Songmaker&#8217;s Chair</a></i> in 2006 and performed in <i>Ala Wai</i>, <i>Living Pidgin</i> and other plays at Kumu Kahua Theatre. Since making his start at Kumu Kahua Theatre, like many Hawaii actors before him, Silipa has gone on to become a regular performer at Downtown&#8217;s improv shows and other theatre venues.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goal is to raise $100 in cash, food, and clothes,&#8221; Silipa said. &#8220;So stop by for a couple minutes. We sure could use your mana in an effort to help keep Kumu Kahua Theatre from closing it&#8217;s doors for good.&#8221;</p>

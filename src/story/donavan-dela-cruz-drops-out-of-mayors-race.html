<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Councilman Donavan Dela Cruz announced today that he is dropping out of the Honolulu mayor&#8217;s race due to a lack of funding for his campaign. Dela Cruz, who currently represents City Council District 2, will instead be pursuing the vacant State senate seat being left by Sen. Robert Bunda, who is running for lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like many people who have fallen on economic hardships, my campaign for mayor has also felt the financial pinch. Looking at this mayoral race realistically, and being honest with myself and all of you, I have decided to take a different path,&#8221; Dela Cruz said in a statement to his supporters. &#8220;I have decided that the best way I can serve the public is by running for the vacant State senate seat being left by Sen. Bobby Bunda. It is in the district that I currently represent as councilman. If elected, I can continue to serve my community and state in a significant and constructive manner. I intend to run my senate campaign with the same vigor, based on a strong grassroots effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>In July, the first key endorsements by various union groups were made for Honolulu mayoral candidates.</p>

<p>Dela Cruz&#8217;s announcement comes days after acting Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who is also running for mayor, received endorsements from the Hawaii Fire Fighters Association as well as an endorsement from The State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers earlier this month. Caldwell was the managing director for former Mayor Mufi Hannemann, who resigned to run for Hawaii governor.</p>

<p>Also this month, mayoral candidate and former City Prosecuting Attorney Peter Carlisle received an endorsement from the Hawaii Carpenters Union.</p>

<p>On the Honolulu City Council, Dela Cruz currently represents Mililani Mauka, Wahiawa, Whitmore Village, Mokuleia, Waialua, Haleiwa, Waimea, Pupukea, Sunset Beach, Kahuku, Laie, Hauula, Punaluu, Kahana, Kaaawa, Kualoa, Waiahole, Waikane, Kahaluu, Ahuimanu, and a portion of Heeia.</p>

<p>Senate District 22 consists of Mililani Mauka, Wahiawa, Haleiwa, Mokuleia, and North Shore.</p>

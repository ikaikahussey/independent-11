<p>MAKIKI &#8212; The Doris Duke Theater at the Honolulu Academy of Arts begins the Bookish! Novels on the Big Screen series with a screening of From Here to Eternity on Wednesday, December 7 in honor of Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and those who fought in World War II. Called “one of the landmarks of American film” by Kenneth Turan (Los Angeles Times), From Here to Eternity won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay—the most awarded to any film since Gone With The Wind in 1939.</p>

<p>Bookish! continues at the Doris Duke through December 24 with a wide variety of films adapted from literary works from the UK, Japan, France and Japan and authors such as Dostoyevsky and D.H. Lawrence. Each film will be introduced by a noted University of Hawaii professor specializing in the language and literature of each film’s origin.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; The Honolulu Academy of Arts Doris Duke Theatrer screens the acclaimed new documentary by German filmmaker Werner Herzog, <em><a href="http://honoluluacademy.org/events/friends_of_film_friday/11654-cave_forgotten_dreams" target="_blank">Cave of Forgotten Dreams</a></em>, for one night only as part of the Academy’s film program Friends of Film Friday on June 17.</p>

<p><em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams</em> explores Southern France’s infamous Chauvet caves, a treasure trove of the oldest Paleolithic art ever discovered. The caves are off-limits to visitors, but Herzog gained unprecedented permission to film them under strict parameters. He could film for only six four-hour days with a crew of three people using minimal equipment—including a special camera that had to be assembled inside the cave. The paintings Herzog filmed are 32,000 years old, and his narration moves from scientific to metaphysical.</p>

<p>“Herzog is one if the greatest filmmakers working today and to see his masterful treatment of what is arguably the foundation of our shared cultural heritage is an opportunity no one should pass up,” says Gina Caruso, Director of the Academy’s Doris Duke Theatre.</p>

<p>Friends of Film Friday screenings include a special guest speaker and a pre-film reception, where filmgoers can purchase Da Spot’s global cuisine and get a complimentary beverage—wine or a soft drink. This month, award-winning documentary filmmaker and University of Hawai‘i film lecturer Marlene Booth will introduce the documentary and lead a post-screening Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Food from Da Spot will be available for purchase, and a glass of wine or soft drink is included with ticket purchase.</p>

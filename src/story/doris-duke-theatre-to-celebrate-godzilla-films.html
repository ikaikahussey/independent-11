<p>MAKIKI&#8212;The Honolulu Academy of Arts&#8217; Doris Duke Theatre celebrates the indomitable legacy of “Godzilla” films in the horror movie genre with its Oh My Godzilla! series from December 27 to 30. The opening night will screen <em>Godzilla vs. Seamonster</em>, which also features fan favorite Mothra. The opening reception will include sushi and sake for purchase.</p>

<p>December 28 will feature <em>Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla II</em>, the first in a series to feature baby Godzilla. December 29 and 30 will screen the original 1954 <em>Godzilla</em> film, directed by acclaimed master Ishiro Honda.

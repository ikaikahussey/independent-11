<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;Down to Earth has been bringing Hawaii all organic and natural food for over 30 years. The popular natural food chain will be adding a sixth store when it opens shop in the Kapolei Commons Shopping Center next year.</p>

<p>The company signed a lease with the Kapolei Commons developers to break ground early in 2011. The Kapolei location will be Down to Earth&#8217;s largest store and bring about 50 jobs to Oahu&#8217;s west side&#8212;making it the company&#8217;s new flagship store.</p>

<p>Down to Earth is the only all-vegetarian natural foods store in Hawaii and one of only a few in the nation.</p>

<p>“Customers from Kapolei and Makakilo have been asking us to come to their neighborhood for years,&#8221; said the store&#8217;s Chief Vegetarian Officer Mark Fergusson. &#8220;We’re thrilled to be able to do that as our mission is to help improve the health of our island communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new location will be 10,000 square feet in the vicinity of big name retailers like Target, Petco, Sports Authority, and Price Busters.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are extremely pleased to welcome Down to Earth to Kapolei Commons and share their vision to promote better health for local residents and visitors alike,&#8221; said Duncan MacNaughton, founder of The MacNaugton Group (TMG), which developed Kapolei Common.</p>

<p>The new Kapolei store will carry a variety of natural and organic foods including groceries, dairy products, local organic produce, bulk foods, vitamins and natural supplements, body care products, and green household items similar to the other Oahu locations.</p>

<p>However, the new flagship location will include its own kitchen for the all-vegeterian deli, fresh juices and smoothies, salad bar, and made-to-order sandwich and desert menu according to Fergusson.</p>

<p>Down to Earth has come a long way from being a little shop in Moiliili.</p>

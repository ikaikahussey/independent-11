<p>Downbeat Diner, the much-welcomed food-bearing fixture on Chinatown&#8217;s Hotel Street, is celebrating their expansion tonight into an adjoining storefront, where they&#8217;ve built an acoustically-treated performance space and bar. Now redubbed Downbeat Diner and Lounge, the brainchild of rocker Joshua Hancock (&#8220;Josh86&#8221;) and producer Serena Hashimoto is officially open for business.</p>

<p>We can look forward to a great selection of independent music and libations. From their official announcement:</p>

<blockquote><p>We will be holding monthly and weekly events such as our singer/songwriter themed &#8216;True Tone Tuesdays&#8217; with James McCarthy, and  &#8216;The Clampdown&#8217; on the third fridays featuring rock, punk, ska and indie bands.</p>

<p>Our bar specializes in fine whiskeys and the cocktail menu includes hard to find mixed drinks such as an Oke Punch. Bar manager and mixologist Nicole Jones has already gained notoriety with her whiskey and western wendsdays and innovative cocktail menu on the Diner side. At the Lounge she expands her creativity to include house made infusions. The bar also has six beers on tap, including a $3.50 pint of Primo and a rotating craft beer. Now tapped, the popular Coronado Orange Avenue Wit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Join them tonight from 9-10 pm for a Grand Opening celebration, featuring music by Sweet Corn and Peanut and ANIMAL MOTHER, complementary pupus, and drinks.</p>

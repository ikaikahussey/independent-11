<p>Downtown Honolulu&#8217;s Irish pub community has galvanized in in support of the U.S.A. soccer team. The Irish are, almost categorically, rabid soccer fans. Anchored by Murphy&#8217;s Bar &amp; Grill, that tradition continues Saturday morning with O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s Irish Pub and J.J. Dolan&#8217;s also opening early at 8:00 a.m. to accommodate throngs of those infected with World Cup fever. Due to the likelihood that Murphy&#8217;s will reach capacity early, owner Don Murphy called Dolan&#8217;s Danny Dolan to suggest that he open early for the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;It just makes sense,&#8221; says Dolan. &#8220;People want to see the game in at atmosphere of comaraderie. And besides, we&#8217;re huge soccer fans.&#8221; Murphy&#8217;s and Dolan&#8217;s will have a breakfast buffet for attendees and O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s will also have snacks to go with what is likely to be copious amounts of beer. World Cup fever is alive in Downtown. <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> will be on hand to document the madness.</p>

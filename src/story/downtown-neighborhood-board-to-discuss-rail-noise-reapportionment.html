<p>DOWNTOWN&#8212;The Downtown Neighborhood Board is scheduled to meet Thursday, August 4 to hear and discuss a variety of issues that affect residents, businesses, and governments agencies now and for the future.</p>

<p>In addition to regular board business, including reports from the police and fire departments, City Transportation Director Wayne Yoshioka will give a presentation on non-construction street closure permits.

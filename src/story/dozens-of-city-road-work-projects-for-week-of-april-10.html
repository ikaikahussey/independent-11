<p>The week of April 10 will see the greater Honolulu area undergoing dozens of City road work projects that will force lane closures and traffic congestion in a variety of neighborhoods. Much of the work beginning or already underway involves sewer rehabilitation. Many of the projects have an estimated completion date of April of this year. Others, however, will be ongoing until as late as 2013.</p>

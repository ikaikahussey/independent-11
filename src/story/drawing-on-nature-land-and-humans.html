<p><strong class="question">How would you describe your art and yourself as an artist?</strong></p>

<p>My art is a combination of Hawaiian and asian themes. A lot of my subject matter is rooted in Hawaiian culture and my experiences of living in Hawaii. The graphic imagery of my art more clearly represents Asian influences. </p>

<p><strong class="question">How does the Hawaiian culture or Hawaii in general play a role in your artwork?</strong></p>

<p>I take a lot of the inspiration for my subjects and themes from Hawaiian culture. Most of the animals that I paint or draw live in Hawaii and have a significant relationship to the land. I am interested in the way that nature, land, and humans all have an interdependence on each other. </p>

<p><strong class="question">What do you strive to create through your art?</strong></p>

<p>Through my art I hope to create a greater awareness to the beauty and spirit of nature. I think that all living things have a power or spirit that can be seen by just taking the time to look and observe. Through my paintings and drawings I hope to give people the opportunity the time to look, observe, feel, and reflect in an environment that may not be able to provide it.</p>

<p><strong class="question">What are the main influences of your art?</strong></p>

<p>My art is influenced by my everyday life and experiences of living in Hawaii. I am also interested in the spirit and energy of living things. I&#8217;m getting my Masters, working three jobs, and do my art. I am very busy and I constantly reflect on how I am detached from nature and the simple things in life. By making art I reconnect myself with the simple joys of life and the human bond with nature. </p>

<p><strong class="question">How has your artwork evolved over time?</strong></p>

<p>My style and art has been pretty much self-taught. Therefore my artwork and style are constantly evolving. My artwork now is much more deeper in meaning and connections. I am also much more interested in the human relationship with nature. </p>

<p><strong class="question">What are your favorite things to draw and why?</strong></p>

<p>I like to draw animals, especially animals that are pertinent to Hawaii and Hawaiian culture.. I specifically enjoy to paint birds and fishes because they are the masters of worlds that are unknown to humans. I also draw human ladies. The ladies that I draw are to represent the paradox of innocence and intimacy. </p>

<p><strong class="question">What sets your artwork apart from others?</strong></p>

<p>I think that my artwork is a unique combination of stylists realism and graphic imagery. The realism draws people into to something familiar then the graphic and sometimes abstract imagery creates a reflection on deeper meanings and connections. </p>

<p><strong class="question">What is one thing that people wouldn?t know about your artwork just from looking at it?</strong></p>

<p>A lot of my artwork comes from my personal experiences. My jobs require that I communicate with people of all ages. These experiences in combination with my own social experiences and observations help spark the inspiration for my pieces. </p>

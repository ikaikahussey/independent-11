<p>WAIKIKI &#8212; The 13th annual <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/#!/emalamaikekai" target="_blank">E Malama I Ke Kai Ocean Awareness Festival</a></strong> comes to Kapiolani Park on Saturday, May 14, bringing, education, entertainment, keiki activities, Hawaiian food and a silent auction, all to raise awareness about the preservation of the natural and cultural resources provided by Hawaii’s ocean. The film <em>Papa Mau: The Wayfinder</em> will be screened for free at the Kapiolani Park Bandstand at 7:00 p.m. , presented by Pacific Islanders in Communication.</p>

<p>Na Kama Kai will provide a free surf clinic, and a canoe race beginning in Maunalua Bay in East Oahu will finish at the beach near the festival. </p>

<p><em>Papa Mau: The Wayfinder</em> is a film about “Papa” Mau Piailug, the master navigator and first captain of the Hokulea voyaging canoe. Local filmmaker Naalehu Anthony’s movie captures the spirit and impact of Papa Mau’s incomparable contribution to the perpetuation of ancient maritime navigation and its importance to Polynesian and Native Hawaiian identity.</p>

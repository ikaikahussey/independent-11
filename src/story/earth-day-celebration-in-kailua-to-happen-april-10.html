<p>KAILUA&#8212;Last year, 65 volunteers committed 120 hours of service to a native plant garden and 110 native plants were installed as part of the inaugural Earth Day in Kailua festivities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huihawaii.org/earthday2010.html" title="Hui o Koolaupoko">Hui o Koolaupoko</a> will host the second annual Earth Day in Kailua on Saturday April 10 at Kawainui Neighborhood Park from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The event will focus on raising community awareness about local environmental issues and give environmental agencies, organizations, and businesses a chance to showcase the work that they are doing throughout the state. The event&#8217;s location also highlights the ecological and cultural significance of Kawainui Marsh, the largest existing wetland in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Twenty agencies and organizations will host free educational exhibits with information about environmental issues in Hawaii. Exhibits will feature interactive activities for the entire family, such as a hands-on watershed model, a wetland bird guessing game, and the opportunity to plant a native tree species.</p>

<p>Two workshops are also being offered throughout the day. The Board of Water Supply will host a Rain Barrel Construction Workshop from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.&nbsp; The workshop will educate participants about water conservation practices and provide all of the material and instructions on how to construct their own barrel. The Rain Barrel Construction Workshop is open to 30 participants. The lecture is $5 and the barrel construction materials are $30.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hui Ku Maoli Ola will host a Native Hawaiian Plant Workshop from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. The workshop will introduce participants to native Hawaiian plants which are ideal for home landscaping and also provide ecological benefits such as erosion control and biofiltration. This workshop will also include a guided tour of Kaha Garden to see how the native species will look full grown and integrated into the landscape. Native plant species will also be available for purchase during the event. Call (808) 381-7202 to reserve your place for either workshop.</p>

<p>Attendees who choose to walk or ride their bike to the event will be entered to win prizes donated by local businesses.

<p>There are two free events being held at East Oahu libraries this weekend of interest to the public.</p>

<p>First is the Friends of the Aina Haina Library Annual Book Sale this coming Friday and Saturday (April 23 and 24) from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.&nbsp; All proceeds from the sale will benefit the Aina Haina Public Library to fund programs and library materials.&nbsp; </p>

<p>On Friday, hardcover books and CDs will be priced at $2.00, paperbacks and children&#8217;s books at $1.00. The following day, those prices will be slashed by half  (with the exception of paperbacks, which will remain at $1.00).&nbsp; The final hour of Saturday&#8217;s sale (3:00-4:00 p.m.) will feature a Fill-A-Bag-To-The-Top special, for only $3.00 a bag.&nbsp; A selection of individually-priced Hawaiiana, Specials, and DVDs will also be located in the exhibit area at the front entrance of the library.</p>

<p>The next event is a &#8220;Meet the Author&#8221; program scheduled for Sunday, April 25, 2:00 p.m, at the Kaimuki Public Library. </p>

<p><i>The following is a press release from the Hawaii State Public Library:</i></p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how it would be like to win a lottery? Patricia Wood, whose father won the Washington State Lottery, will be featured in a &#8220;Meet the Author&#8221; program and discuss her novel &#8220;Lottery&#8221; at Kaimuki Public Library on Sunday, April 25 at 2:00 p.m. The free program will be conducted in<br />
the Adult Reading Section.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lottery&#8221; is the story about the nature of luck and chance, and how winning a $12-million lottery can complicate the recipient&#8217;s life, in more ways than one. This intriguing and much-acclaimed novel has been translated into more than 20 languages.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  </p>

<p>The one-hour program is suitable for ages 12 and older. Contact the library as soon as possible if a sign language interpreter or other special accommodation is needed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   </p>

<p>Kaimuki Public Library is located at 1041 Koko Head Avenue, corner of Koko Head and Harding Avenues.&nbsp; </p>

<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Continuing the shopping Renaissance that Kaimuki has witnessed in the last couple of years is the new Eco-chic boutique Drift. Located on Waialae Avenue, almost directly across the street from Town restaurant, the store has enjoyed a steady flow of stylish customers since it opened its doors on August 7.</p>

<p>Drift offers unique apparel, jewelry, and accessories for the savvy shopper who doesn&#8217;t want to choose between sustainability and being fashion-foreword. </p>

<p>The smart selection of offerings showcase a host of local designers. As co-owner Alessandra Klein explained to me, a desire to carry up-and-coming designers who &#8220;need a chance&#8221; was the primary inspiration for the store. She and her best friend and co-owner Laura Ivy have designed a line of tastefully embellished bikinis together for 15 years, called Urgentina. This experience with running a small business showed them the importance of having good venues to showcase their goods; as an unknown designer, a lack of visibility is the primary obstacle to success.</p>

<p>Some of the local talent showcased in the boutique include hand-drawn and printed t-shirts by Vers and Sierra Dew, Leaf and Pearl jewelry (designed by Roxy of the Vers design duo), Stoney Seas jewelry made from locally-sourced shells, La&#8217;akea jewelry from the North Shore, and their own Urgentina swimwear and Drift apparel, sandals, accessories, and jewelry. Their rubber “slippahs” embellished with shells ($38) tend to disappear before they can replace them&#8212;the craftsmanship is laborious but the results are amazing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Large format totes screen-printed by hand with vintage fabric accents proclaim “I love Kaimuki” or “I love Town” and are another hot seller.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A small yet adorable collection of children&#8217;s wear includes tees, bikinis, and one-of-a-kind garments by Carlson G made from vintage aloha wear. There are also great gift items, such as hand-painted cards and delicious hyper-local Indigenous soaps, which are made right on 12th Avenue. </p>

<p>An assortment of multinational goods round out the offerings&#8212;elegant Khush tunics (locally-designed but produced in Bali) and Florencia Arias dresses (Argentine designer living and designing here in Hawaii). The merchandise tends towards an affordable price point (most of it is well under $100) but reads as more expensive than it is (always a good thing!).</p>

<p>Klein and Ivy both live in Kaimuki, one street apart, and practically around the corner from the store. In addition to designing swimwear together, they are walking partners and they discovered the empty store front when they were out walking in the neighborhood. They signed the lease that day and opened the shop just two weeks later. Klein takes the lead in the design department while Ivy heads up the business side, but there is a healthy collaboration in both areas, which makes it a true partnership.</p>

<p>The shop’s vibe reflects the owners’ personalities, simultaneously modern and earthy, which corresponds with the shop’s interior decoration, all of which is either upcycled found pieces or purchased from Reuse Hawaii. Since everything is reused, the entire start-up budget (apart from rent, utilities, etc.) was less than $2500&#8212;an impressive feat within itself.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The beautiful wood floors were salvaged from three different homes, thanks to Ivy’s contractor fiancee. The striking burl wood desk was discovered under someone’s house and fixed up to become a show piece.&nbsp;  An old sink is transformed into a high-end sculptural fixture, comprised of a rustic assemblage of shells and driftwood.</p>

<p>In fact, driftwood constitutes much of the esthetic accents, and was the source for the boutique&#8217;s name. Alessandra and Laura’s shared pastime of collecting driftwood at Black Point yielded an interesting collection and a distinctive look for the shop.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Whether indulging in a little retail therapy for yourself or buying a gift for a friend, Drift boutique promises to deliver. Its fresh picks offer a refreshing alternative to the mall and the abundant parking out front makes it a convenient one as well. Besides, any consumer guilt you might feel after being tempted by everything in the store will be quickly assuaged by the knowledge that you helped to promote local talent.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Last week, the U.S. Department of Education warned that Hawaii’s $75 million in <A HREF="http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html" TARGET="_blank">Race to the Top educational funding was in jeopardy</a>.</p>

<p>In a letter addressed to Gov. Neil Abercrombie, U.S. Department of Education Policy Director Ann Whalen said Hawaii has been placed on “high-risk” status following the State’s request for drastic amendments to their Race to the Top plans earlier this year.</p>

<p>Hawaii’s change of plans follows a trend set by other states that were not able to follow through on education promises in the midst of balancing budgets in a hurting economy.</p>

<p><a >The Wall Street Journal</a></i> reported that  all 12 winning states in the Race to The Top competition either scaled down plans or pushed back timelines to overhaul their public-education systems.</p>

<p>Hawaii Department of Education Superintendent Kathryn Matayoshi said, that despite the warning, the State intends on delivering the promised initiatives laid out in their Race to the Top plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;The U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s placement of Hawaii&#8217;s Race to the Top grant on high-risk status is a very serious matter,” Matayoshi said in a statement. “This status change puts everyone on notice.”</p>

<p>Amendments to Hawaii’s plan that were approved by the U.S. Department of Education include:</p>

<p>* A shift in the timeline by one year for the Alternative Certification of Teachers project from <br />
June 2011 to June 2012. By State law, the <a >Hawaii Teacher Standards Board</a> (HTSB) is responsible for the approval of teacher education programs. The HTSB recently changed the definition of “alternative routes,” which the State said impacted its ability to implement their plan.</p>

<p>* A shift in timeline for the Alternative Certification of Principals project. The State has committed to preparing 24 candidates through this program, rather than 36 candidates as originally proposed. The State has reduced the budget in half, to a total of $720,000, due to updated cost estimates and fewer candidates. </p>

<p>* A shift in end dates for or the Knowledge Transfer System/Professional Development Framework project.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Education did not approve other changes requested by the State relating to plans for induction and mentoring, new pre-kindergarten initiatives, the Turnaround Leadership Program, and the removal of Project Management Oversight Committees at the Complex Area and school-level. Federal officials said the unapproved amendments too drastically altered the original strategy, timelines, and budgets to the State’s approved plans.</p>

<p>“The State has not demonstrated adequate progress implementing its approved plans in the first year of the grant as evidenced by the Department’s on-site program review in June 2011, monthly reports, and the proposed revised Scope of Work the State submitted in conjunction with their proposed amendments,” Whalen wrote. “The Department is concerned about the State’s ability to fulfill its commitments within the grant period.”</p>

<p>As a condition of being designated a high-risk grantee, Hawaii has been placed on a cost reimbursement payment basis, where the State iis required to submit receipts for expenditures to the U.S. Department of Education for approval prior to drawing down any grant funds. The State must also notify the U.S. Department of Education prior to obligating funds and must provide documentation to ensure alignment with its approved plan, as requested.</p>

<p>Hawaii’s Race to the Top funds are part of a competitive $4.35 billion nation-wide effort organized by the U.S. administration to dramatically re-shape America’s educational system. Race to the Top is designed to provide incentives to states to find ways to begin making the changes that business, political, community, and education leaders feel are needed to boost student achievement.</p>

<p>Hawaii failed to qualify as a finalist in the competition 2009&#8212;State furloughs that year created the  shortest school year in the nation.</p>

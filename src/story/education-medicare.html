<p>Lawmakers flew in for special session in order to vote on the bill, which is intended to help states avoid teacher and staff layoffs in the coming school year and provide a $16 billion increase in funding for Medicaid reimbursements.</p>

<p>“This bill means more than $100 million to Hawaii to help keep teachers on the job and to help the state pay for Medicaid,” said Hawaii Congresswoman Mazie Hirono, who voted in favor of the bill. “The bill is paid for, and the bill’s opponents know this. One of the ways we pay for the bill is by closing a tax loophole that is used by corporations shipping jobs overseas. In fact, some are voting against this bill because of this tax provision. I’m voting to support working families in America and to end incentives to move jobs out of America.”</p>

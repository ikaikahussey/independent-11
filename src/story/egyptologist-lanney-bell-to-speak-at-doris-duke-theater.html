<p>On Thursday, January 13, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, University of Hawaii-Manoa, Archaeological Institute of America, and LLEA are sponsoring a free lecture on Egypt’s King Tutankhamun by Dr. Lanney Bell, a distinguished Egyptologist from Brown University.</p>

<p>The illustrated lecture will provide insights into what the hundreds of treasures and artifacts found in Tut’s burial chamber actually tell us about his life and death. Among other aspects of the boy king&#8217;s life, Dr. Bell will discuss Tut’s parents, his rule, his widow, and his successor.</p>

<p>This free lecture should be a treat for Egyptian scholars and hobbyists of all ages.</p>

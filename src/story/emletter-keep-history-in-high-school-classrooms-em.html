<p><strong>United States History Not Required!</strong></p>

<p>The Hawaii Department of Education needs to clarify and amend Policy 4540 to make certain United States and World History are high school graduation requirements.&nbsp; We need to assure our keiki have rigorous academic coursework and a deep sense of citizenship.&nbsp; Imagine, our children not learning about the bombing of Pearl Harbor or about all the brave men and women who fought for our country.&nbsp; Not requiring these courses is an embarrassment and disservice to the students of Hawaii.&nbsp; I can see the national headlines now – “Hawaii to Become the Only State Not to Require U.S. History.”&nbsp; Superintendent Matayoshi needs to take the leadership steps and amend this policy before the September 20th Board of Education meeting or be prepared to become the laughing stock of the whole nation!&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;It was a sad day yesterday at the Council. It looked and sounded like a party, what with all the lei and dignitaries&#8212;or elected officials, anyway&#8212;and gifts and laughter and applause.</p>

<p>But there was an underlying tension, and Chairman Kaipo Asing, even as the subject of so many earnest accolades, was obviously dejected and glum. What should have been a landmark day for him as many paid tribute to his 28 years of service to the people of Kauai and Niihau was marred by the hulking presence of the elephant in the room.&#8221;</p>

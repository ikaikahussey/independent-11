<p><i>In an effort to identify the problems and propose solutions to Hawaii&#8217;s energy future, </i>The Hawaii Independent<i> <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/energy-what-will-you-do-to-conserve" target="_blank">proposed questions</a> to individuals who could contribute their unique insight in the energy dialogue.</p>

<p>Kelly King is vice president of Pacific Biodiesel Inc.</p>

<p>Here are her responses:</i></p>

<p><br />
<b>1. What do you do to conserve energy?</b></p>

<p>Everything we can. We recycle whatever we can, use florescent lighting in our offices, run our Maui plant on waste vegetable oil, and I personally have not used petroleum in any of my cars on Maui since the year 2000.</p>

<p><br />
<b>2. What do you think are Hawaii’s most pressing energy obstacles?</b></p>

<p>Our leaders and officials need help figuring out which technologies are real, what the potential is, and how to support them. There is a lot of distraction from newly proposed businesses who make claims that they cannot substantiate. We need an objective, research-based consulting organization that can give non-biased, non-political input to the Legislature and administration.</p>

<p><br />
<b>3. Are Hawaii businesses, organizations, and individuals on the right path in terms of reducing our energy consumption?</b></p>

<p>Some are, but too many are influenced by factors other than our state&#8217;s best interests.</p>

<div class="pull-gold">We need to stop looking for a silver bullet.</div>

<p><br />
<b>4. What do you see as Hawaii’s best source of alternative energy?</b></p>

<p>That depends on the application. I believe biodiesel is the best solution for transportation, but more solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro need to be utilized for the grid. We need to stop looking for a silver bullet and develop a portfolio of different options that will sustain our energy needs and environmental responsibilities.</p>

<p><br />
<b>5. Will the State of Hawaii reach its 2030 goal of 70 percent clean energy? Why or why not? And more importantly, at what cost?</b></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think so, and certainly not unless we get more focused on what is real and how we can help the current proven local renewable energy companies grow sustainably. Energy efficiency should be priority number one, but it also requires a huge investment that the State may not be able to afford up front.</p>

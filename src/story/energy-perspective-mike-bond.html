<p><i>In an effort to identify the problems and propose solutions to Hawaii&#8217;s energy future, </i>The Hawaii Independent<i> <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/energy-what-will-you-do-to-conserve" target="_blank">proposed questions</a> to individuals who could contribute their unique insight in the energy dialogue.</p>

<p>Mike Bond is a Molokai resident and energy industry veteran, with a background in environmental planning.</p>

<p>Here are his responses:</i></p>

<p><br />
<b>1. What do you do to conserve energy?</b> </p>

<p>We&#8217;ve added full solar PV and hot water to our new home so that we will be electricity neutral. </p>

<p>We&#8217;re using LED lightbulbs, efficient appliances, and insulating the roof. No Air Conditioning&#8212;there never used to be AC in Hawaii, but people are now building windows that don&#8217;t open so it gets designed into the structure when alternatives would be far better. </p>

<p>We&#8217;re also driving a pickup truck that gets 29 mpg, and using it only when necessary.</p>

<p><br />
<b>2. What do you think are Hawaii’s most pressing energy obstacles?</b></p>

<p>(1) 70 percent of our fossil fuel use is for vehicles. We should cut that in half. The Governor, rather than pursuing financial boondoggles such as wind farms and ocean pump storage that will raise our rates and enrich his friends, should work toward requirements for greater fuel efficiency in all vehicles sold in Hawaii.</p>

<div class="pull-gold">70 percent of our fossil fuel use is for vehicles. We should cut that in half.</div>

<p><br />
(2) Converting to rooftop PV and solar water heat on Hawaiian homes, offices, schools, and commercial centers can substantially reduce electricity demand. This can be supplemented by highly efficient coal-fired turbines using U.S. or Australian coal (not Middle East oil). This would substantially reduce our CO2 emissions compared to present generation and/or some of Hawaiian Electric Company&#8217;s (HECO) proposed mega-projects. </p>

<p>In order to expand rooftop solar, HECO must give up the 15 percent ceiling it imposes on it per network area. Although HECO argues that over 15 percent affects the grid, the effect is far less than that of constantly changing or nonexistent wind power.</p>

<p><br />
<b>3. Are Hawaii businesses, organizations, and individuals on the right path in terms of reducing our energy consumption?</b> </p>

<p>Other than a laudable 8.6 percent reduction in energy use in State buildings over the last three years, there has been little evidence of conservation in Hawaii. New development projects continue to get approved with insufficient conservation requirements. Substantial reductions could be made in air conditioning, lighting, and many other electricity end uses. Rooftop solar could be widely implemented, which is the single greatest option we have to reduce our energy consumption in terms of fossil fuels. It is also the cheapest.</p>

<p><br />
<b>4. What do you see as Hawaii’s best source of alternative energy?</b></p>

<p>As stated above, rooftop solar is by far the best source. New programs are being developed now in Hawaii to use pay-as-you-go for the financing of residential solar. HECO is even offering a bit, but we need a statewide program. </p>

<p>In many homes, hot water is 30 percent of electricity bills, and rooftop hot water heaters are a fantastic alternative. Because solar doesn&#8217;t work at night, highly efficient and inexpensive coal-fired generation can pick up that load, and serve as load-balancing in the daytime. Wind power, with its huge turbines, miles of expensive undersea cables and its disastrous impacts on cultural, wildlife, social, marine, soils, vegetation, property, and other resources, is a mega-scam that enriches its backers through tax writeoffs that further impoverish our national and state budgets and raises our electricity rates. </p>

<p><br />
<b>5. Will the State of Hawaii reach its 2030 goal of 70 percent clean energy? Why or why not? And more importantly, at what cost?</b> </p>

<p>It would be easy by 2030, but not without changing the existing mindset at HECO and the Governor&#8217;s office. HECO fears rooftop solar because it will cut its income substantially. The company is already on the brink of junk bond status, and is an industrial dinosaur. Its fixation on centralized generation is denying Hawaii the chance to become the most energy independent state in the Union and reduce everyone&#8217;s electricity rates in the long term. </p>

<p>If the Governor will give up his mega-projects and concentrate on what is feasible and cost-effective, we could well reach that goal by 2030.</p>

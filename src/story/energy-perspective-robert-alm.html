<p><i>In an effort to identify the problems and propose solutions to Hawaii&#8217;s energy future, </i>The Hawaii Independent<i> <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/energy-what-will-you-do-to-conserve" target="_blank">proposed questions</a> to individuals who could contribute their unique insight in the energy dialogue.</p>

<p>Robert Alm is Hawaiian Electric Company&#8217;s (HECO) Senior Vice President of Public Affairs. Alm oversees the overall operation of the HECO&#8217;s regulatory and government affairs, corporate communications, consumer education, and community relations. </p>

<p>Here are his responses:</i></p>

<p><br />
<b>1. What do you do to conserve energy?</b></p>

<p>On a personal level, we have solar water heating, no a/c, ambient lighting whenever possible, and nothing but <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&amp;pgw_code=LB" target="_blank">CFL bulbs</a>. We turn off lights and equipment when not in use and unplug plugs (phantom electricity) as much as possible.</p>

<p>On a company level the biggest pushes have been in the areas of lighting and the use of cold water whenever possible.</p>

<p><br />
<b>2. What do you think are Hawaii’s most pressing energy obstacles?</b></p>

<p>The mismatch of load (on Oahu) with the abundance of renewable resources (on the neighbor islands).</p>

<p>The lack of inter-island interconnection (<a href="http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/energy/publications/Navigant-2011.pdf" target="_blank">i.e. the undersea cable</a>).</p>

<p>NIMBYISM. </p>

<p>The length of time it takes to develop a project.</p>

<p>Any intramurals between renewable resources, there is plenty of room for all.</p>

<p><br />
<b>3. Are Hawaii businesses, organizations, and individuals on the right path in terms of reducing our energy consumption?</b></p>

<p>Use is down statewide (See the following chart). Much more needs to be done.</p>

<p><br />
<b>4. What do you see as Hawaii’s best source of alternative energy?</b></p>

<p>There is no silver bullet, no single resource that we should focus on. We should develop them all: Wind, solar, biomass, biofuels, geothermal, <a href="http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/energy/renewable/otec" target="_blank"> Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion</a> (OTEC), and Ocean Energy.</p>

<p>Geothermal and OTEC would be game changers if fully developed and could provide much of our energy.</p>

<p><br />
<b>5. Will the State of Hawaii reach its 2030 goal of 70 percent clean energy? Why or why not? And more importantly, at what cost?</b></p>

<p>Hawaii can reach these goals because the resources are there.</p>

<p>We will however need to pull together and get the projects done. There will be lots of opposition (NIMBY, resource fighting resource, etc.)</p>

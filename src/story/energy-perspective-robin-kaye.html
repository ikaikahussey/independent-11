<p><i>In an effort to identify the problems and propose solutions to Hawaii&#8217;s energy future, </i>The Hawaii Independent<i> <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/energy-what-will-you-do-to-conserve" target="_blank">proposed questions</a> to individuals who could contribute their unique insight in the energy dialogue.</p>

<p>Robin Kaye lives on the island of Lanai and is a spokesperson for Friends of Lanai, a community group formed to give voice to the the island&#8217;s residents who strongly oppose the Oahu industrial wind power plant on Lanai. Here are Kaye&#8217;s responses:</i></p>

<p><br />
<b>1. What do you do to conserve energy?</b></p>

<p>We have had solar hot water for two years, and just last week installed a photo-voltaic system on our roof. We hang clothes to dry almost daily and have switched to CFL bulbs. </p>

<p><br />
<b>2. What do you think are Hawaii’s most pressing energy obstacles?</b></p>

<p>There are several. </p>

<p>(1) The absence of a community discussion on how to achieve energy independence and self-sufficiency on each island.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(2) The State&#8217;s insistence on pushing wind as &#8220;the&#8221; answer. As Rep. Denny Coffman (D) said recently, our energy policy is being pushed by a project (<a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/the-damage-is-in-the-details-big-wind-blowing-past-lanai-voices" target="_blank">Big Wind</a>) rather than a plan.&nbsp; </p>

<p>(3) A clear, open conversation about how much more renewable energy will cost the ratepayers and taxpayers, in the form of grants and subsidies.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>(4) The necessary but challenging policy discussion of centralized power (e.g., an undersea energy cable that interconnects the islands) vs. decentralized power.</p>

<p><br />
<b>3. Are Hawaii businesses, organizations, and individuals on the right path in terms of reducing our energy consumption?</b></p>

<p>Some are. For instance, those who are working toward explorations of all the potential sources.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we are not hearing enough about conservation of energy, especially on those island that use the most. </p>

<p><br />
<b>4. What do you see as Hawaii’s best source of alternative energy?</b></p>

<p>I see a variety of sources. Geothermal, OTEC, solar, concentrated solar, and hopefully in the near future, wave power.</p>

<p><br />
<b>5. Will the State of Hawaii reach its 2030 goal of 70 percent clean energy? Why or why not? And more importantly, at what cost?</b></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s remember first that this is a goal. Should HECO not reach it, the penalties must come from their shareholders, not their ratepayers&#8212;and they might not be imposed by the <a href="http://puc.hawaii.gov/" target="_blank">Public Utilities Commission</a> at all. Several states have already begun to roll back their <a href="http://www.pewclimate.org/what_s_being_done/in_the_states/rps.cfm" target="_blank">Renewable Portfolio Standard</a> (RPS), acknowledging that achieving them is simply too costly to do in a very short time frame. What the Legislature giveth, the Legislature can amend.</p>

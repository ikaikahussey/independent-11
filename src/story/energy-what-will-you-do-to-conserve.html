<p>Last month, <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> turned its focus on <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/focus/food" target="_blank">Hawaii&#8217;s food future</a>. We looked at the numbers, spoke with farmers and restaurant owners, and heard from our readers. And what the dialogue pointed to was a very bad situation for Hawaii&#8217;s agricultural lands and many obstacles for our small farmers and business owners who want to ensure that we can feed our future residents. But what our &#8220;<a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/gallery/feeding-the-future" target="_blank">Feeding the Future</a>&#8221; forum at Fresh Cafe helped bring to light was that it&#8217;s not an entirely hopeless situation. There are still a lot of people in Hawaii who are willing to create a dialogue for change and, more importantly, take action.</p>

<p>While our attention for food and agriculture isn&#8217;t over, <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> would like to turn its spotlight toward energy for the month of July and create that same kind of inspired dialogue. And we need your help to guide the conversation.</p>

<p>What do you do to conserve energy?</p>

<p>What do you think are Hawaii&#8217;s most pressing energy issues?</p>

<p>Are Hawaii businesses, organizations, and individuals on the right path in terms of reducing our energy consumption?</p>

<p>What do you see as Hawaii&#8217;s best source of alternative energy?</p>

<p>Will Hawaii reach its 2030 goal of 70 percent clean energy? Why or why not? And more importantly, at what cost?</p>

<div class="pull-black">Please let us know in the comments below or email news@thehawaiiindependent.com</div>

<p><br />
Our goal for the next month will be to describe the obstacles, propose solutions, and get Hawaii&#8217;s people to participate in the energy dialogue.</p>

<p>Later this month, a four-evening event organized by the <a href="http://environmentalcaucusofthedemocraticpartyofhawaii.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Environmental Caucus of the Democratic Party of Hawaii</a> will bring together experts and concerned citizens alike in a roundtable conversation on Hawaii’s energy future on July 11, July 18, July 25, and August 1 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the Democratic State Headquarters in Ward Warehouse.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here are some energy saving tips from the Hawaiian Electric Company to keep cool during these hot summer months.</p>

<p>1. When air conditioning is necessary, set the thermostat at the warmest comfortable setting. Each degree above 75 degrees saves you approximately 3 percent of the energy used to cool your home.</p>

<p>2. Run ceiling fans to help circulate cool air rather than lowering the thermostat temperature.</p>

<p>3. Keep cool air in by closing doors and windows when the a/c is on.</p>

<p>4. Shade a/c units with trees to increase their efficiency, but avoid blocking air flow around the condenser.</p>

<p>5. To block the afternoon sun, plant medium-sized trees on the west side of your home. Hang awnings or blinds or install tinting film on south and west facing windows.</p>

<p>6. Grow shrubs and groundcover plants near driveways, sidewalks, and lanais to reduce heat radiation.</p>

<p>7. Install Energy Star qualified lighting, computers, printers, copiers, electronics, and appliances, which use less energy and produce less heat so you can reduce your air conditioning load.</p>

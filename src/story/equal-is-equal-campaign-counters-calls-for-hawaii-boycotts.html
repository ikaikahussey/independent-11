<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Pride Alliance Hawaii (PAH) launched the <a href="http://www.equalisequalhawaii.com/" title="Equal Is Equal campaign">Equal Is Equal campaign</a> last week. The campaign is being coordinated in partnership with the <a href="http://glc4me.com" title="Gay and Lesbian Connection for Me">Gay and Lesbian Connection for Me</a> and the <a href="http://lgbhawaii.com" title="Lesbian and Gay Businesses of Hawaii">Lesbian and Gay Businesses of Hawaii</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of the Equal Is Equal campaign is to counter calls for boycotts of Hawaii after Gov. Linda Lingle vetoed Hawaii&#8217;s civil union bill, House Bill 444.</p>

<p>“Even though Lingle vetoed the Civil Union bill, we do not want the homophobic actions of one person to financially harm the 81 percent of people in Hawaii that support LGBT equality,&#8221; said Michael Golojuch, Jr., Campaign Coordinator, Pride Alliance Hawaii. &#8220;Instead of a boycott, we are launching a &#8216;BUYcott&#8217; to support those businesses that support equality.” </p>

<p>The Equal Is Equal campaign is starting with LGBT owned and/or supportive businesses in Hawaii and will expand to include local businesses that also support economic justice. Equality at every level is the ultimate goal of the Equal Is Equal campaign.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“Pride Alliance Hawaii encourages members of the LGBT community and our allies to travel to Hawaii and spend their money with businesses that support equal and just treatment of their customers and employees,” said Tara O’Neill, president of Pride Alliance Hawaii.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
My old church members have made the largest donations and devoted the most help. </p>

<p><b>Do you think that the debate over gay marriage contributes to gay bashing in our schools?</b><br />
No, gay bashing was way more prevalent when I was in school. It is such a politically correct taboo now they will try to convict you on hate speech. Gay bashing is a fact of life. Until the gay activists can steal the people’s First Amendment rights it will remain. The real question to ask is if the gay marriage debate contributes to Christian bashing in our society?</p>

<p><b>How, as an elected official, will you support and enforce the existing State laws that protect and nurture the rights of Native Hawaiians?</b><br />
Yes, our existing laws for all people needs to be enforced and protected for all people not just Native Hawaiians. The current rights to Hawaiian Home Lands need to be expedited. [The Office of Hawaiian Affairs] needs to be managed for the benefits of not just a select group of Hawaiians but all Native Hawaiians.</p>

<p><b>What kind of tax relief do you support and how else do we lower the cost of living for full time residents?</b><br />
I would write legislation to simplify the tax codes and structure in Hawaii and lower the tax burden on all Hawaii citizens in any way possible.&nbsp; Cut back on Public Sector waste and giving more tax incentives to businesesses in order to stimulate the economy.</p>

<p><b>How do you limit bureaucracy in government and manage civil work for efficiency?</b><br />
Evaluate the consolidation of government services and agencies in order to evaluate how to save money and serve Hawaii’s people first.</p>

<p><b>What ideas do you have for improving our education system?</b><br />
Conduct an independent audit of [The Department of Education] and create teachers incentives to earn more pay with better results. Also we should have a school board that is accountable and is not self-serving </p>

<p><b>What’s going to be your input in addressing Hawaii’s homeless crisis?</b><br />
If elected, I would propose to create cultural-based community ohana groups by connecting people in need and strengthening the values of Polynesian cultures through various activities such as farming native food crops and the production of locally made products on unused State and government lands. Living standards would at first be limited to the standards of old Hawaii, but is better than not having a roof over their heads as most do now. Also, I would create places where the needy would like to go to be a part of something they can feel proud of and have their basic needs provided in one place.</p>

<p><b>How would you improve accountability in government?</b><br />
Reform government by introducing term limits. Cut back the size of government and the number of politicians needed to run it. Eliminate back door and &#8220;sweet heart&#8221; deals by expanding the Sunshine Law to the legislative branch.</p>

<p><b>What is your opinion on Hawaii’s current approach to renewable energy?</b><br />
We should proceed forward in freeing ourselves from Middle East’s control of our energy costs and be careful to implement renewable energy in an economical and efficient manner. </p>

<p><b>Do you support legislation that would establish clear definitions and penalties for human trafficking in Hawaii?</b><br />
Sure, I would support legislation. How does this happen in our times? Immigration needs to be enforced to prevent these situations.</p>

<p><b>Are you aware of concerns Hawaii residents have with the lack of enforcement of child support laws, and do you see a way you could address it if elected?</b><br />
As a credit union employee, I see firsthand how &#8220;deadbeat dads&#8221; can be found. If they bank through a federally insured institution, they can’t escape. The current system should be enforced with help of the community to help find and collect from delinquents.</p>

<p><b>In balancing the State budget, what specific government programs or services would you cut?</b><br />
Department of Education administrative costs, legislators&#8217; pay and session costs, some arts, and some government programs already covered by the City and federal governments and overall cuts to pork barrell spending. </p>

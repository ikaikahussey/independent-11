HONOLULU&#8212;If it is possible for a musician to beam over the phone, Erica Sunshine Lee does it from her home in the Bay Area, where she performs regularly when not on the road. The Elberton, Georgia native is gleefully anticipating her upcoming Oahu shows. With country roots, a folk sensibility, and a rock-and-roll heart, Lee is forging a career destined for only those true to their art and committed to the work that success as a performer demands. Also, she surfs.</p>

<p>?Yeah, I?ve got some boards here at home and some in Hawaii,? she says. ?I?ll be out there for sure.?</p>

<p>Lee relocated to the Bay Area after visiting her sister there a couple of years ago. She made a fine living selling cars and landed a scholarship playing softball at an area college. She?s come a very long way.</p>

<p>Lee began singing at the young age of ?about six,? as many country singers do, in a church choir. Her parents were supportive from the beginning, purchasing for her a karaoke machine to encourage and nurture a natural musical talent. She has been performing professionally for six years, and writing her own original material as well.</p>

<p>?I can play covers until I?m blue in the face,? she laughs in a lilting Southern drawl. But it is her songwriting that has brought her the most fulfillment as a performing artist. ?It?s incredible when someone comes up to me and says ?I feel like you wrote that song for me.??</p>

<p>Lee has recently released the album Road to Recovery and is already hard at work on her next album, recording in storied Nashville, Tennessee. She will be performing two shows in Honolulu: Tuesday night at Kelley O?Neil?s in Waikiki and on Thursday at O?Toole?s Irish Pub in Chinatown. </p>

<p>?I?m actually supposed to be taking a vocal rest,? Lee says sheepishly. ?But I?m really looking forward to the shows.?</p>

<p>Erica Sunshine Lee has performed in Hawaii before, most notably alongside Henry Kapono at his gig at Duke?s Canoe Club and Barefoot Bar. She?s also graced the stage with ZZ Top, a band with possibly the most down-home street cred in the American music industry. Lee confesses a weakness for Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, and admits that at least a portion of her time in Hawaii will be spent seeking to fulfill that craving.</p>

<p>True to the tradition of the hard-working American music professional, Lee?s Honolulu sojourn will be a working vacation, a time to recharge while charging the waves by day and playing her music at night. With an angelic beauty, flowing blond curls and a voice that breaks hearts, Lee?s will be a welcome sight in the water and on the stage.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Commission wishes to congratulate all Representatives and all Senators for having completed their 2017 Disclosures of Financial Interests by the January 31 filing deadline, and has therefore issued Ethics Awards to both houses of the Legislature in recognition of their 100 percent success rate in completing the filing requirement on time. Speaker Joseph Souki and President Ronald Kouchi were presented with certificates signed by all five Ethics Commissioners.</p>

<p>EWA&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu is set to build the the new Ocean Pointe Fire Station, which will replace the old Ewa Beach fire house. The new station will meet environmental and energy saving standards and improve response times in Ewa.</p>

<p>Last week, the City awarded a contract to 57 Builders Ltd.</p>

<p>The new 12,000-square-foot Ocean Pointe station will include two fire equipment bays, an office, living quarters, a kitchen, dining room, exercise room, and support facilities for a five-firefighter engine company. The design has also allowed for a second fire company in the future if called for.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A  multi-level training tower has also been integrated into the plan to replace the iconic, but obsolete, hose towers of fire stations of the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no greater City priority than public safety, and this new fire station will ensure our first-responders have the facilities they need,&#8221; said acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell. &#8220;Projects like these also create construction jobs at a time when we need to put people back to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>At an estimated $4.6 million, the fire station will be built on over an acre of land donated by development company Haseko. The station will be neighbors with Seagull School across of Keoneula Elementary. </p>

<p>The overall <a href="http://www.ocean-pointe.com/proposedmasterplan.html" title="Ocean Pointe development plan">Ocean Pointe development plan</a> includes residential neighborhoods, parks, a commercial district, a golf course, and a marina.</p>

<p>&#8220;This location will help us maintain our response time standards in the Ewa community and provide a 21st century, modern fire station,&#8221; said Fire Chief Ken Silva in a statement.</p>

<p>The construction of the station will also be the first City project to achieve the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.</p>

<p>Construction on the fire station is scheduled to begin later this year and is expected to take a year to complete. Once the existing Ewa Fire Station, located across of Ewa Beach Community Park, is vacated, the building may be used for other projected fire department operational needs. If HFD determines the site is longer needed for its operations, it will be returned to the City property inventory.</p>

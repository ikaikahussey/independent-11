<p>EWA&#8212;The Ewa Villages and West Loch golf courses are closed today due to heavy rains and the grounds already saturated from last weekâ€™s rainy conditions.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for Oahu until Tuesday. </p>

<p>Forecasters predict widespread rain, heavy showers, and the risk of flash flooding. Residents should avoid non-essential travel, be aware of road closures and monitor TV and radio broadcasts during this period. </p>

<p>Flash flooding can cause a wall of water to rush down drainage canals and streams. Avoid these areas during heavy rainfall and do not attempt to cross flooded roads.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; Former Hawaii Republican Party Chair John Carroll announced today that he will run for the U.S. Senate, for the seat to be vacated by Senator Daniel Akaka. </p>

<p>His platform includes a proposal to allow qualified Hawaiian Home Lands lessees to obtain the fees for their properties. In today’s announcement, he also cited concerns over the state’s high cost of living, unfair treatment of native Hawaiians, lack of affordable housing, and a lack of “good jobs.”</p>

<p>“Our Country faces very similar problems and the only leaders I observe making anything like common sense, fiscally responsible comments are the US House Republicans,” said Carroll in today’s announcement. “We need the US Senate to be doing what the House is doing. I will gladly join that fight.”</p>

<p>Carroll is a decorated former military officer and former legislator in both the Hawaii House and Senate. He ran for and lost the 2010 Republican nomination for Hawaii Governor. Carroll also played football for the University of Hawaii.</p>

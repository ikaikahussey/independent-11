<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Kurt Kawafuchi resigned from his position as the director of the Department of Taxation (<a href="http://hawaii.gov/tax/" title="DOTAX">DOTAX</a>) on Thursday, May 20.</p>

<p>As the DOTAX head, Kawafuchi was responsible for all aspects of tax administration for the State, including audits, collections, criminal tax investigations, legislation, administrative guidance, operations, taxpayer services, and research and planning. He was first appointed to the governor&#8217;s cabinet as deputy tax director in 2003.</p>

<p>Kawafuchi told <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> that the decision &#8220;was a mutual thing&#8221; between himself and Gov. Linda Lingle. While State spokespeople told the press that Kawafuchi&#8217;s last official day will be June 15, <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> has learned that the former director cleared out his office within 24 hours of resigning. Kawafuchi&#8217;s meeting with Gov. Linda Lingle prior to resigning on Thursday came two days after Kawafuchi had met with the State Auditor&#8217;s office.</p>

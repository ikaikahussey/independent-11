<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Sewer rehabilitation work along Kalanianaole Highway in the Aina Haina area will take place on weekends, beginning on January 8 until February 13.</p>

<p>The construction is a continuation of the Kalanianaole Highway Sewer Rehabilitation Project, which began in August 2010.</p>

<p>The rehabilitation work requires 19 continuous hours to set-up, install liner, cure the resins, cool down, and demobilize in order to complete the cured-in-place-pipe lining process.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The work will be conducted from Saturdays at 7:00 p.m. to Sundays at 2:00 p.m. (19 hours). Work will begin on January 8 and continue each weekend for approximately six weekends.</p>

<p>For Week no. 1 to Week no. 3, the right lane in the east-bound direction of Kalanianaole Highway, between Wailupe Beach Park and West Hind Drive, will be closed.</p>

<p>For Week no. 4 to Week no. 6, the right lane in the east-bound direction of Kalanianaole Highway, between West Hind Drive and East Hind Drive, will be closed.</p>

<p>Depending on traffic volume and conditions, the center lane may also be closed between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. for the safety of the work crew.&nbsp; Work will also continue during the normal working hours, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., with lane closures along the highway.</p>

<p>The Aina Haina Neighborhood Board and Hawaii Kai Neighborhood Board have been notified of the pending work. In addition, an electronic message board was installed near Wailupe Beach Park to inform the traveling public.</p>

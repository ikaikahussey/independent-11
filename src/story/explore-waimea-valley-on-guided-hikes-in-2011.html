<p>NORTH SHORE&#8212;In 2011, put on your boots and check out Waimea Valley&#8217;s hiking series, which will offer easy to moderate family hikes as well as strenuous five-hour hikes for the serious trail master around the 1,800 acre valley.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Starting in January 2011, valley hikes will take place every Saturday with the five-hour strenuous hike being offered only once a month on the last Saturday. Guides will accompany all hikes and will help hikers identify native plants, fish, insects, and indigenous birds. </p>

<p>All children 15 years of age or younger must be accompanied by an adult and children must be at least seven-years-old to participate. Family hikes cost $10 per person plus the cost of admission to the valley. Space is limited to 20 participants and reservations are required. </p>

<p>For the strenuous hikes, participants must be at least 12-years-old. The price is $15 in addition to the cost of valley admission. At least five participants are required for the hike to take place. Valley representatives ask that participants make their reservations no later than the Friday before the Saturday hike. </p>

<p>The hikes will begin at 9:00 a.m., ending at 12:30 p.m. Participants are advised to bring a snack, insect repellent, sunscreen, and water. Closed-toe, non-slip hiking shoes are required without exception.</p>

<p>Over 100 student performers in collaboration with FHS alumni, faculty, and community groups will be putting on a spectacular show filled with music, dance and theatrics for the public in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the school.</p>

<p>Founded in 1936, Farrington High School has a long and proud history that will be shared with the Kapalama community. The public will be treated to a special video tribute in honor of the school’s namesake, Wallace Rider Farrington, who served as the sixth governor of the Territory of Hawaii from 1921 to 1929. Students from the popular T- Shirt Theater will then perform an original script, followed by a 30 member Lei Day court paying tribute to the many ethnic groups that make up the student population at Farrington.</p>

<p>There will be a second showing of the May Day celebration that is open to the community starting at 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. This will be the school’s second “green” event in partnership with Jack Johnson’s  Kokua Hawaii Foundation who will be collecting data that evening to measure the school’s carbon  footprint through food and beverage waste. All consumables will be properly disposed of in marked receptacles further educating the public about recycling and compost waste as methods of living sustainably.</p>

<p>Ample parking on campus and admission to the public event is $3.00. FHS students, faculty and FACF Board Members are free.</p>

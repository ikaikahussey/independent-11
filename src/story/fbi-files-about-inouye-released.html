<p>Newly released FBI files on Dan Inouye show that the Hawaii <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/09/16/19912-fbi-files-a-window-opens-on-the-life-and-times-of-dan-inouye/">senator</a> was subject to several anonymous death threats during his long service in Washington. He was also accused of accepting bribes to help Matson Navigation control shipping to Honolulu, and to secure a military research center at the University of Hawaii.</p>

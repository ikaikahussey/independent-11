<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.&#8212;Hawaii Congresswoman Mazie Hirono announced the awarding of a $331,137 U.S. Department of Labor grant to Maui Economic Opportunity, Inc. for the purpose of assisting low-income farm workers by paying for their job training, educational costs, housing assistance, and in some cases childcare.</p>

<p>The grant is awarded through the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP). The NFJP is a nationally-directed program of job training and employment assistance for migrant and seasonal farm workers that helps these workers acquire new job skills in occupations that offer higher wages and more stable employment, or upgrades their existing agricultural job skills. Family members of eligible farm workers may also be eligible for this assistance.</p>

<p>NFJP in Hawaii has assisted macadamia nut pickers, coffee growers, pineapple harvesters, and flower nursery workers, along with their families.</p>

<p>Maui Economic Opportunity (MEO) encourages Hawaii residents statewide who have been employed as an agricultural worker over the past two years to apply for this assistance. Anyone who believes they may be eligible to participate in this farm worker jobs program is urged to call MEO at (808) 249-2970 on Maui. The statewide toll free number is 1-877-795-4354. The MEO website is <a href="http://meoinc.charityfinders.org" title="http://meoinc.charityfinders.org">http://meoinc.charityfinders.org</a>.</p>

<p>In all, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the awarding of $78,410,000 for 2010 National Farm worker Jobs Program grants, nationwide.</p>

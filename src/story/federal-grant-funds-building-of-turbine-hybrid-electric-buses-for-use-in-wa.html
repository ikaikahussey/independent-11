<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu has been awarded a $5 million grant to replace diesel buses in Waikiki with turbine hybrid-electric buses that are quieter, more fuel-efficient, and produce lower emissions.</p>

<p>Honolulu’s project was selected on a competitive basis through a green transit initiative called the Transit Investments for Greenhouse Gas and Energy Reduction (TIGGER II) Program.</p>

<p>The program is a result of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2010, which appropriated $75 million for grants to public transit agencies for capital investments that will reduce the energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions of their public transportation systems.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Honolulu’s project objectives are to:</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Reduce Greenhouse gases and energy consumption on one of the busiest bus routes in Honolulu;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Increase the livability and vitality of Waikiki, a major tourist destination, employment center and residential area, by operating quiet, low-emission turbine buses through this densely populated area;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Evaluate the performance of a 45-foot bus in Waikiki allowing a reduction in the number of bus trips;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Evaluate the use of electrically-powered components including A/C system, air compressor, and power steering pump;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Eliminate the use, and disposal of, engine oil, transmission fluids, and engine coolant;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Improve service reliability;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Compare turbine hybrid buses with conventional hybrid buses and with conventional diesel buses;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Reduce operations and maintenance costs;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Prepare an evaluation report which will be used nationwide to advance the knowledge of innovative technologies in transit systems.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Farmers, community leaders, and individuals have pointed to the fact that over 85 percent of Hawaii’s food imported.</p>

<p>The impact of that statistic is compounded by current trends that include: the rezoning of agricultural land for non-ag developments, obstacles impeding the success of Hawaii&#8217;s small farmers, and a lack of political action to secure the resources needed for sustainable agriculture.</p>

<p>The Hawaii Farmers Union says that if current trends continue, Hawaii’s last agricultural lands will be gone by 2040.</p>

<p>What does the future hold for our state? What can Hawaii residents do to change these trends?</p>

<p>Luxury fashion house <a href="http://fendi.com/" target="_blank">Fendi, N.A.</a> is introducing a series of two separate unique design projects with local artists Eli Baxter and Aaron Padilla to launch Fendi&#8217;s design-focused &#8220;Fatto a Mano for the Future&#8221; (handmade for the future) platform in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The venture combines old world artisanship and modern day techniques through the collaboration, support, and perpetuation of emerging contemporary artists. Hawaii artists Eli Baxter and Aaron Padilla were selected  competitively among a pool of University of Hawaii alumni and graduate students of Art. Baxter and Padilla will work intimately with Fendi’s Roman Craftsman on site at respective boutique locations to build, cut, assemble, sew, and create contemporary design pieces that fuse each artist’s signature craft with Fendi&#8217;s Italian sensibilities and materials.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Baxter’s cerebral installations consisting of recycled bicycle tire rubber and Fendi Selleria leather explores scientific and philosophical concepts while focusing on raw materials and handcrafted details. Baxter creates spatial experiences through her conical, floral and intricate &#8220;creature-like&#8221; installations that mix her modern methods with Italian artisanship.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A master woodworker, Padilla manipulates natural wood segments into elegant woven and knotted sculptures. By constructing and deconstructing these pieces, Padilla organically incorporates Fendi Selleria leather to create modern designs with mixed textures.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Continuing the interactive experience, attendees are offered the opportunity to schedule private appointments with Fendi&#8217;s Roman Craftsman to create, customize, and purchase their own handbag throughout both events. In honor of alumni Baxter and Padilla, 20 percent of the event’s proceeds will benefit the UH&#8217;s Department of Art and Art History.</p>

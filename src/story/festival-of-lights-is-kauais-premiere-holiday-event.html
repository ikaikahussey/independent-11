<p>LIHUE&#8212;Downtown Lihue will be bustling with people Friday night as the annual Lights on Rice parade and Festival of Lights set the town aglow.</p>

<p>The event has become one of the yearly highlights on Kauaʻi, attracting some 5,000 persons who line Rice Street to watch floats, horses and dogs, all of them decorated with lights, make their way from Vidinha Stadium to the historic County Building, where the grounds will be illuminated by hundreds of thousands of lights.</p>

<p>The doors to the County Building also will be opened, allowing people to view the intricate and unique Christmas decorations made by the late Aunty Josie Chansky. For some 22 years on Oʻahu and another 18 on Kauaʻi, Chansky opened her home during the holidays so folks could enjoy her lavish displays. </p>

<p>Long before recycling became popular, Chanksy was turning egg cartons into wreaths, seed pods into table decorations, and wire coat hangars into chandeliers. She even crafted a Christmas tree from 7,500 green toothpicks. The distinctiveness of her folk art creations, and Chansky&#8217;s enthusiasm in sharing them, turned her Kapaʻa residence into a popular attraction known as &#8220;The Christmas House.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Chansky&#8217;s husband died in 1996, she realized she could not put up all the decorations herself, so she hosted a big garage sale. Recognizing their value, a Kauaʻi resident bought the entire collection and donated it to the county, which gave rise to the annual Festival of Lights celebration.</p>

<p>Volunteers spend many hours hanging Chansky&#8217;s hand-made ornaments on trees and decorating the two-story historic structure with her lighted displays. In the process, the government building is transformed into a true Christmas fantasy land. The public can tour the building between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights through December 24. Santa and Mrs. Claus are also on hand, as well as docents who can answer questions about the exhibit. There is no admission charge.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s event is especially poignant because Chansky, who was always on hand for the opening ceremonies, passed away last February. Prior to that, her contribution to the island&#8217;s holiday spirit was recognized through proclamations issued by state Sen. Gary Hooser, the late Mayor Bryan Baptiste, and Mayor Bernard Carvalho.</p>

<p>The Festival begins at 6 p.m. on Friday, December 4, with caroling by the Kauaʻi Chorale. It also includes a performance by the Kapaʻa Middle School Choir, the arrival of Santa Claus, and the lighting countdown. The parade begins at 6:30 p.m. and lasts about half an hour. The Kauaʻi Museum, which is located across from the County Building, will simultaneously be holding its annual craft fair, featuring the work of local artists. Food will be sold.</p>

<p>A free shuttle will run from the K-mart parking lot to the county building, starting at 5:30 p.m.</p>

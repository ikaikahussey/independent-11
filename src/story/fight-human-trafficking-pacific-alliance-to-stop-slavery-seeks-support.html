<p>Hawaii is now one of five states in the nation with no local law defining human trafficking and according to federal social workers is one of the worst states in the nation for child sex-trafficking.</p>

<p>The mission of Pacific Alliance to Stop Slavery (PASS) is to provide services and advocacy for survivors of human trafficking. PASS also provides education and training, public awareness, and legislative advocacy for the greater community to prevent the rise of human trafficking in Hawaii, all through volunteers.</p>

<p>Donors can help the 501(c)3 nonprofit organization by making a tax-deductible contribution. No amount is too small in helping to reunite a victim with her or his family; provide shelter, food, clothing, education, and healing for victims; and educate the community about ways to prevent human trafficking in neighborhoods statewide. </p>

<p>The massive molasses spill in Honolulu Harbor <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20130912__Molasses_damage_predicted_to_linger.html?id=223421801">earlier</a> this week, which has already killed thousands of coastal-dwelling fish, appears to be worse than state health officials originally thought.</p>

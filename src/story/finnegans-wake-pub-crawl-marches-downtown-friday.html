<p>DOWNTOWN&#8212;The Friends of Saint Patrick, one of Honolulu’s Irish community groups, will hold its annual “Finnegan’s Wake” pub crawl on Friday, June 17. The name comes from an Irish folk song about a man killed, and then resurrected, by whiskey. The song inspired James Joyce’s iconic novel of the same name.</p>

<p>The event begins at O’Toole’s Irish Pub at 4:30 p.m., and participants will wind their way through Downtown to each of Honolulu’s Irish pubs: Murphy’s Bar &amp; Grill, J.J. Dolan’s, and Ferguson’s Irish Pub. This year’s event has taken on special significance, with the recent passing of John Ferguson, beloved owner of Ferguson’s Irish Pub and longtime Honolulu publican.</p>

<p>Following “Finnegan’s Wake” on Saturday, June 18 will be the “Bloomsday Hangover Party” at O’Toole’s at 3:30 p.m.</p>

<p>FireWater Events is hosting a New Year&#8217;s Eve party at sea aboard the three-level catamaran <i>Alii Kai</i> on Friday, December 31. The event emcee will be Sean D, with DJ Mr. Nick and DJ Rayne performing on Level One. The live bands featured on Level Two will be 82fifty and GRLFRNDS.</p>

<p>This ocean-bound celebration will be serving up drink and food specials and a prime view of the midnight fireworks display at Aloha Tower. Bottle service and sushi packages are available for the cruise. Stylish attire is recommended for the maritime affair.</p>

<p>As several of FireWaterâ€™s previous events aboard the Alii Kai have sold out, organizers recommend that partygoers opt for the presale offer, which is $10 cheaper than presale tickets.</p>

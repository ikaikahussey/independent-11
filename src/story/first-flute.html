<p>From INhonolulu Mag:</p><blockquote><p>Not resting on his laurels, Galway displays his magic flute constantly, in a steady stream of concerts that has covered every continent but South America so far. Along the way, he has developed a secondary passion for teaching, seeing music as crucial to the development of truly bright human beings.</p>

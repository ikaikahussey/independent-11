<p>MANOA &#8212; This Saturday, July 2, the <a href="http://waikikihcc.org/" target="_blank">Waikīkī Hawaiian Civic Club</a> will host its third Fish and Poi event at <a href="http://manoa.hawaii.edu/hshk/index.php/site/acad_kanewai/en/" target="_blank">Ka Papa Loʻi Kānewai</a> at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The goal of the Fish and Poi event is to create opportunities for the sharing and utilization of indigenous wisdom between Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners and native Hawaiian foster, legal guardianship, and adoptive families to facilitate the exchange, preservation and transmission of traditional knowledge relating to traditional food traditions, cultivation, harvesting, and preparation.</p>

<p>The Native Hawaiian foster, legal guardianship, and adoptive families will have the opportunity to experience traditional farming methods, converse with Hawaiian Language speakers, talk story with practitioners, learn to clean fish and prepare it for drying, listen to a moʻolelo about making Hawaiian salt on the island of Kauaʻi and enjoy the day with family and friends.</p>

<p>The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), Hawaiʻi Maoli, and Ka Papa Loʻi ʻo Kānewai are sponsoring the Fish and Poi event.</p>

<p>Waikīkī Hawaiian Civic Club (WHCC) is a chartered member of the Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs since 1964. WHCC is dedicated to the promotion and perpetuation of traditional native Hawaiian values and practices and has a long history of involvement in diverse areas including native health, education, and the environment. It has also been involved with several Hawaiian language immersion projects relating to native language and cultural practices.</p>

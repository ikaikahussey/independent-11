<p>Aloha:<br />
We&#8217;ve been having problems with a service that we were using to automatically post our stories to Twitter and Facebook. We&#8217;re trying a new solution now, which should fix the problem. If you run into a bad URL, please shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:help@hawaiiindependent.net">help@hawaiiindependent.net</a>.</p>

<p>Mahalo!</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Big waves and storm clouds are passing through the islands going into Wednesday, January 19.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Watch is in effect for Hawaii Island and Maui. A cold low aloft will move southward over Maui and Hawaii Island late Tuesday, January 18 and continue through the following day bringing the threat of heavy showers and thunderstorms that may produce flash flooding.</p>

<p>The Flash Flood Watch remains in effect from midnight tonight through Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding. Monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action should Flash Flood Warnings be issued.</p>

<p>A High Surf Warning is in effect from noon on Wednesday, January 19 to noon on Friday, January 21. </p>

<p>Surf will increase rapidly Wednesday afternoon and evening, reaching 30 to 40 feet along north and west facing shores of Kauai, 25 to 35 feet along Oahu&#8217;s North Shore, and 20 to 30 feet along west shores of Oahu as well as north shores of Molokai and Maui.</p>

<p>The swell will reach Kauai first, building rapidly Wednesday afternoon as it spreads to islands farther to the east.</p>

<p>The incoming swell has a westerly component that will produce larger-than-normal surf along west facing shores. Some wave run-up is possible along Leeward Oahu. This will result in very dangerous ocean conditions and deadly rip currents.</p>

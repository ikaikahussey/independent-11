<p><em>Honiara, Solomon Islands</em></p><blockquote><p> <br />
Following the devastating flash floods that struck the Solomon Islands in April, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal for 1.3 million Swiss Francs (USD 1.4 million, AUD 1.59 million) to help the Solomon Islands Red Cross Society continue to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance to more than 20,000 people.<br />
 <br />
It is one month since the worst floods in the Pacific nation’s history killed 22 people, destroyed homes and properties and severely disrupted the lives of more than 50,000 people - 10 percent of the country’s population - in the capital Honiara and surrounding plains in Guadalcanal Province.<br />
 <br />
“One month on, the needs are still great - more than 4,000 remain in emergency shelters in Honiara and thousands of families face months of recovery ahead to try to return to their normal lives,” says Solomon Islands Red Cross Society Deputy Secretary General Joanne Zoleveke.<br />
 <br />
“More emergency support is still very-much needed to provide basic relief supplies, such as clean water, sanitation and emergency shelter, but we’re also looking at how to help people for the longer term to rebuild their homes and lives,” says Manuri.<br />
 <br />
Red Cross now has a 90-strong team of volunteers, as well as local and international emergency staff working around the clock. Water and<br />
sanitation teams have so far purified and delivered more than 1 million liters of clean water to evacuation centres in Honiara and the rural communities in Guadalcanal Plains. We have designed and contributed materials for the construction of 80 latrines in the evacuation centres,<br />
continue to build hand-washing stands and spread messages on the importance of good hygiene practices to prevent waterborne diseases.<br />
 <br />
Teams have so far delivered essential non-food items to more than 5,000 people in Honiara and Guadalcanal Plains, including tarps and tools,<br />
jerry cans, kitchen equipment, hygiene materials, bedding and mosquito nets.<br />
 <br />
The IFRC Emergency Appeal will enable Solomon Islands Red Cross Society to deliver humanitarian assistance to 21,000 people over the next nine months, including safe drinking water and sanitation, shelter kits, essential supplies and hygiene kits, as well as carrying out disease prevention and health promotion.</p>

<p>Dear Candidates:</p>

<p>Hawaii imports a staggering 85%-90% of the food we consume, which puts us at risk from natural disasters and other shipping disruptions, according to a 2008 Department of Agriculture <a href="http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/add/White Paper D14.pdf/">study</a>. This issue has taken on a new urgency in light of recent Land Use Commission decisions to allow the development of agricultural lands in â€˜Ewa.</p>

<p>We&#8217;d like to know how you&#8217;d address Hawaii&#8217;s food insecurity. Is it an issue you&#8217;d work on? If so, how?</p>

<p>Candidates are welcome to respond in the discussion section below.</p>

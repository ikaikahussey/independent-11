<p>The Hawaii Independent received the following email from David Kimo Frankel, the attorney representing Paulette Kaleikini in the rail archeology lawsuit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is our understanding that the City has halted construction of the rail project. The City would like to:&nbsp; (1) complete a few short-term tasks for public safety (e.g., backfilling a trench) (2) continue longer-term maintenance activities (e.g., erosion control measures) (3) complete the archaeological inventory survey and (4) miscellaneous activities.&nbsp; The City is currently working on a list that would describe these activities with specificity.&nbsp; Attorneys for Paulette Kaleikini and the City are in discussions regarding whether any of these activities should be allowed to proceed.<br />
 <br />
For all intents and purposes, construction of the project has been halted although there may be some narrowly tailored, low-impact exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:00 pm</strong><br />
HART officials are drafting a statement, which we&#8217;ll publish as soon as it&#8217;s available.</p>

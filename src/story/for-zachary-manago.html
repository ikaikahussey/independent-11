<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Pre-game rituals are not uncommon among sports teams. But none are more heartfelt or have deeper meaning than that of the Hawaii Pacific University baseball team.</p>

<p>Before the start of each game, the Sea Warrior squad gathers at the middle of the outfield, says a short prayer, and collectively shouts, “Ride to the top!” </p>

<p>“It’s something we say to remember what the season is for and to remember that we are playing for our boy that didn’t get a chance to play,” said senior Lester Akeo.</p>

<p>The words are much more than a saying, but a mantra of remembrance for a fallen comrade. Before the start of the season, Zachary Manago, a redshirt freshman on the team, died in <a href="http://www.khon2.com/mostpopular/story/Over-1-000-People-Attend-Memorial-for-18-year-old/upPg9hEZ_k-K6bq2EICvnA.cspx" target="_blank">a hit-and-run incident</a> while riding his bike. His death not only shocked the entire Hawaii baseball community, but forged the 2011 Sea Warrior team into a close knit fraternity of brothers.</p>

<p>“We are super close. We are a family and we bond together,” said redshirt freshman Keanu Kapana, who played with Manago since he was 12-years-old. “Before what happened at the beginning of the season, we had groups of guys that were super close. And now we are all on the same page.”</p>

<p>To go along with the emotional roller coaster ride at the beginning of the year, this season has had its share of ups and downs. After dropping eight of their first 10 games, the team hit a mid-season surge all the way to the top of the Pac-West. Through all of this, Coach Garrett Yukumoto has preached the team’s camaraderie.</p>

<p>“The team chemistry has grown from the beginning of the season till today. There is more cohesiveness, which in turn makes us a little more victorious,” Yukumoto said. “They dedicated the season to Zach and I told them, ‘if you’re going to dedicate a season to someone, then you need to put your heart and soul into it’.”</p>

<p>The death of a team member can no doubt have harsh emotional effects on a group’s psyche and mentality, but there have been a steady number of leaders on the team who stepped up and made sure everyone is on the right track to help the Sea Warriors go far. Aside from Akeo and Kapana, Coach “Yuks” also tabbed Chad Bolibol and Kale Sumner as positive contributors to the team.</p>

<p>“I think with their leadership roles, they are taking the lead to have the team bond as one and they aren’t showing it by mouth,&#8221; Yukumoto said. &#8220;It’s more by expectation and work ethic.&nbsp; That’s basically leading by example.&#8221;</p>

<p>Akeo, an infielder who is in his final year, loves the leadership role that comes with seniority and said this season’s group is unlike any other he has been on in his time at HPU.</p>

<p>“This is probably the closest team I’ve been on since I’ve been here,” Akeo said. “This team is a little younger so I want to take the lead and show the younger guys how it is to get back to the regionals.”</p>

<p>On the way to the Downtown Honolulu campus, going Koko Head bound, there is a mural dedicated to Manago’s memory of him riding his bicycle. The words above the painting of Manago read: “Ride in paradise.” The artwork is another touching tribute to someone who was not only seen as a great teammate, but an even greater friend.</p>

<p>Whether the team is at home or on the road chasing another Pac West title, each and every number on the roster knows No. 29 will always be riding alongside them ... helping them get to the top.</p>

<p>HONOLULU –&nbsp; Former news anchor and philanthropy executive Kim Gennaula has been tapped to replace Susan Au Doyle as President and Chief Professional Officer of Aloha United Way starting June 13, 2011.&nbsp; She will be responsible for leading, managing and directing the organization’s efforts to fulfill its mission to improve lives, motivate people to help others, increase resources to meet needs and inspire collective solutions to community problems.</p>

<p>Most recently, Gennaula served as Philanthropy Director at Kapiolani Health Foundation, where she was responsible for cultivating, soliciting and stewarding donors for Kapiolani Medical Center’s operations and hospital programs.&nbsp; Prior to that, she served as News Anchor at KGMB-TV from 1993 to 2008.&nbsp; Gennaula also has experience creating and managing Communications Departments for Liberty House and The Sharper Image.</p>

<p>Appointed in April by Governor Neil Abercrombie to serve on the Board of Education, Gennaula is also a volunteer member on two public school reform committees.&nbsp; A frequent emcee at non-profit functions and fundraisers, she has additionally volunteered her time with the March of Dimes and Angel Network.</p>

<p>“It was a very difficult decision to leave The Kapiolani Health Foundation, but I do so knowing that the great momentum we’ve been experiencing will continue and result in a tremendous future for the hospital and its mission,” said Gennaula.&nbsp; “I am pleased and honored to join the Aloha United Way team. It is the beginning of a new era where we will think creatively to develop new strategies that support our donors, our non-profit partners and the businesses who work with us to help the community.&nbsp; In this economy, our non-profits need us more than ever, and we will be committed to finding innovative ways to assist in that fundraising effort to help even more agencies.”</p>

<p>Laura Pitolo, age 37, was charged yesterday with 6 felony theft counts for improperly diverting more than $500,000.00 in state funds from Waianae Community Outreach for use by herself, family members and friends, Attorney General Doug Chin announced. </p>

<p>“The charges against Pitolo are the result of over seven months of investigation conducted by special agents for the Attorney General into the misuse of state funds at Waianae Community Outreach,” said Deputy Attorney General Michael Kagami of the Criminal Justice Division. “The evidence uncovered indicates Ms. Pitolo diverted a substantial amount of state funds for personal use.” </p>

<p>“Hawaii citizens trust that their hard-earned tax dollars will be used to make communities better and not help one person get rich,” said Chin. “The amount allegedly stolen here is extremely serious.” </p>

<p>Waianae Community Outreach received funding from the state of Hawaii to serve homeless individuals. Pitolo was the program director at the time the thefts occurred. Pitolo was charged with five counts of first degree theft, each punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine, and one count of second degree theft, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Pitolo is presumed innocent unless and until she is found guilty of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Green, yellow and red may soon apply to more than traffic lights. Those colors would telegraph how a restaurant or other food establishment fared in its most recent safety inspection, according to changes being proposed by the state Department of Health. <a href="http://westhawaiitoday.com/sections/news/local-news/inspection-changes-could-be-menu.html">West Hawaii Today.</a></p>

The state is piloting a free laptop rental program that’s already available at 36 public libraries across Hawaii.&nbsp; The netbooks, which can be rented out by any library cardholder for three weeks at a time, are equipped with broadband capacities and don’t need to have access to WiFi to connect to the internet. <a href="http://hawaii.news.blogs.civilbeat.com/post/64315145978/hawaii-public-libraries-renting-out-laptops-with-mobile">Civil Beat.</a></p>

<p>The University of Hawaii is considering halting new construction projects across the university system until it can rein in a repair and maintenance backlog that has ballooned to nearly a half-billion dollars. The idea was presented at Thursday&#8217;s Board of Regents meeting by Regent Benjamin Kudo, who said an &#8220;interim self-imposed moratorium&#8221; on new construction would give the board breathing room to address the needed repairs. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131018_UH_broaches_construction_freeze.html?id=228311561">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>The University of Hawaii’s controversial plans to develop a $27.5 million center dedicated to the late Sen. Daniel Inouye are being stalled because the UH administration now wants to ask the Legislature for just $5 million for the project — not $15 million as originally pencilled out in the university’s supplemental budget proposal. <a href="http://hawaii.news.blogs.civilbeat.com/post/64330174875/uh-slashing-daniel-inouye-center-budget-request-from">Civil Beat.</a></p>

<p>Deferring to the wishes of the late U.S. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye&#8217;s family and addressing transparency concerns, the University of Hawaii is slowing the process for pursuing a planned center to house his congressional papers and has dramatically cut the state funding it is initially requesting for the project. The university&#8217;s Board of Regents on Thursday approved seeking $5 million in state bond financing as a way to demonstrate UH&#8217;s commitment to the project — a commitment that proponents said was needed to help in efforts to raise more private funds. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131018_UH_agrees_to_hold_off_on_center_for_Inouye.html?id=228311771">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>State Department of Health officials in the past week have identified five more cases of liver damage that could have been caused by consuming a dietary supplement — bringing the current total to 34. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131018_5_more_cases_of_liver_damage_emerge_in_Hawaii.html?id=228296591">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

Oahu</p>

<p>Board members overseeing the city&#8217;s rail project Thursday approved its largest capital budget yet, clearing rail officials to sign $1.56 billion in contracts in the coming fiscal year to build the project. The move comes after construction resumed in September on the 20-mile elevated rail system — the largest public works project in Hono­lulu&#8217;s history. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131018_board_approves_largest_budget_yet_hart_gets_go_ahead_to_spend_1pt56b_on_rail_structures.html?id=228315091">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>Crews have replaced sand that eroded away from a spot at Waikiki Beach. Bulldozers and other equipment were brought in for the Thursday night project, timed to coincide with a very low tide. <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/23724660/crews-replacing-sand-at-erosion-spot-in-waikiki">Hawaii News Now.</a></p>

<p>Major repair work is just about to begin on one of the most popular beaches in the world. Crews are about to fix the erosion at Kuhio Beach in Waikiki. But it&#8217;s just one of many beaches across the state facing this problem. <a href="http://www.khon2.com/news/waikiki-beach-only-one-of-many-eroding-away">KHON2.</a></p>

<p>A federal judge sentenced retired Honolulu police Maj. Carlton Nishimura to eight months in jail Thursday for lying to the FBI and filing a false 2005 income tax return. Nishimura had also been charged with extortion conspiracy and drug promotion. Nishimura was indicted in February 2011 by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiring to accept bribes from illegal gambling operators in exchange for steering officers away from the gaming rooms. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131018_Former_police_officer_sentenced_to_8_months_in_prison.html?id=228312051">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>Hawaii</p>

<p>A recently published study by University of Toronto researchers links the number of sharks on a reef to the reef’s health, with more sharks indicating a healthier reef. The proposed West Hawaii fisheries rules package, still awaiting Gov. Neil Abercrombie’s signature, included provisions to protect nine species of inshore sharks and rays, as well as two invertebrate crown-of-thorns predators. <a href="http://westhawaiitoday.com/sections/news/local-news/survey-cites-sharks%E2%80%99-importance-protecting-reefs.html">West Hawaii Today.</a></p>

<p>Administrators are hoping that by scaling back plans for the proposed Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy building, they may render the project more palatable to state legislators. <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/sections/news/local-news/officials-hope-scaled-down-plans-garner-more-support-pharmacy-school.html">Tribune-Herald.</a></p>

<p>Maui</p>

<p>Proposed limits for Maui and Lanai fisheries on popular near-shore fish are drawing criticism from those who argue that the rules would disrupt Native Hawaiian cultural traditions. A community meeting organized by the state Department of Land and Natural Resources to explain the proposals drew about 100 people to Maui Waena Intermediate School on Wednesday. The changes would involve bag and size limits for fish including goatfish, parrotfish and jacks. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20131018__Proposed_fishing_limits_elicit_criticism_on_Maui.html?id=228307471">Associated Press.</a></p>

<p>Kauai</p>

<p>The Kauai County Council sent Bill 2491 to the mayor&#8217;s office for approval.&nbsp; Under the measure, large agribusinesses would be required to disclose restricted-used pesticides applied in fields and implement buffer zones near schools, homes, medical facilities, public roadways and waterways. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20131017_Kauai_Council_sends_pesticides_bill_to_mayor.html?id=228288061">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

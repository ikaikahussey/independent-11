<p>A state circuit judge Thursday declined to stop a marriage equality bill from becoming law but appeared open to hearing whether expanding marriage to gay couples violates the state Constitution. Judge Karl Sakamoto rejected a request by state Rep. Bob McDermott for a temporary restraining order to prevent Gov. Neil Abercrombie from signing a bill into law and the state from issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131108_Judge_open_to_claim_from_opponents.html?id=231108531">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>Oahu Circuit Judge Karl Sakamoto refused on Thursday, November 7, to issue a temporary restraining order against the Hawaii Legislature to prevent lawmakers from legalizing gay marriage. The lawsuit, filed by Rep. Bob McDermott, a Republican, centered on a 1998 ballot issue on same-sex marriage. <a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/lawsuit-fails-to-stop-hawaii-legislature-from-passing-gay-marriage-legislation/123">Hawaii Reporter.</a></p>

<p>State senators are inclined to agree to the state House&#8217;s version of a marriage equality bill rather than take the debate into conference committee. The House is expected to vote today on a bill that would allow gay couples to marry as soon as Dec. 2 but would broaden a religious exemption for churches and religious organizations that do not want to be involved in gay weddings. If the House approves the bill, it could be heard by the Senate on Tuesday. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131108__Senate_leans_toward_House_form_of_bill.html?id=231108571">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>What: Friends of Kehau ALOHA JAM Benefit <br />
 <br />
When: Friday March 5th, 2010 from 4-10 p.m.</p>

<p>Join a collection of Hawaii&#8217;s best musicians, special guests and a Surf Art showing at one of Honolulu&#8217;s coolest venues - the Hard Rock Cafe. They will come together to support the Friends of Kehau Sullivan at the inaugural &#8216;Friends of Kehau ALOHA JAM Benefit&#8217;. </p>

<p>Friends of Kehau Sullivan are delighted to collaborate with &#8220;Music is Good Medicine&#8221; represented by Jake Shimabukuro, with its mission: to use the power of music to heal, influence and inspire people to improve our community, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and pursue their dreams with a positive attitude. </p>

<p>Kehau is the youngest daughter of North Shore surfer Pancho Sullivan, who was born with a congenital heart condition that required surgery less than 24 hours after her birth. The medical requirements including at least four additional surgeries for Baby Kehau has the Sullivan family faced with an out-of-pocket cost of at least $150,000 after insurance payments.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The night aims to raise money for Pancho and Haunani Sullivan&#8217;s baby girl, Kehau&#8217;s Medical Fund and the Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) who provide a home-away-from-home for children and their families while the child is treated for serious, often life-threatening illnesses at hospitals. All of the proceeds raised on the night will go directly to Kehau&#8217;s Medical Fund with a donation made on behalf of the Sullivan family to RMHC.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Artists: Tavana, Keith Batlin, Dion &#8220;Boogie&#8221; Scott, Jake Shimabukuro, Brother Noland, Starr Kalahiki, Anjj Lee, Mike Love, Johnny Helm, Guy Cruz, John Cruz, Micah Wolf, Pat &#8216;the Hat&#8217;, and other special guests. <br />

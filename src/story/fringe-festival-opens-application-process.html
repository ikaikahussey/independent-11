<p>The Oahu Fringe Festival, part of the international Fringe arts festivals, is moving into its third year.</p>

<p>The upcoming <a href="http://oahufringe.com">Oahu Fringe Festival</a> runs from November 7 – 10, 2013.</p>

<p>The Fringe festivals began in 1947 in Edinburgh, Scotland. From the Edinburgh Fringe <a href="http://www.edfringe.com/">website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our story dates back to 1947, when eight theatre groups turned up uninvited to perform at the (then newly formed) Edinburgh International Festival, an initiative created to celebrate and enrich European cultural life in the wake of the Second World War. Not being part of the official programme of the International festival didn’t stop these performers – they just went ahead and staged their shows anyway. Year on year more and more performers followed their example and in 1958 the Festival Fringe Society was created in response to the success of this growing trend.</p>

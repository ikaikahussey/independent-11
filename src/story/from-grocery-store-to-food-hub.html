<p>George Costa, Kaua‘i county&#8217;s economic development director, has a great idea for the former Big Save location in Lihu‘e, which has been vacant for nearly two years: turn it into a community food center.</p>

<p> Léo Azambuja of The Garden Island reports:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For quite sometime, Costa had been looking for a place with a commercial kitchen to provide a growing number of local farmers the ability to turn their produce into value-added products. There are many commercial kitchens on Kaua‘i, but the problem was finding one willing to rent out space to third parties, he said.</p>

<p>Costa was also looking for a meat-processing facility. The initial plans were for a slaughterhouse, but there are already two established local facilities, and the county didn’t want to displaced them, he said. However, there is still a need for the thriving local ranchers to process the meat from their cattle and other animals.</p>

<p>Retail space for Kaua‘i Grown and Kaua‘i Made products was another piece of the puzzle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s just an idea at this point, but it&#8217;s consistent with the macro trends: diversification, localized production, farm to table. It&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

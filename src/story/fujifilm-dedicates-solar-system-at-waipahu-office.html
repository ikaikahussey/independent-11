<p>WAIPAHU&#8212;<a href="http://www.fujifilmusa.com/northamerica/" target="_blank">Fujifilm North America Corporation</a> hosted a traditional Hawaiian dedication ceremony yesterday at its regional office in Waipahu, Hawaii to commemorate the installation of <a href="http://www.conergy.us/" target="_blank">Conergy</a>â€™s premium solar panel PowerPlus system, by local clean-energy integrator, <a href="http://smartenergyhawaii.com/" target="_blank">21st Century Technologies</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The solar installation will produce 483,391 kWh annually, which is equivalent to reducing CO2 emissions by 1.11 million lbs per year or powering 66 households per year. It is the first Conergy PowerPlus plant installed in the U.S., and is one of the top ten largest solar power systems on Oahu.</p>

<p>Hawaii Sen. Mike Gabbard was in attendance to personally present solar energy awards to the three companies. Also in attendance were State Representatives Denny Coffman of District 6 and Henry Aquino of District 35; Tim Ming, from the DBEDT Energy Division; and Kazunari Tanaka, Deputy Consulate General, and Yukako Asamura, Economic Affairs Section, Consulate General of Japan in Honolulu.</p>

<p>With this installation, Fujifilm will realize a substantial cost savings on its current energy usage. In addition, the company will be able to take advantage of the utilities net energy metering program, which will provide ongoing benefits. Globally, Fujifilm has a Greenhouse gas target set at 30% reduction in CO2 emissions by Fiscal Year 2020.</p>

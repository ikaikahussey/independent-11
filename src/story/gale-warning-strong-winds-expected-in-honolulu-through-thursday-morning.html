<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The National Weather Service in Honolulu issued a gale warning through Thursday, October 28 at 6:00 a.m. </p>

<p>A gale warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or occurring. Operating an ocean vessel in gale conditions requires experience and properly equipped vessels. Mariners without the proper vessel and experience should remain in port until the gale conditions end.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service says to expect winds of 25 to 35 knots with locally higher gusts.</p>

<p>The small craft advisory is no longer in effect.</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, the Capitol rotunda reverberated with the sound of beating hula pahu, leading to the defeat of Malama Solomon&#8217;s bill which would have required Hawaiian cultural practitioners to be registered.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the rhythm of the kuâ€˜i kalo was different, but there was a cadence of movement, as hundreds gathered in a convocation of various groups coming together to push for labeling of genetically modified foods.</p>

<p>A group of about 60 gathered early in the morning to march from the University of Hawaii to the Capitol. That group gathered people along the three-mile route, accumulating charter schools and the De-Occupy Honolulu contingent. By the time the marching group made it to Miller St, they were able to swell into the rotunda, in a gathering that some have speculated is in the top three of all rallies at the Capitol building.</p>

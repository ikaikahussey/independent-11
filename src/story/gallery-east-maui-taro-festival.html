<p>Parents and keiki gathered to hear favorite mo’olelo or learn how to make lomi lomi sticks and kapa.&nbsp; Lei Ishikawa of Pukalani began pounding kapa seventeen years ago, responding to a call to make kapa for the reinterment of na iwi kupuna that had been displaced.&nbsp; At the Taro Festival, Lei explained how to scrape away the ‘ili, make a cut with a niho māno (shark-tooth knife), peel away the bast and pound it with a hohoa on a kua pōhaku (stone anvil).&nbsp; Lei also demonstrated beating with the wooden i’e kuku on the kua la’au (wooden anvil) and the final step of applying a watermark to the kapa. </p>

<p>Bright sunshine and a light breeze created a perfect day to enjoy cultural presentations, ono grinds, agricultural exhibits, crafts vendors and community information tables.&nbsp; Community organizers included Mahealani and Ed Wendt of Kaenae with Kana’iolowalu, the Native Hawaiian Roll; Cynthia Rodriguez, the new executive director of ‘Ohana Makamae Inc. family resource center; Aunt Tweetie Lind and Scott Crawford of Kipahulu ‘Ohana and Kapahu Living Farm; and representatives of the Hana Community Endowment Fund.&nbsp; Barry Chang, <br />
President of Hana Canoe Club, and other club volunteers were on hand to get the word out about the upcoming Hana Sarah-Joe Regatta, featuring a 5-mile distance race around Alau Island and inshore sprints.&nbsp; The Taro Security and Purity Task Force offered samples of several varieties of ono Hawaiian taro and explained how a combination of heavy rain, drought, the high cost of water and the need for more land dedicated to taro have reduced production in Hawai’i.&nbsp; The Task Force is working with UH College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources to survey growing practices across the Hawaiian islands, including a free soil and taro quality report for participating growers. </p>

<p>Performing artists at the Festival included Kaui Kanaka’ole’s Halau Hula, Uncle Richard Ho’opi’i, and Ola Hou.&nbsp; Many played the songs of Hana-born Pekelo Cosma, the Na Hoku Hanohano Award-winning songwriter and master of Hawaiian slack key who died in 2011.&nbsp; Pekelo’s young daughters Nakama and Elle danced hula and sang, with many smiles greeting Nakama’s strong, clear voice.&nbsp; The crowd applauded and cheered spontaneous hula by friends and beloved kupuna, including Auntie Julia from Moloka’i.&nbsp; Maui’s own Willie K provided the musical crescendo for a great day in Hana.</p>

<p>The festivities continued on Sunday with a taro pancake breakfast at Hana Bay, sponsored by the Hana Business Council, followed by tours of Kahanu Garden and the Hale O Pi’ilani Heiau, Mahele Farm at ‘Ula’ino, and a lo’i excursion to Kapahu Living Farm in Kipahulu.</p>

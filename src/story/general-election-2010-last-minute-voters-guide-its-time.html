<div class="pull-black">On to the issues</div>

<p><br />
Here&#8217;s a slice of what&#8217;s been going on leading up to the General Election: <i>The Hawaii Independent</i>&#8216;s recent campaign commentary, candidate interviews, and other handy links to check out before heading to the polls. </p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/democracy-unlike-this-campaign-season-has-to-be-issues-driven/" title="Democracy, unlike this campaign season, has to be issues-driven">Democracy, unlike this campaign season, has to be issues-driven</a></b><br />
First up, <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> columnist and Hawaii Public Radio host Beth-Ann Kozlovich reminds us that while the campaign season is catapulting issues, facts, and insults to front pages and back rooms, these days, it’s tough not to think or be talking about some of them.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/in-search-of-real-security-part-one/" title="In Search of Real Security, Part One: A closer look at our basic needs in a time of crisis">In Search of Real Security</a></b><br />
With the issues in mind, Jon Letman reported on a discussion on Kauai in August that explored the impacts of a U.S. economy too intensely focused on its military operations overseas. Real security, it was said, will come when Hawaii is not dominated by military spending but instead supports more immediate human needs: health, education, preservation of the environment, sustainable energy, and fostering a culture the builds rather than destroys.</p>

The Hawaii Independent had two very polar views on Hawaii’s governor’s race. Recently released poll numbers have Gary Hooser, the former State Senate Majority Leader who has represented Kauai and Niihau since 2002, baffled at growing support for Republican gubernatorial candidate Duke Aiona. And conservative commentator Steve Jackson is equally concerned about Democratic candidate Neil Abercrombie’s plans for bigger government.</p>

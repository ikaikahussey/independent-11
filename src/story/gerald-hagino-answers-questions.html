<p>WAHIAWA&#8212;There are currently 5 candidates in the Senate District 22 race as of the Office of Elections Candidate Report on August 4. </p>

<p>District 22 is comprised of Mililani Mauka, Wahiawa, Haleiwa, Mokuleia, and North Shore.</p>

<p><i>The Hawaii Independent</i> submitted questions to each candidate. Responses will be published in the order in which they are received.</p>

<p>Candidate Gerald Hagino is a former State senator and held the District 22 seat until losing it in 1993 to Robert Bunda, who resigned this year to run for lieutenant governor.</p>

<p><b>Why are you running for office?</b><br />
Politically, we need to return to the basics. We need to have public servants who will place the public before they vote themselves a raise. We need public officials who have no ulterior motives or hidden agendas.&nbsp; The community deserves a Senator who will be visible in the community more than just before election time.</p>

<p><b> What is the single most important issue for your constituents?</b><br />
Education, no more furloughs. Every thing begins with education. </p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
Strengthen Act 55 so that appropriated money goes to where it was intended. Provide a safe environment for students.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
95% of my campaign funds come from my family. I owe my allegiance to no one but them and constituents.</p>

<p><b>Who do you plan on including in your staff?</b><br />
Need to get past Primary and General [Elections] before I can even consider thinking about staff.</p>

<p><b>What’s your strategy in dealing with the homeless?</b><br />
Look for a site to provide shelter and services. Need to look at alternatives such as small and inexpensive alternatives. Japan, a country familiar with limited space has attractive small dwellings that we should look at.</p>

<p><b>What’s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
I support the rail. We have the funding mechanism in place.</p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for HB 444?</b><br />
Against. No.</p>

<p><b>Do you support the Akaka Bill?</b><br />
Yes.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
Elect responsible people who will make them believe that government is for the people and will be responsive to their concerns. Listen to what the community is saying. Help the ones who don&#8217;t know where to go to resolve their problem.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii’s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Devote more resources to help small business. We have very few big industries here and many of them have no roots here. Their decisions are strictly based on cash inflow. Small business grew because they saw a need or had a product that we wanted. We need to realize that they really are the backbone of the economy and should be helping them to survive. Helping small business has a filter down effect of helping other businesses.</p>

<p><b>How do we solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem?</b><br />
You help lower the number of unemployed by having a healthy economy that has an environment that makes new ventures want to do business here.</p>

<p><b>What is the biggest issue Wahiawa town is facing?</b><br />
Revitalizing the community. We are not a sleepy community that time has passed by. We are more than just a drive through to get to another destination. We need to find a way to lessen the impact felt when troops are deployed overseas.</p>

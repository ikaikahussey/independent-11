<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Get your team together for this year&#8217;s great adventure through Honolulu. Hawaii Theatre Center’s Fifth Annual Chinatown Chase returns to Bethel Street on February 19. </p>

<p>The adventure begins at the Hawaii Theatre, where teams of eight&#8212;often garbed in creative costumes&#8212;gather for pre-Chase libations and a healthy dose of smack talk. Then, armed with packets of clues, maps, and gadgets they set off on a romp through the urban grottos of Chinatown and the Honolulu Culture and Arts District in an all-out quest to the finish line. </p>

<p>Along the way they will have to unravel riddles and perform daring (or foolish) feats. Besides ultimate bragging rights, the top three teams will be rewarded with prizes, with the first-place team enjoying a stay at their choice of Four Seasons Resort Lanai properties.</p>

<p>All of the participants will enjoy the smoldering party on Bethel Street after the Chase, where hoards of tasty nibbles and libations will re-fuel the adventurous crowd and the Hot Club of Hulaville will keep the good times rolling.</p>

<p>During the month of September, make a donation at Foodland or Sack-n-Save and they will match a portion of your donation to Girl Fest Hawaii. No donation is too small.</p>

<p>At checkout, present your Maikai Card and inform the cashier that you would like to make a donation to Girl Fest. If you do not have a Maikai Card, you may request one. Girl Fest&#8217;s five digit registration code is 78562. Your donation will be added to your grocery purchase total. You may give up to $249 per organization (donations exceeding $249 will not be matched).</p>

<p>Girl Fest&#8217;s mission is to change peer culture in order to prevent increasing violence against women and girls through education, entertainment, and positive representation of women. According to the Domestic Violence Action Center, one out of every two girls under the age of eighteen in Hawaii either has been or knows of another girl who has been physically abused. One out of five has been sexually assaulted. These girls more often than not do not seek help or call hotlines or tell their parents. They ask their friends for help, friends who are not equipped to handle situations such as abuse. Girl Fest will expose young women to positive role models, encouragement, and more choices on how to avoid violent relationships and occurrences. This is an event to educate the community to prevent the rise in violence.</p>

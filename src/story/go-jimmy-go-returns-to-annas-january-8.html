<p>Go Jimmy Go returns to Anna’s on Saturday, January 8, starting off the New Year at the venue that helped launched the group onto the international ska music scene. Joining Hawaii’s kings of ska that night at Anna’s will be their heir-apparent, Black Square.</p>

<p>Black Square released their first full length record independently in 2004, and they’ve not stopped gigging and recording since. The show on Saturday the 8th brings together two of the most accomplished indie bands ever to come out of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Anna’s will be offering Red Stripe Lager on special, honoring the Jamaican ska tradition with Jamaica’s favorite beer.</p>

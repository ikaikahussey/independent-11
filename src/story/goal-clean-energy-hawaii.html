<p>To hear Hawaii&#8217;s governor tell it, the <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/09/11/19870-is-hawaii-living-up-to-the-rhetoric-on-clean-energy/">state</a> is making tremendous progress in moving toward an energy independent future. But has the administration really made good on its promises on alternative and renewable energy, as detailed in his New Day in Hawaii Plan, his state of the state addresses and his legislative packages?</p>

<p>You have heard these figures before: Hawai’i burns five <a href="http://hpr2.org/post/ocean-thermal-energy-conversion-otec-update">billion</a> dollars worth of fossil fuel each year for 85% of the state’s energy needs. But, the Blue Planet Foundation has set a goal of transitioning to 100% clean energy by 2030, more than double the state’s clean energy objective.</p>

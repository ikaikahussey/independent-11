<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Mainstream rock darlings <a href="http://www.godsmack.com/" target="_blank">Godsmack </a>will perform a Honolulu concert on Friday, September 9, at the Blaisdell Concert Hall. Gaining popularity with their radio-friendly mainstream hard rock, Godsmack has gone on to become one of the most commercially successful acts of the genre.</p>

<p>Chart success, Grammy recognition, tours with Metallica, and Hollywood connections, Godsmack gained the credibility to “go acoustic,” and they enjoyed a pared down tour of theaters around the country with a velvet curtain-Christmas lights-”isn’t this intimate” aesthetic and gentiluity that they will presumably bring to the classy Blaisdell venue.</p>

<p><i>Tickets are available at <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com" target="_blank">www.ticketmaster.com</a> and at Wal-Mart stores.</i></p>

<p><strong>Saturday, September 9 at 8:00 p.m.<br />
Blaisdell Concert Hall<br />
777 Ward Ave.</strong></p>

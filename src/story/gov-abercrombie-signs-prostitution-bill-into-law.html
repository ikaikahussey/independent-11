<p>HONOLULU&#8212;<a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=44" target="_blank">House Bill 44</a>, pertaining to prostitution and solicitation was signed into law on June 1 by Gov. Neil Abercrombie. </p>

<p>House Bill 44 makes it a misdemeanor to offer or agree to pay a fee to another person for the purpose of sexual conduct within 750 feet of a school or public park.</p>

<p>The bill, which was introduced by Rep. Karl Rhoads (District 28&#8212;Downtown, Chinatown) is now Act 74 and takes effect on July 1, 2011.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children and their parents, going to and from school or the park, should not be exposed to a gauntlet of prostitutes, pimps and johns,&#8221; Rhoads said.&nbsp; &#8220;House Bill 44 raises the penalty for johns, and subsequently helps to clear out prostitution in areas where children must travel. The Governor&#8217;s signing of this bill is a strong message that the public has a right to use public thoroughfares without being intimidated by illegal activity.&#8221; </p>

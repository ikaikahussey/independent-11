<p>“For future years, the plan we put forward in February still stands. Our plan will add $1.3 billion to Hawaii&#8217;s economy&#8212;creating jobs and building critical infrastructure like schools, clean energy projects, and public facilities. Our plan restores critical government functions to help local businesses and invest in education. The plan balances the budget by making changes to the tax code, labor savings, and spending cuts. </p>

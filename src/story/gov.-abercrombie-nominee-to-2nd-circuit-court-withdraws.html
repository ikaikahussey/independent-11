<p>Maui attorney Joseph Wildman has asked Governor Neil Abercrombie to withdraw his nomination for  judge of the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit serves Maui County criminal, family, and traffic concerns. In his request, Wildman cited an “unresolved situation” with his current law firm, Takitani &amp; Agaran, saying he hoped to avoid distraction to the Abercrombie administration and to his own family. The law firm specializes in personal injury cases.</p>

<p>Wildman faced confirmation for the position by the State Senate. Circuit Court judges are appointed to 10-year terms by the Governor from a list of not less than four and not more than six nominees provided by the Judicial Selection Commission. </p>

<p>“I’m sorry that Joe won’t be serving the people of Hawai&#8217;i as Judge of the Circuit Court,” Governor Abercrombie said. “There are other very qualified individuals recommended by the Judicial Selection Commission, and I will be making a selection soon.”</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Governor Neil Abercrombie today announced that more than 50 Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) have been initiated as part of his New Day Works Projects to create jobs and stimulate the economy. </p>

<p>“This is just the beginning.&nbsp; Our New Day Work Projects will directly attack unemployment by putting people to work right away and jump start business activity.&nbsp; It will provide an economic boost that will reverberate throughout the state and result in paychecks for Hawai&#8217;i families.” Governor Abercrombie said.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Governor Abercrombie has also called for $1.7 billion in CIP funds for the biennium budget for future New Day Work Projects which is moving through the Legislature.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Over the last four months, Governor Abercrombie approved the release of about $300 million for these projects.&nbsp; The various projects include modernizing the airports, repairing schools, improving hurricane shelters, building school libraries, and fixing the roads.&nbsp; Majority of these projects were identified by members of the state legislature for the benefit of their communities.</p>

<p>“We took a look at CIP projects that were appropriated by the Legislature and worked quickly to release funds to the projects that fall in line with our New Day Works Projects initiative,” said Governor Abercrombie.&nbsp;  “These are projects that ensure a broad distribution of economic and community benefits.&nbsp; We are building vital infrastructure that will advance a sustainable economy while investing in our workforce as well.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, Governor Neil Abercrombie announced the nominations of three more members to state agency boards as the executive office continues to try and fill the unexpected vacancies that opened up all at once shortly after a new financial disclosure law was allowed to pass. </p>

<p>The governor announced the interim appointments (subject to state Senate approval) of Jonathan Scheuer to the Land Use Commission (LUC), as well as Rona Fukumoto and Edwin Taira to the Board of Directors of the Hawaiʻi Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC), effective immediately.<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <br />
Scheuer was appointed to an at-large seat and is the first LUC appointee to fill vacancies left by five recent resignations on the nine-member commission.<br />
 <br />
For HHFDC, Fukumoto was appointed to the “community advocate for low-income housing affiliated with a private nonprofit” seat, and Taira to the Hawaiʻi County seat. Two vacancies remain on HHFDC, also a nine-member board.</p>

<p>“Filling vacancies on the Land Use Commission is a top priority for the administration right now so commissioners can resume decision-making,”&nbsp; the governor said in a press release yesterday. “The appointments to HHFDC were expedited to avoid interruption of its duties.”<br />

<p>The State Land Use Law was adopted in 1961, establishing a framework of land use management and regulation in which all state lands are classified into urban, rural, agricultural or conservation districts. The Legislature established the Land Use Commission to administer this statewide zoning law. The commission is responsible for preserving and protecting Hawaiʻi’s lands and encouraging those uses to which the lands are best suited.<br />

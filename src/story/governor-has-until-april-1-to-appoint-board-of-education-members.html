<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On Monday, March 14, the start of the State Senate&#8217;s 2011 Education Week, Gov. Neil Abercrombie is expected to sign into law Senate Bill 8, which establishes the appointment process for the Board of Education (BOE).</p>

<p>“Education is one of my highest priorities because I believe that the future of Hawaii is dependent on the success of our public schools,” Abercrombie said in a statement.</p>

<p>Abercrombie has until April 1 to submit his nominees for boards and commissions to the Senate for confirmation this legislative session. Those interested in serving on the BOE and other boards are encouraged to apply through the Governor&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.hawaii.gov/gov" target="_blank">www.hawaii.gov/gov</a>.</p>

<p>“We welcome every person interested in serving on the Board of Education to apply,” Abercrombie said. “We need people who are committed to Hawaii’s students and who can help bring change to public education in Hawaii.”</p>

<p>The board will consist of nine members&#8212;three from Oahu, three at large, and one each from Hawaii Island, Maui, and Kauai. The Governor will also select the chairperson.</p>

<p>One of the nine appointees will be First Hawaiian Bank Chief Executive Officer Don Horner, who currently serves on the board. On February 9, Abercrombie appointed Horner to fill a vacancy on the BOE with the intention of Horner to serve on the BOE long term. </p>

<p>BOE members oversee the Department of Education (DOE), which has a $1.7 billion operational budget. The DOE is one of the State’s largest organizations with more employees than the State’s five largest private sector employers combined.</p>

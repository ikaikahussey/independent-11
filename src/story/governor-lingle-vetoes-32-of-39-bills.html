<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On the final day possible, Gov. Linda Lingle vetoed 32 of 39 bills that were placed on her potential veto list. </p>

<p>The governor attributed the vetoes to &#8220;significant negative impacts on the public, legal or constitutional concerns, potential unintended consequences, or technical flaws in the legislation.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of the 39 bills on the governorâ€™s potential veto list, three bills had been vetoed earlier: <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=2001" title="SB2001">SB2001</a> relating to technology investment tax credits; <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=1907" title="HB1907">HB1907</a>, which the governor said would have raised taxes over $140 million over five years and discouraged charitable donations; and <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=415" title="HB415">HB415</a>, which called for an audit of the Department of Public Safety.</p>

<p>Lingle signed into law <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=1015" title="HB1015">HB1015</a> (Act 187), which affirms that the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands may initiate housing and other projects prior to having the full funds for the project available and allows the Department to extend existing commercial land leases for up to an additional 20 years.</p>

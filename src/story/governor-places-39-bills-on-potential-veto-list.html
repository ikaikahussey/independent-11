<p>HONOLULU – Governor Linda Lingle today submitted to the State Legislature a list of 39 bills that she is considering for potential vetoes.</p>

<p>This year the Legislature passed 250 bills. As of today, 167 bills have become law. Four other measures have been vetoed. For a complete list of bills that have become law this legislative session or to read the Governor’s statements of objections on bills already vetoed, visit <a href="http://www.hawaii.gov/gov/leg/2010-legislative-session" title="www.hawaii.gov/gov/leg/2010-legislative-session">www.hawaii.gov/gov/leg/2010-legislative-session</a> or visit <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/RptVetoIntent.aspx" title="capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/RptVetoIntent.aspx">capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/RptVetoIntent.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>The Governor is required by the Hawaii Constitution to give the Legislature 10 days notice of any bill she is considering vetoing, prior to the deadline when she must take final action on the bills passed in the 2010 legislative session. This year the deadline to veto bills is July 6.</p>

<p>Any bill on the potential veto list can still be signed by the Governor or allowed to become law without her signature. Placing the bills on the potential veto list allows the Governor additional time to deliberate, and provides further opportunities for the public to voice their support or concern relating to the bills. Bills not on the potential veto list cannot be vetoed.</p>

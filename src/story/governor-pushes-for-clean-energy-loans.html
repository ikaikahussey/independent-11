<p>In his <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/governor-abercrombies-2013-state-of-the-state-address">State of the State address</a>, Governor Abercrombie described an idea which was mentioned at the Ideas Summit: on-bill financing. The Governor said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By utilizing moneys deposited in a special fund to provide capitalization, we will provide a periodic payment system that can be assessed through a customerâ€™s electric utility bill that will amortize the costs of the system over a sustained period, allowing more of us to take advantage of renewable energy in our homes, our businesses, our churches and our communities.&nbsp; No longer will a photovoltaic system be only available to those who can afford the significant initial investment. Instead, this program will allow users to take advantage now, and pay for it over the long run while deriving the immediate benefits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good idea.</p>

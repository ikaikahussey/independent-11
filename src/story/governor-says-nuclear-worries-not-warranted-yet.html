<p>HONOLULU&#8212;As U.S. officials collect data from planes over the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, Gov. Neil Abercrombie today attempted to quell fears of radiation arriving in Hawaii.</p>

<p>The latest data shows that the worst contamination has not spread beyond the 19-mile range of highest concern established by Japanese authorities, <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/world/asia/18intel.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></i> reported today. American officials said their biggest worry was that the latest efforts by the Japanese military to cool the nuclear fuel in the reactors showed few signs of working.</p>

<p>Here at home, Abercrombie echoed comments made by President Barack Obama that no harmful levels of radiation are expected to reach Hawaii.</p>

<p>“I want to reassure residents and visitors that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the highest authority on radiation in the nation, has indicated Japan’s nuclear emergency presents no danger to Hawaii,&#8221; Abercrombie said in a statement. &#8220;Our State and County monitoring systems have not detected any increase in radiation levels, and based on all available information, State and federal experts do not anticipate any risk of harmful radiation exposure to our islands. We are open for business. Hawaii continues to be the world’s paradise.</p>

<p>“Residents do not need to take protective measures at this time. Our state Department of Health is working closely with State, County and federal agencies to monitor the situation on a minute-to-minute basis. Ongoing updates and informational sessions are taking place with federal authorities.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, we continue to send our aloha to the people of Japan. As one island people to another, we stand with them in solidarity and in sympathy for the challenges they are facing.”</p>

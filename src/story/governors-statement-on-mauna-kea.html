<p>UPDATE: the governor&#8217;s office released a statement later in the day confirming that 11 were arrested, not 10.</p>

<p>Governor Ige is on the mainland for a conference about renewable energy. While he is away, 10 citizens of Hawaii were arrested on Mauna Kea today for physically impeding construction crews for the controversial Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) project, which has resumed with the blessing of the state. One of those arrested was Ku Kiai Mauna movement leader Kahookahi Kanuha. On behalf of the governor, Chief of Staff Mike McCartney released the following statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>Statement on TMT </p>

<p>By Chief of Staff Mike McCartney on behalf of Governor David Ige <br />
 <br />
It is our belief that there will be mutual respect and aloha on Wednesday and in the days ahead as TMT restarts construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope.</p>

<p>TMT has the approvals needed to proceed with construction. We respect those who oppose the project and their right to peaceably assemble and to protest in an orderly and civil manner.</p>

<p>The State of Hawai‘i’s primary concern is the health and safety of its people. The state and Hawai‘i County are working together to uphold the law and ensure safety on roadways and on Mauna Kea, while allowing the people their right to peacefully and lawfully protest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were at least 500 people who gathered on the mountain today to prevent construction crews from continuing work on the TMT. Mileka Lincoln of Hawaii News Now reports that the crews only made it about 1.5 miles up the mountain. Here is a video she posted of the DLNR officer tearfully apologizing to the protesters and informing them that the officers would be turning around. </p>

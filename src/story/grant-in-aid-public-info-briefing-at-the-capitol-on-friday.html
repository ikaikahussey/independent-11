<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Senate Committee on Ways and Means and the House Committee on Finance will conduct a joint informational briefing on all grants-in-aid applications to the 2011 Legislature on Friday, April 15 at 10:00 a.m. in the State Capitol Auditorium. </p>

<p>The briefing will include applicants from Neighbor Islands and Oahu. Applicants are not required to attend the joint briefing, and all grant-in-aid applications will be duly considered regardless of whether the applicants attend the briefings. Any non-government entity can apply for a grant-in-aid.</p>

<p>2. Each representative will be allowed no more than three minutes to provide any additional information.</p>

<p>The Green Bay Packers took the Super Bowl tonight, edging past the Steelers for a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?url=http://www.nfl.com/&amp;rct=j&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SLlPTfHFLZKasAPPruiXCg&amp;ved=0CDMQ4wEwAA&amp;q=superbowl&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQx9VdjLVtMRlyEU2orOrmBPpEUg">31-25 victory</a>. The Independent live-tweeted the bowl, thanks to intern <a href="http://twitter.com/markcarpenterHI">Mark Carpenter</a>.

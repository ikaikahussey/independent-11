<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;The tide brought in a crowd as colorful as the surf-inspired artwork on display at the grand opening of Green Room in Waikiki last Friday night. Green Room aims to set itself apart from other art galleries by working intimately with burgeoning local artists and designers, providing a platform for them to showcase and hone their talents.</p>

<p>Located just across the street from the Moana Surfrider, it&#8217;s an easy walk from Kapiolani Park.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To celebrate their official opening on April 16, Green Room held a party open to the public, complete with pupus, beer, music, and artist signings. Co-owner Jun Yoshimura said he was &#8220;up all night&#8221; preparing for the event. Yoshimura was also one of the performers, as part of local indie-rock band LINUS. The decision to bring Green Room to Honolulu was a fast one, and the concept came together over a few short months. This fact, however, would not be apparent to anyone visiting the gallery boutique. The small space is bright and welcoming, presenting art of various media by a courteous staff. </p>

<p>Specifically, Green Room is an international establishment committed to the celebration of Hawaiian surf culture and lifestyle through collaborations with artists and a series of community-centered cultural events. Established in Japan in 2005, Green Room has gained considerable momentum since its humble beginnings as a small group of enthusiasts looking to share their love of surf. In three short years, it has flourished into a thriving organization that, in addition to its galleries and boutiques, now hosts Asia&#8217;s largest surf culture festival&#8212;attracting 40,000 people to Tokyo annually.</p>

<p>Likewise, the attendees of the opening were a healthy mix of locals and tourists, Japanese and European, surfers and spectators, all taking in the sensory spectacle that characterizes this genre of art. Bright colors, clean lines, and a generally cheerful sensibility unified the different artists&#8217; points of view. Despite its uplifting appearances, the artwork still feels genuine, successfully capturing the mood of our surf culture while simultaneously appealing to those outside of it.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Local photographer Clark Little was on hand to sign his photographs&#8212;his images of the ocean are intense and routinely jaw-dropping. Heather Brown, whose paintings and silkscreens could be described as Japanese-woodblock-meets-1960s-Music-Festival-poster, was supposed to attend the signing as well, but unfortunately could not make it due to illness. She has made a big name of herself both locally and internationally these last few years with high-profile commissions, including the visual branding of Jack Johnson&#8217;s popular Kokua Festival. Sho Watanabe, a multi-media artist who traveled from Japan for the opening, showed several pieces displaying a strong graphic style. It should be noted that all of these artists are surfers themselves.</p>

<p>Green Room will continually spotlight surf-inspired artists, musicians, and designers as well as a rotating showcase of surf inspired artwork.</p>

<p>The gallery boutique will also carry an exclusive T-shirt line created in collaboration with local artists and creators, as well as swimwear by Pualani. Green Room&#8217;s expansion to Hawaii, the birthplace of surf, looks to be a welcome addition to the Waikiki art scene and a possible new favorite for locals looking for art that captures their ocean life style at an affordable price point.</p>

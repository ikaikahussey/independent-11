<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The H-POWER Expansion Project, which is adding a third boiler and other improvements to the City-owned waste-to-energy facility, has reached its halfway point, on schedule and on budget.&nbsp; The 20-year old facility currently generates sufficient electrical energy to power 50,000 homes.</p>

<p>Several aspects of the expansion are near completion, including concrete work and steel support work for the boiler and generator. Electrical work has begun. The City says that improvements at H-POWER will ensure reliable performance for the next 20 years. With curbside recycling now island-wide, it is projected that the plant will allow 90 percent of Oahuâ€™s municipal solid waste to be diverted from the landfill.<br />

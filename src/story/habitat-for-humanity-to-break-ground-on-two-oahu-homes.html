<p>HONOLULU&#8212;<a href="http://honoluluhabitat.org" target="_blank">Honolulu Habitat for Humanity</a> (HHH) will hold two groundbreaking ceremonies in the coming days welcoming the Lehua Fuller family of Waimanalo into the HHH program at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, July 9 and the Naone-Bailey family of Papakolea on Tuesday, July 12 at 9:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Honolulu Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit organization that partners with low-income families on Oahu to build simple, decent homes they can afford to buy. Since its inception in 1988, HHH has built over 65 homes on Oahu and given more than 350 people the opportunity to own their own home.</p>

<p>Honolulu Habitat for Humanity serves the needs of O‘ahu families of the lowest income and most need, those who earn 30 percent to 60 percent of the area median income. Families are required to contribute at least 500 hours of “sweat equity,&#8221; in which they participate in the construction of their own home, as well as other partner family’s homes.</p>

<p>The Fuller ceremony will be held at 41-124 Nalu St. in Waimanalo and will include an introduction of Lehua Fuller. The Naone-Bailey ceremony will be held at 580 Auwaiolimu Street in Papākolea. Both ceremonies will include a special message from HHH Executive Director Genie Brown, and a blessing of the home site.</p>

<p>Living in Waimanalo, Lehua had seen friends and neighbors work with HHH for their homes, and was inspired to attend a family information session at the Waimanalo Library. Lehua and her husband, who passed away in 1994, had raised their 12 children in their 4 bedroom home, and it was in serious need of repair. Lehua completed her required sweat equity working in the HHH office and assisting with special events.&nbsp;   </p>

<p>After seeing a family member’s Habitat home, the Gallardes in Waimanalo, Wallace Naone-Bailey and his son Michael applied together for their Habitat home. The home had been built in 1962, and Wallace, Fran, and their children moved into the home after her father transferred the lease. The home as it stands now is termite eaten and falling apart, and the family is looking forward to a safe, simple, decent Habitat home.&nbsp; The family completed their sweat equity by working on the Vasconcellos home in Waimanalo and working in the Honolulu Habitat office.</p>

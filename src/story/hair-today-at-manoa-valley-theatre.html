<p>Hair, the Tony Award-winning tribal rock musical that defined the &#8220;Age of Aquarius,&#8221; is onstage at Manoa Valley from March 4 to April 4.</p>

<p>The story of a group of young Americans searching for love and peace during the Vietnam era, Hair is a timeless portrait of a movement that changed the world. The 1968 Broadway hit blazed a new trail in musical theatre by defining the genre of the &#8220;rock musical.&#8221; Its groundbreaking rock score features some of the greatest songs ever written for the stage, several becoming Top 40 hits and anthems of the anti-war movement. The show was revived on Broadway to acclaim in 2009 as the Age of Aquarius dawns again in this jubilant new production&#8212;a celebration of life, a love letter to freedom, and a passionate cry for hope and change.</p>

<p>Songs include &#8220;Aquarius,&#8221; &#8220;Let the Sun Shine In,&#8221; &#8220;Be-In (Hare Krishna),&#8221; &#8220;Good Morning Starshine,&#8221; &#8220;Hair,&#8221; and more.</p>

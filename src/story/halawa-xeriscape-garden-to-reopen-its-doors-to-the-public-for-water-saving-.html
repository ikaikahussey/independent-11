<p>HALAWA&#8212;The Board of Water Supply’s (BWS) Halawa Xeriscape Garden, located at  99-1268 Iwaena Street Halawa Valley’s Central Park industrial area, will soon reopen to the general public.</p>

<p>Beginning Saturday, November 6 the community may once again enjoy self-guided tours, free garden mulch and water conservation workshops for adults and keiki. The garden’s regular open hours are Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The Halawa Xeriscape Garden is a three-acre demonstration garden that displays a series of unthirsty, water-conserving plants in a visually attractive garden. BWS opened the garden to the public in September 1989 as a way to educate Oahu residents on ways to save water outdoor in lawns, gardens, and landscaped areas.</p>

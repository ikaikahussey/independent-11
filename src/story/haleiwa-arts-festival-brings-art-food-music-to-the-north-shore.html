<p>HALEIWA&#8212;The <a href="http://www.haleiwaartsfestival.org/index.shtml" target="_blank">Haleiwa Arts Festival</a> returns to the North Shore this weekend, once again offering an abundance of arts and crafts, food, and entertainment. All of it embodies the wonderful diversity of talent and vision inherent in Oahuâ€™s arts community.</p>

<p>Celtic Pipes and Drums will start the festival with the stirring, marshal sounds of bagpipes and marching drums. Performances throughout the event will include bluegrass music, opera, ukulele, rockabilly, and a musical theater performance by the Castle High School Performing Arts Center.</p>

<p>The Haleiwa Arts Festival will feature the work of approximately 140 artists. All were selected by jury and include artists working in a wide variety of media. A host of local food vendors will be on hand, offering a cornucopia of local and ethnic foods. </p>

<p>Several North Shore merchants, vendors, and galleries will offer special promotions on the festival grounds throughout the weekend event.</p>

<p>The Haleiwa Arts Festival began in 1998, dedicated to education and the promotion of public awareness about the arts in Hawaii. The festival conducts workshops, demonstrations, and classroom education on Oahu year-round. </p>

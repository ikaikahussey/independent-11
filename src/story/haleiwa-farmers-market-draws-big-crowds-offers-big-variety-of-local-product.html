<p>The North Shore welcomed the last month of summer with a very busy Sunday at the Haleiwa Farmers Market. Every Sunday, rain or shine, the outdoor market that sells only locally made or produced products and produce draws throngs of visitors who come to enjoy the ono grinds and stock up on veggies, jewelry, and even get their scissors sharpened. </p>

<p>Market manager Pamela Boyar said on Sunday, &#8220;We&#8217;ve get around 2,000 to 2,500 visitors each Sunday. It&#8217;s really grown.&#8221; </p>

<p>Local visitors can see that market goers come from around the island, and even tourists catch word of the locally driven market and make the drive out to the North Shore to attend. Produce, chickens, organic meats, live music, jewelry, kettle corn popped at the market, freshly pounded poi, and even a jumping castle at the keiki corner are just a few of the different things shoppers can purchase or view. The zero waste market that requires shoppers to bring their own shopping bags operates Sundays from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.</p>

<p>As the approaching weekend marks the halfway point to the 2011 Saint Patrick’s Day, the Friends of Saint Patrick Celtic society and Murphy’s Bar and Grill are offering a variety of events to mark the occasion. Murphy’s hosts a block party at Nuuanu Avenue and Merchant Street at 6:00 p.m., featuring the Celtic rock of Doolin Rakes. Part of the proceeds from the sale of each Guinness and Smithwick’s Irish Ale will benefit Celtic Pipes and Drums of Hawaii.</p>

<p>A pub crawl will begin at Anna’s at 6:00 p.m., moving to Kelly O’Neil’s, the Irish Rose Saloon, O’Toole’s Irish Pub, and finish at the Murphy’s block Party. An annual Irish toast contest will begin at O’Toole’s at 7:00 p.m. The grand prize is a trip for two to Las Vegas. Musician Murray Thorne of Maui’s Celtic Tigers will begin at 8:00 p.m., followed by Doolin Rakes at 10:00 p.m.<br />
&nbsp;  <br />
The Friends of Saint Patrick will hold a whiskey tasting on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. at O’Toole’s, featuring a fine selection of Scotch and Irish whiskeys. Pupus will be served, and the tasting will be followed by a performance by Doolin Rakes. The cost for nonmembers is $45 and $15 for paid members.&nbsp; </p>

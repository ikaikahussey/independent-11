<p>The Hallowbaloo Music Showcase street festival on Friday, June 17 will serve two noble purposes: presenting the talents of some of Honolulu’s most notable songwriters, and raising money for <a href="http://hawaiiartsalliance.org/" target="_blank">The Arts at Mark’s Garage</a>. Part of Slow Art Friday, the event will feature food from Otto Cakes on the street, beer, wine and cocktails, with crafts on display and for sale.</p>

<p>Scheduled to perform at the Hallowbaloo Music Showcase are Mike Love, Sing the Body, and The Hollow Spheres, all of whom have drawn fans with their unique approached to the art of writing songs. The performances will take place in the theater inside Mark’s, and also will be broadcast onto Pauahi Street.</p>

<p>In addition to the music, <a href="http://www.cherryblossomcabaret.com/" target="_blank">Cherry Blossom Cabaret </a>will perform Femme Capulet at 7:00 p.m., directed by Troy Apostol. A community kiln will also be on hand, and attendees can purchase teacups and glaze and fire their own pieces.</p>

HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;A Hawaii County Board of Ethics meeting was held on July 14 at the Hilo Lagoon Center to discuss the status of approximately 737 acres of Hamakua land currently up for sale by the County. A complaint was brought by Shelley Stephens of Mountain View. Present at the meeting were three members of the ethics board: Chairperson John Dill, Vice Chairperson Anne Lum, and Arne Henricks.</p>

<p>Stephens is associated with a group called Na Ohana O Moku O Keawe that claims the sale of the land is unethical. She brought the complaint against Mayor Billy Kenoi and the Hawaii County Council.</p>

<p>Throughout the hearing, Stephens stated that the County had no right to sell the land because it legally belongs to descendents of King Kamehameha III, among them Albert Haa Jr., who was present at the meeting. </p>

<p>Stephens argued that not enough had been done by the County to find the true heirs of the Hamakua land.</p>

<p>Haa told <i>Youth News for The Hawaii Independent</i> that King Kamehameha III faked his death then moved to Canada. He further stated that descendents of Kamehameha changed their names numerous times making the genealogy hard to trace.</p>

<p>Also present and active in the discussion were William J.M. Kuamoo and Gene Tamashiro. Tamashiro, the executive producer of Uamau Productions and a political activist, became part of a heated exchange with Lum. </p>

<p>As members of the board insisted it was not their job to settle land disputes, Stephens asked the chairman to write a letter referring to what she claimed were clouded land titles. Again the board members refused. The only result of the complaint and hearing was a vote to accept Stephens’ petition without action due to lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of the County during a phone interview the following day, the mayor&#8217;s spokesperson, Hunter Bishop, said Stephens’ claims are untrue. </p>

<p>“We believe we have clear title to the property,” Bishop said.</p>

<p>The mayor’s office also stated: &#8220;People of the Big Island will continue to protest land sold by the government for profit.&#8221;</p>

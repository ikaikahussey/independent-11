<p>Congresswoman Hanabusa&#8217;s office <a href="http://hanabusa.house.gov/press-release/statement-current-situation-syria">released</a> the following statement on Monday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I condemn the use of chemical weapons and look forward to a safe and thorough United Nations investigation at the site of the alleged attacks, along with a full report to the international community. The world has a moral obligation to pursue an appropriate response to any use of these inhumane and illegal weapons. There is no place in any conflict for chemical warfare.</p>

<p>However, the United States must remain cautious and pragmatic in our response.&nbsp; Faulty intelligence on WMDs drew us into a bloody struggle in Iraq. The last decade of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrated what comes of war waged with poor planning. We cannot haphazardly enter another conflict with a sovereign nation. Questions still remain about the identity and intentions of the Syrian opposition to the Assad regime, and I believe we need clear answers before moving forward.&nbsp; It is my hope that President Obama will consult with Congress and other key stakeholders before taking action in Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

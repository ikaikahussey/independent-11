<p>Originally published on Derrick DePledge&#8217;s <em>Political Radar</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa on Friday will debut her first television advertisement in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate, a spot that stresses her roots growing up on the Leeward coast.</p>

<p>The ad shows the congresswoman driving past her family&#8217;s service station in Waianae and shopping at a local grocery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very fortunate to be born and raised in Waianae,&#8221; she says in the ad. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have many privileges. But I learned from my parents, family and neighbors the values of Hawaii. How to work hard, and do your best with every opportunity you have. And I know with every opportunity comes obligation, to help others, to give back, to represent Hawaii well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hanabusa is challenging U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz in the primary.</p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>

<p>Hawaii - Richard Rapoza – (808) 392-0780</p>

<p>HANABUSA WILL OPPOSE “FAST TRACK” TRADE LEGISLATION</p>

<p>Washington, D.C. – U.S. Representative Colleen Hanabusa (HI-01) today said that she intends to vote against the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014, which would provide only limited, expedited procedures under which Congress could consider trade agreements.</p>

<p>“During my time in Congress, I have consistently advocated for better engagement with rest of the world and maintained that negotiating fair trade agreements with our international partners is essential in the 21st Century,” Hanabusa said.&nbsp; “However, I cannot support a measure that severely curtails Congressional review and amendment of proposed agreements, and would only allow for up or down votes for as long as the next seven years.</p>

<p>“Trade deals impact more than just the exports they increase. They can affect American jobs, public health, workers’ rights, and our natural environment including the global climate.&nbsp; Any negotiation of this magnitude must give Congress, the representatives of the people, a significant voice in crafting agreements that affect so many lives.&nbsp; The scope of these agreements and the change that comes with increased globalization make thorough and meaningful consideration essential.</p>

<p>“I look forward to reviewing further efforts to construct a responsible trade agenda, and will carefully review any prospects of increasing trade and investment in the State of Hawaii.”</p>

<p>The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014 was introduced Thursday by Representative Dave Camp, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.&nbsp; Under the bill, Congress would receive trade agreements for a straight up-or-down vote, with limited debate and no opportunity for amendments.</p>

<p>Ranking Member Sander Levin declined to endorse the bill and said that he has started working on an alternative version of a trade negotiating authority bill.</p>

<p>In November 2013, Hanabusa, along with 150 other Members of Congress, sent a letter to President Obama opposing use of outdated “Fast Track” procedures.</p>

<p>Five companies submitted bids this week to build the three rail stations in the Farrington Highway Station Group, which consists of the West Loch Station, the Waipahu Transit Center Station and the station at Leeward Community College.<br />
 <br />
Hawaiian Dredging Company&#8217;s bid was $78,999,000.&nbsp; Nan, Inc. submitted a bid of $85,074,478.&nbsp; Hensel Phelps&#8217; bid was $88,016,525.&nbsp; Watts Constructors&#8217; submitted a bid of $88,803,553, and Ralph S. Inouye Company&#8217;s bid was $117,515,520. <br />
 <br />
&#8220;While we are about where we thought we would be, these costs confirm what we&#8217;ve been saying the past few months, and that is we are in an aggressive construction market,&#8221; said HART Executive Director and CEO Dan Grabauskas.&nbsp; &#8220;Industry experts forecast those costs will rise even higher in the future, so waiting is not an option.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
HART staff will now carefully examine all of the bids submitted this week to ensure that the bidders were both responsive and responsible.<br />
 <br />
HART plans to request bids for the next set of three west side stations next month.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;<a href="http://www.diamondbakery.com" title="Diamond Bakery">Diamond Bakery</a> announced the results of their statewide campaign, “Have a Heart, Save a Heart 2010”.</p>

<p>From sales of Diamond Bakery’s hearty crackers, the company is donating:</p>

<p>* $5,000 to American Heart Association&#8212;Hawaii Chapter, “Heart Walk”</p>

<p>* An automated external defibrillator to Manana Elementary School at 1147 Kumano Street, Pearl City, valued at $2,500</p>

<p>“We are grateful to the people of Hawaii for purchasing our heart-healthy crackers during  the promotion,” said Brent Kunimoto, president of Diamond Bakery. “They did something good for themselves by eating healthy snacks but, more importantly, their purchase helped us raise funds for the American Heart Association.”</p>

<p>A third component of the promotion involves providing CPR lessons, with fire fighters from Pearl City Fire Station (Engine #20) instructing the Manana Elementary School teachers and staff.</p>

<p>This is the third year Diamond Bakery has partnered with the American Heart Association to promote healthy hearts with the “Have a Heart, Save a Heart” campaign. Diamond Bakery donates profits from the sales of its heart healthy cracker during January, February (Heart Month), and March to the American Hearth Association&#8217;s Hawaii chapter for education, research, and the purchase of automated external defibrillators.</p>

<p>Diamond Bakery was founded in 1921 by Japanese immigrant families and has been making crackers and cookies for nearly 90 years.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii Book and Music festival returns to the Frank F. Fasi Civic Grounds in Honolulu, again with a staggering amount of authors, musicians, storytellers, and speakers, all in “celebration of story and song.”</p>

<p>The two-day family event will feature dozens of local, national, and international authors speaking about their craft in a variety of talk-story sessions in the Authors Pavillion. Keiki will have the chance to meet their favorite characters in person, including Clifford the Big Red Dog, Maya and Miguel, Curious George, and the Cat in the Hat.</p>

<p>Some of Hawaii’s most revered musicians and groups will perform over two days&#8212;Cyril Pahinui, Pierre Grill &amp; Genai, and the Royal Hawaiian Band among them. The improvised comedy rock duo Oil in the Alley performs Saturday afternoon. Willow Chang World Dance will perform on Saturday, after a speech by Mayor Peter Carlisle.</p>

<p>Choirs from Mid Pacific Institute, La Pietra, and Kapiolani Community College will perform at the Mission Memorial Auditorium. Comedienne, actress, and now Big Island resident Roseanne Barr will perform <i>Roseannearchy: Dispatches from the Nut Farm</i>. </p>

<p>In addition to the literary focus of the Hawaii Book and Music Festival, it will also feature many forums on the most important issues Hawaii faces today: economics, Native Hawaiian sovereignty (moderated by former Governor John D. Waihee), energy, transportation, and sustainable communities. Hawaii’s leading authorities on these issues will participate.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Charter School Governance, Accountability, and Authority Task Force (CSGTF) held its first meeting today. The Task Force was established by Senate Bill 1174, now known as Act 130, which laid the groundwork for a reorganization of Hawaii&#8217;s charter schools.</p>

<p>The Task Force is co-chaired by Senate Education Committee Chair Jill Tokuda and House Education Committee Vice-Chair Della Au Belatti. </p>

<p>Representatives from the Legislature, Governor’s office, Board of Education, Department of Education, Charter School Administrative Office, Charter School Review Panel, Charter School Network, Hookakoo Corporation, and Kamehameha Schools are expected to participate on the task force as set forth in Act 130.</p>

<p>“Today’s meeting was a good start to a great opportunity to ensure that our charter school system has a high level of accountability, clear lines of authority and a strong governance structure that will result in even better schools,” Tookuda said.</p>

<p>The Task Force four more scheduled meetings, and it will make recommendations to the Legislature before next year&#8217;s session.</p>

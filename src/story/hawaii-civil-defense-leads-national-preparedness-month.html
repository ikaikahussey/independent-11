<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The State is using September, National Preparedness Month, as an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of preparing homes and communities for emergencies in America.</p>

<p>In recent years, advances in how we predict and track hurricanes have improved preparedness and saved lives, but residents and businesses must still be prepared. </p>

<p>By taking simple steps such as creating a disaster supply kit, making a personal or family disaster plan, and staying informed about different threats greatly improves chances for survival and recovery. These activities create a culture of consciousness and can help save lives.</p>

<p>Throughout Preparedness Month, the Hawaii State Civil Defense (SCD) is organizing events to encourage residents to get involved in community preparedness efforts.</p>

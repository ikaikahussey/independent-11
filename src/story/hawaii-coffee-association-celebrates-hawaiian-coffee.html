<p>KEALAKEKUA, Hawaii&#8212;The Hawaii Coffee Association (HCA) will celebrate Hawaiian coffee and educate members, farmers, and industry professionals at its 15th annual conference from July 15 to 17 at the Sheraton Keauhou Bay Resort &amp; Spa located on Kona&#8217;s Gold Coast of Hawaii Island.</p>

<p>The event features the 2nd annual statewide cupping competition wherein premium coffees collected from all of Hawaii&#8217;s diverse origins vie for the honor of being placed among the finest coffees produced in the U.S., and the world. Entries will be blind judged by an independent panel of expert coffee &#8220;cuppers&#8221; with honors awarded in the &#8220;Best of Origin&#8221; and &#8220;Best of Hawaii&#8221; categories.</p>

<p>In addition to the annual statewide cupping competition and consistent with the HCA&#8217;s technical cupping theme, this year&#8217;s conference will feature a hands-on coffee cupping workshop designed to educate members and visitors about coffee cupping: the elements of nuance that include flavor, aroma, &#8220;mouth-feel,&#8221; acidity, sweetness, and aftertaste. Knowledge about how to properly sample and score coffee has become increasingly important to farmers, processors, roasters, wholesalers, and retailers in an ever more competitive international marketplace.</p>

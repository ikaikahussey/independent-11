<p>HONOLULU&#8212;During the last week of July, the State of Hawaii observes Conservation Week in recognition of the need to take care of Hawaii&#8217;s unique natural environment. </p>

<p>Next week marks Hawaii&#8217;s fifth annual Conservation Week, coordinated by the <a href="http://hawaiiconservation.org/activities/hawaii_conservation_conference/conservation_week" target="_blank">Hawaii Conservation Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>Events throughout the week aim to increase public awareness of key conservation issues affecting Hawaii&#8217;s lands and seas and unite the islands&#8217; leadership in identifying conservation-related priorities of statewide significance.</p>

<p>“Hawaii is blessed with a magnificent natural environment and abundant resources,&#8221; said T. ‘Aulani Wilhelm, chair of the Hawaii Conservation Alliance. &#8220;Living amid such beauty is a constant reminder of the role we play as stewards of the land and sea, responsible for ensuring that these resources will be enjoyed for many generations to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>This year’s Conservation Week kicks off on Sunday July 24 with a free family fishing day at <a href="http://www1.honolulu.gov/parks/hbg/hmbg.htm" target="_blank">Hoomaluhia Botanical Garden</a> in Kaneohe. </p>

<p>· An art exhibit opening reception showcasing Maui-based painter and park ranger Melissa Chimera’s <i>Splendor: Portraits of the Natural World</i> and Honolulu-based nature writer and poet Adele Ne Jame, who will read poems inspired by the remote Hawaiian wilderness from her new book <i>The South Wind</i>.

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Last week, Gov. Neil Abercrombie signed an executive order that establishes the Hawaii Interagency Council on Homelessness (HICH). The 24-member council&#8212;composed of State department directors, federal agency representatives, and community leaders&#8212;is tasked with developing a unified plan on addressing homelessness.</p>

<p>The creation of the Council was first announced in May by the Governor and Marc Alexander, the Governor’s Coordinator on Homelessness, as an important part of the State’s 90-Day Plan on Homelessness. The first meeting of the Council is tentatively scheduled for early August.</p>

<p>“The Hawaii Interagency Council on Homelessness will be action oriented, results based, and maintain a relentless focus on bringing about results,” Abercrombie said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Council will meet quarterly and report annually to the Governor, the Legislature and county mayors, including policy recommendations supporting the statewide plan.</p>

<p>“Bringing cabinet-level leadership together with federal agencies and the private sector will force everyone to elevate their focus on this issue,” Alexander said. “Many people have been working diligently to address homelessness, but the establishment of this council will increase coordination and help take these efforts to the next level.”</p>

<p>The Council will align its efforts with the U.S. Interagency Council on Homeless (USICH), established by President Obama in 2009. </p>

<p><b>Key mandates for the Council include:</b></p>

<p>* Increasing transitional and permanent housing options.</p>

<p>* Acquiring increased federal funding to support homeless efforts.</p>

<p>* Replicating successful initiatives implemented in other states.</p>

<p>* Increasing the integration of social, health, training, and housing services to reduce duplication among homeless assistance programs.</p>

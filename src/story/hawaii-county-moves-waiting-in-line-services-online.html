<p>HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;The County of Hawaii launched an online motor vehicle registration renewal service through the State&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.eHawaii.gov" title="http://www.eHawaii.gov">http://www.eHawaii.gov</a>. The service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Hawaii County motor vehicle owners, we&#8217;ve essentially taken a &#8216;waiting in line&#8217; service online,&#8221; said Lee Lord, Hawaii Vehicle Licensing and Registration Division Manager.</p>

<p>Citizens can access the online system by providing the last four digits of their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and their license plate number. Users are then guided through the entire payment process.</p>

<p>Motorists who choose to use the online service will be charged a convenience fee of $2.50, plus 2.25 percent of the registration cost. The fee may be paid via credit card, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover. Upon confirmation of payment, a receipt is emailed and may be printed for recordkeeping. The new registration certificate and emblem will be mailed to the customer via the U.S. Postal Service.</p>

<p>The system is maintained on secure servers and uses the latest encryption technology to ensure privacy, security, and data integrity, Lord said.</p>

<p>The motor vehicle registration renewal system is the most recent addition to the county&#8217;s online services.

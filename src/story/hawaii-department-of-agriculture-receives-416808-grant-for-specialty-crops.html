The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 U.S. Farm Bill) amended the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 and authorized the USDA to provide grants to States for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2012.</p>

<p>* Expand diversity and coverage of specialty crops and support the ongoing state marketing program.</p>

<p>* Develop a cookbook that utilizes Hawaii specialty crops as ingredients in food recipes that are healthy and contain nutritional information.</p>

<p>* Partner with University of Hawaii’s College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources to provide specialty crop farmers with on-farm food safety training, education, extension, outreach, and technical assistance with emphasis on high risk specialty crops.</p>

<p>* Partner with Kokua Hawaii Foundation’s AINA in Schools Program to provide educational materials and cafeteria procurement and preparation guides highlighting Hawaii specialty crops for use by Hawaii schools participating in the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program.</p>

<p>* Partner with Hawaii Pacific Export Council to provide information and resources to small and medium enterprises so they will have the proper tools to successfully export their specialty crops.</p>

<p>* Perform pre-award and post-award activities in order to administrate the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program funding and ensure that the State Agency and sub-awardees abide by Federal and State requirements and regulations.</p>

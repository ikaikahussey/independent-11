<p>A <a href="http://ag.hawaii.gov/cpja/files/2013/03/Firearm-Registrations-2012.pdf">2012</a> report from the Attorney General Crime Prevention and Justice Assistance Divsion shows that there&#8217;s actually a reverse correlation in Hawaii between firearms registration and gun-related violence.</p>

<p>Paul Perrone, Chief of Research &amp; Statistics, writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the tremendous increases in statewide firearm registration activity throughout the 2000-2012 period, and in particular the major increases reported for the post-2008 period, it is understandable that some readers might at first glance be alarmed, fearing that these increases have necessarily resulted in commensurate increases in firearm-related violent crime trends. However, as shown in the following figures, such has not been the case. </p>

<p>[...] While firearm registration activity has increased dramatically, the trend for firearm-related violent crimes has remained fairly stable within a narrow range, and decreased substantially during the same period (2008-2012*) during which registration activity increased the most sharply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perrone told <em>the Independent</em> that even though we have a comparatively stringent background check, including checks for mental illness, we have a relatively low denial rate. </p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the squeakiest clean of our citizens which are applying for firearms permits,&#8221; Perrone said.</p>

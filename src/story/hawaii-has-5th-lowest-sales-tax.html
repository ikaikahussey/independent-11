<p>You may be surprised by the findings of a report released by a Washington DC think tank on Thursday: Hawaii has the 5th lowest sales tax in the US.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Among states with a state-level general sales tax, the five with the lowest combined rates are Hawaii (4.35 percent), Maine (5 percent), Virginia (5 percent), South Dakota (5.22 percent), and Wyoming (5.3 percent). The five states with the highest combined state-local rates are Tennessee (9.44 percent), California (9.08 percent), Arizona (9.01 percent), Louisiana (8.69 percent) and Washington (8.64 percent).</p>

<p>The World Youth Congress was born in 1999 in Honolulu, entitled the Millennium Young People’s Congress. Since that first Congress, subsequent congresses have taken place in Morocco, Scotland, and Quebec City, Canada. Through a strong cultural program, youth-led workshops, debates, educator’s programs, and action projects, youth activists have the opportunity to share their experiences and stories and learn ways to address the needs of their community and their world.</p>

<p>HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;State Sen. Gilbert Kahele will conduct a series of public forums starting later this month to allow Hawaii Island residents to meet directly with him and discuss subjects of interest. The first meeting will be conducted at the Cooper Center on Wednesday, August 31 from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. </p>

<p>“Given the state of our economy and world affairs, I hope we will have a healthy turnout for these forums,” said Senator Kahele. “They will be an excellent chance for me to hear directly from the people about the issues and concerns they have regarding our communities, their businesses, and their families. I look forward to the opportunity to have an open and frank discussion that will better help me to address the needs of our communities.”</p>

<p>Cooper Center is located at 19-4030 Wright Rd. in the town of Volcano. The locations and dates of <br />
subsequent meetings will be announced later.</p>

<p>On January 11, Gov. Neil Abercrombie appointed Kahele as senator for Hawaii Island&#8217;s Second District, which includes Hilo, Puna, and Kau. Kahele served as Vice Chair of the Senate Agricultural Committee.</p>

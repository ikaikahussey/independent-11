<p>HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;New signs along Alii Drive&#8217;s oceanfront promenade are inspired by ancient Hawaiian voyaging canoes&#8212;a canoe paddle, canoe sail, custom Kailua Village (KV) tapa patterning, and the interlocking KV logo reminiscent of a cattle brand that acknowledges the seaside village&#8217;s ranching heritage.</p>

<p>Kamakahonu, fronting the King Kamehameha Kona Beach Hotel, is the location where King Kamehameha the Great ruled the Hawaiian Kingdom from 1812 until his death in 1819. The interpretive sign located here tells the importance of Kamakahonu, Ahuena Heiau, and the adjacent anchialine ponds. The history and cattle heritage of Kailua Pier is also revealed.</p>

<p>At Niumalu Beach, a small sandy beach in the heart of Historic Kailua Viilage, the sign describes the meaning of Niumalu Beach (literally shade of the coconut tree) and Kailua Bay that was named for the two ocean currents that run through it. Reef health, reef creatures, a seasonal surf break, and cultural context messages are integrated in this sign.</p>

<p>The historical importance of the Village&#8217;s two iconic buildings&#8212;Mokuaikaua Church and Hulihee Palace&#8212;is discussed at the sign located near Hawaii&#8217;s oldest Christian church. And on the seaside lawn of Hale Halawai, sign topics are marine life in ancient and modern times.</p>

<p>This initiative serves to strengthen the connection between humans and the natural environment and to remind everyone to respect Hawaii&#8217;s cultural treasures and natural resources. Scores of community residents, Hawaiian cultural leaders, and government officials joined with members of the Kailua Village Business Improvement District to provide input for the interpretive program.</p>

<p>The interpretive sign program is an initiative of the Kailua Village Business Improvement District, with assistance from Hawaii Tourism Authority&#8217;s natural resources grant program. The Kailua Village Business Improvement District has identified as its top master plan priority the need for wayfinding and interpretive sign systems to guide and inform people about the unique assets of Historic Kailua Village. These interpretive signs are the first phase in the developing Historic Kailua Village Trail of Knowledge.</p>

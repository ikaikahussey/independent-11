<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii Jaycees 2010 Adopt-A-School Committee has set a goal of getting 100 schools in Hawaii &#8220;adopted.&#8221; This goal must be reached before the official Adopt-A-School Day, which arrives on the lucky date of Triple 10 (October 10, 2010 or 10/10/10).</p>

<p>On Adopt-A-School Day, participating groups will come out to their respective adopted schools and put in a day’s work to serve the needs of that institution. Last year such work included career counseling and workshops; planting of flowers and trees and other landscaping projects; delivery of school supplies collected; and long overdue painting of school buildings, playgrounds, and parking lots</p>

<p>Adopt-A-School Day&#8217;s effort has taken on new meaning and relevance today as Hawaii schools have faced furlough days and budget cutbacks. The day&#8217;s purpose is to activate real, needed support for our keiki’s education, providing local schools with manpower for projects that directly benefit both teachers and students.</p>

<p>Last year, the Jaycees reached out to other organizations in the community in order to reach as many schools as possible. In 2009, the Hawaii Jaycees were joined by HawaiiUSA Federal Credit Union, various Hawaii Lions Chapters, Watanabe Floral, Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, as well as Church groups of different faiths who came out to serve our schools. The aim is to get even more partners involved this year to maximize the impact.</p>

<p>Participating groups will be given an &#8220;Official Certificate of Adoption&#8221; to both recognize their generous spirit and to cement the bond between them and their adopted school(s). By getting involved, individuals and groups serve not just today’s Hawaii, but also its bright future, which lies in the children and teens of these islands.</p>

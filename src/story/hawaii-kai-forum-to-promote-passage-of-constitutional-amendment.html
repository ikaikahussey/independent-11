<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A community forum will talk about the constitutional amendment that proposes to have the governor appoint Hawaii&#8217;s Board of Education (BOE) rather than have it elected as is now the case. The constitutional amendment will ask voters to ratify or reject this on the November 2 ballot.</p>

<p>Support for an elected board will kick off the evening by a presentation from BOE chair Garrett Toguchi followed by a presentation from &#8220;Hawaii&#8217;s Children First&#8221;&#8212;a ballot issue committee formed specifically for the promotion and passage of the constitutional amendment.</p>

<p>The office of Rep. Gene Ward, who represents Hawaii Kai to Kalama Valley, is sponsoring the forum.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to think an elected board was the only way to get reforms implemented until I realized that an elected board is part of the problem that nothing gets done in a system that has no accountability and transparency in it,&#8221; Ward said.</p>

<p>The origins of the constitutional amendment stemmed from the public&#8217;s reaction to the 17 lost school days from &#8220;Furlough Fridays,&#8221; in addition to Hawaii&#8217;s low national ranking in school systems now at the bottom as 47th out of 50 states.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hope to have a lively debate and win this initiative, though the voices of the dissenters are joined by the blank votes in their favor, because blank votes are considered the same as &#8220;no&#8221; votes in the constitutional amendment balloting,&#8221; Ward said.</p>

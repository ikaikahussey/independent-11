<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii League of Women Voters will provide voters the statements of candidates running in the September 18 primary election. The State Office of Elections formerly posted this information on its website but discontinued the service citing budgetary constraints. </p>

<p>Candidates are invited to post their statements of up to 250 words telling voters why they should be considered for election on the League of Women Voters Website. A picture of the candidate will be posted if submitted, but no other graphics. </p>

<p>Candidates should go to <a href="http://www.lwv-hawaii.com" title="www.lwv-hawaii.com">www.lwv-hawaii.com</a> and click on webmaster@lwv-hawaii.com. Only statements submitted in this way will be accepted. The League cannot process statements sent on paper because it lacks the staffing to do so. </p>

<p>Voters can access the candidate information by clicking on the &#8220;Candidates&#8212;Election 2010” on the League’s  home page at <a href="http://www.lwv-hawaii.com" title="www.lwv-hawaii.coM">www.lwv-hawaii.coM</a>.</p>

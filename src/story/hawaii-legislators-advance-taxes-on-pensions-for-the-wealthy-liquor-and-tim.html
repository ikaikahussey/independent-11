<p><a href="http://www.canadianbusiness.com/markets/market_news/article.jsp?content=D9LRQI1G3" target="_blank">Associated Press&#8217; Mark Niesse reported</a> on the passage of a wide variety of tax hikes Tuesday, which together form the outline of a plan for the State to significantly narrow its budget deficit. Combined, more than 20 revenue bills passed by the Hawaii House of Representatives would raise about $629 million over the next two years as the state faces a projected $700 million shortfall during that time.</p>

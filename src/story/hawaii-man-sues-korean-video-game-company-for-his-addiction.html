<p>A Hawaii resident is seeking $3 million in a lawsuit against a Korean video game company for not warning him that the game is addictive.</p>

<p>Craig Smallwood claims he never would have started playing NCsoft&#8217;s multi-massive online role-playing game Lineage II if he knew he would become addicted. He alleges NCsoft &#8220;acted negligently in failing to warn or instruct or adequately warn or instruct plaintiff and other players of Lineage II of its dangerous and defective characteristics, and of the safe and proper method of using the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>HONOLULU — The Hawaii-based husband and wife duo behind one of the world’s most successful blogs and podcasts devoted to the TV show <i>Lost</i> has launched a new daily pop culture show.</p>

<p>Ryan and Jen Ozawa, hosts of “The Transmission,” launched “Popspotting” on May 23, exactly one year after <i>Lost</i> left the airwaves. But instead of devoting over an hour of conversation a week to a single show, “Popspotting” serves up a bite-sized chat every weekday, and covers movies, television, music, books, and much more.</p>

<p>“Popspotting” also adds guests into the mix, with regular trivia challenges and special interviews planned.</p>

<p>“In a way we’re going back to our roots, as our very first podcast as a couple back in 2005 was to show off Jen’s pop culture prowess,” Ryan says. “After being so focused on one thing, we’re enjoying the freedom to talk about everything.”</p>

<p>Reaching over 20,000 weekly listeners at its peak, “The Transmission” earned the couple a feature in the New York Times, and interviews and mentions from media as diverse as the Wall Street Journal, NPR, and Nightline.</p>

<p>Yet Ryan and Jen took a break from podcasting in 2006 when their show, having climbed as high as #7 among all podcasts in iTunes, grew too big to handle. Wired magazine described it as a high-profile case of “podfading.”</p>

<p>“That won’t happen again&#8212;the successful part, I mean,” Ryan jokes. “Thankfully we made it back for the last two years of ‘LOST,’ and with ‘Popspotting,’ we are definitely going to be a little more loose and casual.”</p>

<p>The shift to a daily show is a big one, as “The Transmission” was known for its strictly structured, multi-segment weekly episodes that could sometimes run over 90 minutes long. And the current format&#8212;movies on Monday, TV on Tuesday, “Wildcard Wednesday,” guests and trivia on Thursday and listener feedback on Friday&#8212;is still described as an experiment.</p>

<p>“We are still getting a feel for what fits, as some listeners want more, while others want less,” Ryan says. “But as a podcast listener, I find I prefer short daily shows that I can mix and match, and am finding I sometimes never get through two-hour talkfests.”</p>

<p>Recent <em>Popspotting </em> shows have covered <em>Super 8</em>, <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, the CBS reboot of <em>Hawaii Five-0</em>, new releases from the Foo Fighters and Lady Gaga, and bestselling books from Chelsea Handler, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Suzanne Collins. In its first week, “Popspotting” climbed as high as #5 among “TV &amp; Film” audio podcasts in iTunes.</p>

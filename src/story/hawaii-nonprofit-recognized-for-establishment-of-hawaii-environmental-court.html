<p>At its annual awards ceremony Tuesday, national nonprofit Keep America Beautiful recognized The Outdoor Circle for its distinguished service in helping to pass Act 218, SLH 2014, which established Hawaii’s Environmental Court. Hawaii is only the second state in the U.S. to establish a statewide court to adjudicate environmental cases. </p>

<p>“This is a great honor and a wonderful opportunity to build stronger relationships with other environmental advocates from around the country,” said Outdoor Circle Board President, Alexandra Avery. “We are grateful to be recognized for our hard work helping to keep Hawaii clean, green and beautiful.” </p>

<p>While in Washington D.C., President Avery and others visited with Hawaii’s congressional delegation, including Senator Schatz, Congresswoman Gabbard and Congressman Takai.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“I want to sincerely thank the members of The Outdoor Circle for their devoted service to Hawaii, and congratulate this great organization on being honored by Keep America Beautiful,&#8221; said Congressman Mark Takai. &#8220;I was proud to work alongside The Outdoor Circle and other state legislators to help create the Hawaii Environmental Court. We need to protect Hawaii’s natural beauty, and the establishment of this court will go a long way toward preserving our Islands for future generations.”</p>

<p>Keep America Beautiful is a national non-profit working to protect the environment, improve communities, and beautify public spaces. The establishment of environmental courts in the U.S. as a way to improve environmental protection is a key goal of both organizations.</p>

<p>The Outdoor Circle partnered with Keep the Hawaiian Islands Beautiful, the Hawaii affiliate of Keep America Beautiful, to advocate for the establishment of Hawaii’s Environmental Court. A court specializing in environmental cases will help to improve enforcement against violations of our public trust resources, such as road-side dumping, illegal fishing, and water contamination.&nbsp; Hawaii’s court will go into effect on July 1, 2015.</p>

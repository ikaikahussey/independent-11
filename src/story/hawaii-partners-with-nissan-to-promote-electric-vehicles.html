<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The State of Hawaii and Nissan North America announced a partnership to advance zero-emission mobility by promoting the development of electric vehicles, and an electric-vehicle charging network, throughout the state. The partnership, which was announced at the Asia Pacific Clean Energy Summit and Expo in Honolulu, marks Nissan&#8217;s first definitive agreement in the United States to foster the adoption of electric-vehicle technology. </p>

<p>&#8220;This partnership personifies Hawaii&#8217;s commitment to a future powered by clean, sustainable sources of energy,&#8221; said U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye. &#8220;More than 90 percent of the fuel and energy we consume in Hawaii is the product of imported oil. Given our unique access to clean, renewable, energy sources, Hawaii should serve as a model of what is possible when government and business collaborate to plan a path forward into an energy efficient future.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Nissan LEAF, the world&#8217;s first affordable, zero-emission, all-electric vehicle for the mass market, will be available in Hawaii beginning in January 2011. The Nissan LEAF is a five-passenger compact electric car that uses no gas, creates no emissions, and has no tailpipe. It has a top speed of 90 mph and is powered by advanced lithium-ion batteries, which provide the car with a range of 100 miles on a single charge as tested on the LA4 test cycle, enough to satisfy the daily driving needs of more than 90 percent of Americans and to circle Oahu, Nissan said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hawaii has created a $4,500 State tax credit towards the purchase of an electric vehicle and a $500 State tax credit towards the purchase and installation of a home charging station. The State tax credit, paired with an available $7,500 federal tax credit, could bring the price of a Nissan LEAF, which carries a manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail price of $32,780, to as low as $20,780 for Hawaii consumers.</p>

<p>As part of the agreement, Nissan and the State will develop plans to promote a charging infrastructure for EVs, as well as the deployment, operation, and maintenance of a charging network. </p>

<p>&#8220;I appreciate Nissan&#8217;s confidence in Hawaii and recognition of our commitment to pursuing a clean energy future,&#8221; said Gov. Linda Lingle. &#8220;By bringing the Nissan LEAF to Hawaii and working collaboratively with the State and our partners toward the electrification of transportation, Nissan is playing an important role in helping us achieve the goal of reducing our dependence on imported oil.&#8221;</p>

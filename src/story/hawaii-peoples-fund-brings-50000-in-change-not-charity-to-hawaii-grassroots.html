<p>HONOLULU&#8212;&#8220;Change, not charity&#8221; is the motto used by Hawaii People’s Fund (HPF)</p>

<p>Charity is critical, especially in rough times like these, according to HPF executive director Nancy Aleck, who said the nonprofit&#8217;s approach is different: &#8220;We support community groups working to make change at the root of issues.&#8221;</p>

<p>Established in 1972, HPF raises money to collectively support grassroots groups working for progressive social change throughout the islands.</p>

<p>Through individual donations, donor advised funds, and partial matches from Hawaii Community Foundation, nearly $50,000 in Fall grants was recently awarded by Hawaii People’s Fund.</p>

<p>Hawaii police officers are the highest-paid public employees in the <a href="http://westhawaiitoday.com/sections/news/local-news/police-highest-paid-public-employees.html">state</a>, higher even than college professors, according to a West Hawaii Today analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data released Thursday.</p>

<p>Hawaii’s four counties did little to fight against the state’s police union over a new six-year contract that will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the next four years. An arbitrator’s decision reviewed by <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/08/23/19748-why-didnt-hawaii-counties-fight-back-against-shopo-contract/">Civil Beat </a>on Thursday shows that when county officials had the opportunity to push back against the State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers&#8217; demands for more pay and other concessions, they merely deferred to the union or provided incomplete information that didn&#8217;t withstand the arbitrator&#8217;s scrutiny.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A partial lunar eclipse Saturday will appear magnified in the United States by an effect known as the “moon illusion,” scientists say.</p>

<p>The eclipse will begin 10:17 GMT (12:17 p.m. Hawaii time) when the Moon enters the shadow of Earth.</p>

<p>In many parts of the United States and Canada, the early Saturday eclipse will appear larger because it will occur while the moon is close to the western horizon, according to the report Friday.</p>

<p>Because of the timing, it will not be visible from the United Kingdom or Europe.</p>

<p>According to NASA, low-hanging moons look “unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings, and other foreground objects.” The reason for this is not understood.</p>

<p>“Observers in India, Japan, and parts of East Asia will experience the same phenomenon,” NASA wrote on its website. “They’ll see the eclipse on Saturday evening as the Moon is rising.”</p>

<p>At its maximum, 54 percent of the Moon’s diameter will be covered. This will occur at 1:38 p.m. Hawaii time (11:38 GMT)&#8212;the event will last almost three hours.</p>

<p>Because the Moon, Sun and Earth are not aligned, it will not reach “totality”.</p>

<p>Observers in most of the Pacific including Hawaii, eastern Australia, and New Zealand will be able to enjoy the entire eclipse. In parts of eastern Asia, the later portions of the eclipse will be visible shortly after sunset.</p>

<p>The next eclipse will be a solar eclipse on July 11, 2010 which will only be visible from the south Pacific. There will be a total lunar eclipse visible from North America on the early morning of December 21, 2010.</p>

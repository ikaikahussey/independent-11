"article-excerpt":"College Football Nation's Andrea Adelson blogs that University of Hawaii quarterback Bryant Moniz is expected to play in Saturday's game against Army. Moniz was hammered by linebacker Michael Morgan after a 13-yard scramble down to the USC 5 yard-line and looked woozy when he got up Thursday night. Moniz missed the remainder of the game, and also sat out practice Saturday. No penalty was called on the play, as it appeared Morgan did not intentionally try to hit him in the head. But McMackin sent tape of the hit into the league office for an explanation about why no flag was thrown.",

More Hawaii Red Cross volunteers are expected to be sent to the Gulf Coast over the next few days. </blockquote>  The Red Cross has deployed 2,700 trained disaster workers from throughout the US to assist in the Gulf Coast. According to a release from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's office, 1,500 people have been evacuated with another 1,500 needing rescue.

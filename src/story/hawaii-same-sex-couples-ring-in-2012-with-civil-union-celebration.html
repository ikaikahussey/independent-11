<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Four committed couples from Hawaii will become the first in Hawaii to enter into civil unions on January 1, 2012. Hawaii&#8217;s civil unions law was signed by Gov. Neil Abercrombie earlier this year.</p>

<p>At the end of the 2010 legislative session, civil unions supporters made what some called a miraculous push to get the 2010 version of the bill finally passed by the House, a recurring stopping block for the legislation. It was only when Citizens for Equal Rights (CFER), a group formed to solicit public support for House Bill 444, put together a photo booklet featuring families and individuals in support of civil unions that the bill was brought back to the floor for a vote. The booklet was given to House members to show mainstream community unity for the bill. CFER’s push was credited with further fueling support from Hawaii residents who had not previously spoken out.</p>

<p>However, the bill never made it past the fifth floor of the State Capitol. When then-Gov. Linda Lingle announced her veto of House Bill 444 in July, equal rights advocates who had gathered on the State Capitol rotunda were left stunned. Some sat slouched over, staring blankly. Others stood, shouting in unison with the round-up of LGBT leaders, some shrieking, at times. “Shame on you, Lingle!”</p>

<p>Lingle said that Hawaii’s civil unions decision should not be left up to her, but to the majority of voters in the coming election.</p>

<p>That election, Abercrombie came out on top, and civil unions in Hawaii become a reality in 2012.</p>

<p>The CU in Hawaii 2012 Planning Committee, a coalition of LGBT organizations and supportive individuals, have planned a celebration to mark the historic event and join the families and friends of four couples as they achieve a legal status previously denied them.</p>

<p>The coalition comprising the CU in Hawaii 2012 Planning Committee includes Citizens for Equal Rights, GLBT Caucus of the Democratic Party, Honolulu Pride, Integrity Hawaii, PFLAG Oahu, Pride Alliance Hawaii, and Pride at Work Hawaii.</p>

<p>All participants will gather before midnight on New Year&#8217;s Eve at a private home in East Oahu. Participants will first recognize those involved in the more than 20-year effort to achieve legal recognition in Hawaii for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) couples.&nbsp; Shortly after midnight, the four couples will enter into their civil unions. The celebration will also include acknowledgement of couples who have already entered into civil unions or marriages in other states or countries whose relationships will now be legally recognized in Hawaii.</p>

<p>“There are many people in Hawaii who are very excited and have waited a long time for this day to finally arrive,” said Tambry Young of Citizens for Equal Rights and Department of Health Task Force member. “Just after midnight, as the New Year begins, couples will be able to stand before their family and friends and have their love and commitment legally recognized by the state of Hawaii. We are very grateful to the DOH for their efforts in getting the new online system up and running making it possible for couples to have their civil union as soon as the law takes effect.”</p>

<p>The Civil Unions law, which was signed by Governor Neil Abercrombie on February 23, 2011 as Act 1, grants same-sex and opposite-sex couples who enter into civil unions the rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities granted to married couples in the state of Hawaii. </p>

<p>Those couples wishing to have a civil union prior to January 3 will need to make arrangements with a licensing agent in advance to obtain their civil union license as the DOH will be closed until January 3, 2012.&nbsp; For more information about obtaining a civil union, go to the Civil Unions section of the DOH website at <a href="http://www.hawaii.gov/health" target="_blank">www.hawaii.gov/health</a> or call (808) 586-4400.

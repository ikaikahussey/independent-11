<p>With a slight shuffling of players from the previous Senate, it will be interesting to follow these assignments into the start of the legislative session, which begins in January. The House committee assignments come out tomorrow. It remains to be seen how the make-up of the next State Legislature will affect its ability to pass laws in critical areas like land use, food security, renewable energy, smarter development, government transparency, houselessness, conservation, fixing the University of Hawai‘i System and the public school system, health care and diversifying our economy and agricultural sector. More analysis to come.</p>

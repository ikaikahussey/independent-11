<p>State Sen. Clayton Hee is drumming up support in Saipan for an anti-shark finning law, similar to one he had written for Hawaii. Shark finning is the commercial fishing practice of landing a shark caught by hook or net and cutting off its fins. The rest of the shark is then thrown back into the ocean as trash. Many times the shark is still alive and tries to swim away after being thrown back in, but it is doomed to drown without fins. <a href="http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=105576&amp;cat=1" title="Saipan Tribune reports.">Saipan Tribune reports.</a></p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;It’s been eight years since the balmy summer of 2002: a time when the United States began the invasion of Afghanistan, the No Child Left Behind Act was signed into law by George W. Bush, and the U.S. Department of Justice launched its criminal investigation of Enron. It has also been eight years since The Hawaii Shakespeare Festival began a crusade to produce all of Shakespeare’s plays in Hawaii. After eight years, the festival still has until 2012 to accomplish the mission.</p>

<p>Much has changed since those swerving days of the early-oughts ,and among those changes is the festival becoming an institution for fans of theater and, of course, of Shakespeare. The Hawaii Shakespeare Festival has defied its own thespian superlative in 2010, with the first offering <I>Julius Ceasar</i> selling out each and every show of its run. Director Troy Apostol is to be credited, along with is cast and crew, with the breakout production.</p>

<p>Festival Director Tony Pisculli says: “There is a die-hard audience of Shakespeare fans that just want to see Shakespeare done.” </p>

<p>Pisculli created the festival in 2002 along with the coveted talents of R. Kevin Doyle and Harry Wong. The Arts at Mark’s Garage has become the venue of choice for producers of the show.</p>

<p>The success of the festival’s production of <i>Julius Ceasar</i> can be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that it contextualized the high drama and tragedy of the original text with Native Hawaiian culture. It can also be attributed to a smashingly produced playbill. “This is the first time we’ve done a Hawaii-based show. People stole posters off of the walls,” says Pisculli.</p>

<p>It’s easy to disregard how much work goes into a show that breaks box office records. Pisculli is quick to point out that around 2,400 human work hours go into each of the three productions that comprise the Hawaii Shakespeare Festival.</p>

<p>“There is a ridiculous amount of work that goes into this thing,” he says.</p>

<p>The founders of the Hawaii Shakespeare Festival are eager to give credit to Terrence Knapp (to whom the festival is dedicated), the lauded University of Hawaii professor that inspired the festival’s founders. </p>

<p>“I hated Shakespeare when I was in high school,” Pisculli admits.</p>

<p>The festival boasts, worthily, of its patron Dame Judy Dench. Her involvement with the festival stems from a friendship and working relationship with Terrance Knapp. The passion that Shakespeare inspires in those willing to read him remains strong, and the support of such worthy names is surely invaluable for a civic venture such as the Hawaii Shakespeare Festival. But will that bring Dame Dench to Hawaii?</p>

<p>“She has expressed a desire to come to Hawaii,” says Pisculli. “I’m hopeful.”</p>

<p>The Hawaii Shakespeare Festival continues with:</p>

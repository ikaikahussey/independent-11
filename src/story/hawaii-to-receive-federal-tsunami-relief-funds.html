<p>HONOLULU – President Barack Obama declared the damage sustained from the March 11, 2011 tsunami a major disaster, which enables the State of Hawaii to receive federal funding for repairs, Governor Neil Abercrombie announced today. </p>

<p>President Obama has approved Governor Abercrombie’s March 25th request for the federal disaster declaration.&nbsp; A series of joint damage assessments conducted by federal, state, and local teams determined that regions of Hawai&#8217;i County, Maui County, and O&#8217;ahu met the criteria for supplemental federal disaster assistance. Last month, Lieutenant Governor Brian Schatz visited federal stakeholders in Washington, D.C. on behalf of Hawaii.</p>

<p>&#8220;President Obama&#8217;s disaster declaration enables the State to make the necessary repairs to our small boat harbors and other public facilities damaged from the tsunami,&#8221; said Governor Abercrombie. “We have been working quickly and collaboratively to help those affected by the tsunami. This declaration from the President will help us in rebuilding our state and moving forward.</p>

<p>The Major Disaster Declaration will provide 75 percent matching funds for repair or replacement of public infrastructure and not-for-profit facilities in the qualifying counties.&nbsp; The disaster declaration also provides hazard mitigation grant funds statewide.</p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is sending a team to establish a Joint Field Office in the islands.&nbsp; Residents who would like more information about tsunami recovery assistance can call 2-1-1.</p>

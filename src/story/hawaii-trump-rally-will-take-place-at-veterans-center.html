<p>Hawaii&#8217;s Donald Trump supporters plan to rally at the Oahu Veteran&#8217;s Center on September 10. &#8220;The Oahu Veterans Center provides a wonderful venue for the event and is symbolic of Donald Trump’s long-standing support and dedication to the Nation’s veterans,&#8221; said Gigi Jones, director of Trump&#8217;s Hawaii campaign.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, who has never served in the military and received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War (one for &#8220;bone spurs&#8221;), said in an interview with ABC News&#8217; George Stephanopoulos, that he believes he has sacrificed just as much as those who have served in the military. It was his first response to a charge at the Democratic National Convention from Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, that he &#8220;sacrificed nothing&#8221; for his country. Trump claimed that he sacrificed by employing &#8220;thousands and thousands of people.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America,&#8221; Khizr Khan said, addressing Trump. &#8220;You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pressed by Stephanopoulos to identify the sacrifices he made for his country, Trump said, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I&#8217;ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I&#8217;ve had tremendous success. I think I&#8217;ve done a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trump also cited his work on behalf of veterans, including helping build a Vietnam War memorial in Manhattan and raising &#8220;millions of dollars&#8221; for vets.</p>

<p>Paul Rieckoff, the founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a nonpartisan group with close to 200,000 members, said, &#8220;For anyone to compare their &#8216;sacrifice&#8217; to a Gold Star family member is insulting, foolish and ignorant. Especially someone who has never served himself and has no children serving. Our country has been at war for a decade and a half, and the truth is most Americans have sacrificed nothing. Most of them are smart and grounded enough to admit it.&#8221;</p>

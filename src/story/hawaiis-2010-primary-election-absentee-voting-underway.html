<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Early walk-in absentee voting for the 2010 Primary Election is underway. Any person registered to vote may cast an absentee ballot. If you cannot vote at your polling place for any reason or you will be absent from the State of Hawaii on election day, you may vote using an absentee ballot. You may also vote at an absentee walk-in polling place before election day.</p>

<p>The primary election is held to nominate candidates who will represent each political party in the General Election. Similarly, candidates who do not belong to a specific party must also be nominated in order to appear on the General Election ballot as a nonpartisan candidate. In Hawaii, a special type of primary called the “Single Party Primary” is conducted according to the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</p>

<p>Hawaii Revised Statutes Section 12-31 provides:</p>

<p>“No person eligible to vote in any primary or special primary election shall be required to state a party preference or nonpartisanship as a condition of voting. Each voter shall be issued the primary or special primary ballot for each party and the nonpartisan primary or special primary ballot. A voter shall be entitled to vote only for candidates of one party or only for nonpartisan candidates. If the primary or special primary ballot is marked contrary to this paragraph, the ballot shall not be counted.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, candidates who belong to a specific party are listed alphabetically by contest on a specific party ballot. Candidates who do not belong to any party are listed alphabetically by contest on a nonpartisan ballot. Each voter is limited to voting for candidates on one and only one color-coded or nonpartisan ballot.</p>

<p>Votes cast by voters on more than one color-coded section are not counted.</p>

<p>Registered voters may vote at any of the following sites between now and September 16.</p>

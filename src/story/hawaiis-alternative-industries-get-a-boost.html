<p>Senators Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono have announced more than $5 million in federal investments from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to help spur growth in Hawai‘i’s agriculture, clean technology, manufacturing and healthcare industries.</p>

<p>“Investments in Hawai‘i’s diverse industries are key to growing our local economy,” said Senator Schatz after the announcement. “These federal funds will help Hawai‘i continue to lead the way in developing vital sectors of our national economy like agriculture and clean technology, encouraging local entrepreneurship and creating new jobs.”</p>

<p>“These awards are an important contribution to Hawai‘i’s ongoing efforts to diversify our economy,” Senator Hirono agreed. “Supporting entrepreneurs in the agriculture, clean tech, and health care sectors will help to create new businesses, good paying jobs, and a more sustainable Hawai‘i. The more we’re able to diversify Hawai‘i’s economy by making these kinds of investments in facilities and other types of infrastructure, the more we’ll see our economy grow.”</p>

<p>The three grants include:</p>

<p>$3 million investment for the High Technology Development Corporation to build an Entrepreneur’s Sandbox at the Collaboration Center in Honolulu. The facility will provide assistance to local entrepreneurs with particular emphasis on growing new companies in the healthcare and clean tech industries. </p>

<p>$2,178,250 for the Kohala Center to support the design and construction of an agricultural business accelerator for small farmers and agricultural marketers in Kamuela. The accelerator will provide assistance with self-sustaining value-added food and fiber production leading to food self-reliance and sustainability. </p>

<p>$72,000 for the Chamber of Commerce of Hawai‘i to support the Manufacturing in Hawai‘i Initiative. This initiative will identify industry obstacles to advance manufacturing and provide resources to connect local manufacturers with local suppliers.</p>

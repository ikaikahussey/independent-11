<p>This June, <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> will be leading a month-long discussion on Hawaii&#8217;s food situation.</p>

<p>For over 1,000 years, the Hawaiian people produced enough food to support an estimated population of one million. Today, 85 to 90 percent of Hawaii’s food is imported. And if current trends continue, Hawaii’s last agricultural lands will be gone by 2040, according to the <a href="http://www.hawaiifarmersunion.org/" target="_blank">Hawaii Farmers Union</a>. Can Hawaii change course in time? Hawaii’s farmers say “yes.”</p>

<p>Stories this month take a closer look at what we eat, what we grow, and what we import in our islands and the potential food options we have available in being sustainable. We&#8217;ll also be looking at the new movement of young, local farmers as well as the burgeoning local restaurant scene.</p>

<p><i>The Hawaii Independent</i> has put together the following food info by the numbers to bring things a little bit into perspective.</p>

<p><br />
<b>How much Hawaii ag land is out there?</b></p>

<b>How many farms does Hawaii have?</b></p>

<p>The census definition of a farm is a place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year.</p>

<b>What&#8217;s Hawaii&#8217;s dairy production like these days?</b></p>

<p>The last commercial dairy farm, Pacific Dairy in Waianae, closed on February 2008. </p>

<p>Both of the state’s two remaining licensed dairy operations are located on Hawaii Island. Production from these farms account for less than 10 percent of the total supply of fluid milk in Hawaii. Only a limited volume of milk produced on Hawaii Island is available for consumers on Oahu, Maui, and Kauai.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hawaii&#8217;s highly charged issue of civil unions is about to try to clear its last hurdle as the governor ponders whether to veto the measure that would enable same-sex and heterosexual couples who are not married to receive the same protections under law as married couples. On Monday, Hawaii Republican Gov. Linda Lingle is expected to include the civil unions bill on her list of bills she may veto. She has until July 6 to indicate her intentions. Otherwise, on that date, the measure will become law without her signature.&#8221;</p>

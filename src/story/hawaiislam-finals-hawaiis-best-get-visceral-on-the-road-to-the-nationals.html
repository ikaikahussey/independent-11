<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Fresh Cafe in Kakaako will host the 2010 HawaiiSlam Finals on Thursday, an event that will determine through elimination rounds the members of this year&#8217;s HawaiiSlam Team. Members of the team will travel to Saint Paul, Minnesota for the <a href="http://www.nps2009bid.50megs.com/" title="National Poetry Slam">National Poetry Slam</a> in August. Twelve of Hawaii&#8217;s most accomplished and respected slam poets will vie for spots. The event itself is a fundraiser to help get Hawaii&#8217;s team to the national event.</p>

<p>National Poetry Slam Champion and HBO Def Poet Mike McGee will perform at the HawaiiSlam Finals. MC Intrepid and DJ Mr. Nick are among others scheduled to perform as well.</p>

<p>Poet Kealoha, founder of First Thursdays and mentor to scores of aspiring poets, offers some insight into the impact slam poets from Hawaii have had on a national level. </p>

<p>&#8220;In the six years that the HawaiiSlam Team has represented Hawaii at the National Poetry Slam, it has made it to the group piece finals once and the semi-finals four times, placing as high as fifth out of 68 teams,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;More than that, though, I feel that we have contributed significantly to the ongoing dialogue and have made many people aware of what we&#8217;ve got going on here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But competition is only one aspect of the art of slam poetry. Sometimes erudite and articulate, and sometimes visceral, slam poetry embraces identity and expression. </p>

<p>&#8220;When you think about it, most of our cultural existence is centered around learning, adding in our mana`o, and then passing it on to the next generation,&#8221; Kealoha reflects. &#8220;Whenever I pass on what I know about poetry, I feel that I am participating in a movement that really addresses our presence in these islands and in this world. My most rewarding achievements come when kids who are timid or who rarely speak at all are transformed into expressive individuals.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) will hold a public hearing to adopt a new chapter under the Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) relating to the establishment of the Hā‘ena Community-Based Subsistence Fishing Area (Hā‘ena CBSFA). The Hā‘ena CBSFA includes state waters within the Hā‘ena ahupua‘a from the shoreline out to one mile. The proposed rules would limit the type of fishing gear and methods that may be used, prohibit the harvest of marine life for commercial purposes, set new daily take and possession limits for certain species and establish the Makua Pu‘uhonua (marine refuge) as a “no entry” sub-zone.</p>

<p>The hearing will be held at Hanalei Elementary School on Friday, October 3, 2014 from 6:30 to 9:00 p.m</p>

<p>All interested persons are urged to attend the public hearing to present relevant information and individual opinion for the DLNR to consider.&nbsp; Persons unable to attend or wishing to present additional comments, may mail written testimony by Friday, October 17, 2014 to the Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR); 1151 Punchbowl Street, Room 330; Honolulu, HI 96813.</p>

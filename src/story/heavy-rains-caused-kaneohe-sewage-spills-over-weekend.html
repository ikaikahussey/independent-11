<p>KANEOHE &#8212; The Cityâ€™s Department of Environmental Services responded 0to two sanitary sewer overflows in Kaneohe over the weekend.</p>

<p>ENV received a call at 9:50 p.m. regarding homes backing up at 243 and 247 Mikiola Drive.&nbsp; Heavy rains and stormwater inundated the collection system causing two private cleanouts to release approximately 1,400 gallons of untreated wastewater into a storm drain that leads to Kaneohe Bay.</p>

<p>Also, wet weather overwhelmed and caused manholes at Kaneohe Pretreatment Facility to discharge an estimated 30,000 gallons of untreated wastewater between 10:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. into Kawa Stream, which leads to Kaneohe Bay.</p>

<p>ENV notified the state Department of Health.&nbsp; The affected areas have been cleaned, disinfected and deodorized. Signing and water sampling is underway.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  </p>

<p>WAILUKU, Maui&#8212;Maui residents and County workers are still dealing with lingering problems from last night’s heavy rains. </p>

<p>The most urgent problem is the possible health threat posed by a broken waterline near Kawehi Place in Kula. Water Supply officials advise that until the water can be tested residents of Alae, Naalae Road, Waipoli, Polipoli, Waiohuli, Keokea, Ulapalakua, and Kanaio should all boil their water as a precautionary measure against possible contamination. </p>

<p>Also, County work crews are continuing to clear up a culvert near Poli Poli Road. Workers said debris caused the culvert to overflow onto a nearby road. </p>

<p>Roads are still being cleared of mud near the Island Sands condominium in Maalaea. Although county crews cleared most of the 6 to 8 inches of mud that flowed into that area last night a county water truck was expected to spray the remaining mud away today. </p>

<p>Maui police dispatch received numerous calls last night, most of them involving flooding and downed trees. Dispatchers said they did receive one downed tree call this morning near the top of Olinda Road but otherwise received no other weather related calls today. </p>

<p>Also the Maui Planning Commission has decided to hold off more than a dozen site inspections that they were going to have in West Maui tomorrow due to the threat of heavy rains. The commission had lined up 14 different site inspections in what was to be their most aggressive one day agenda ever but will instead hold the inspections on February 3rd. </p>

<p>Mayor Alan Arakawa was part of the county team that kept a close watch on weather related incidents Monday night in the Maui County’s Civil Defense Agency, and said he was proud of how everyone worked together to safeguard lives and property.<br />
 <br />
“We responded quickly to emergencies and tried to be as prepared as we could ahead of time,” Arakawa said. “But I ask that residents please be cautious out there, as the heavier rainfall has yet to hit.” </p>

<p>The National Weather Service predicts showers should start tonight and could grow into thunderstorms by tomorrow. A flash flood watch is now in effect from Wednesday morning through Thursday afternoon. </p>

<p>Forecasters advise that residents monitor the situation and be prepared to take action should an actual flash flood warning be issued.</p>

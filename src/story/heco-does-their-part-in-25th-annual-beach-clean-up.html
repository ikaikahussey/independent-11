<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;Each year, Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) employees can be seen lining Kahe Beach, and this year is no different. In observance of the 25th annual Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup, almost 130 volunteers including employees, retirees, families, and friends did their part to help clean and preserve the Kapolei beach on Friday, September 25.</p>

<p>Kahe Beach, also known as “Electrics” or “Tracks,” is located directly across from HECO&#8217;s power plant and is roughly a mile long. While the City and County of Honolulu already performs beach sweeps throughout the year, there&#8217;s never too much that can be done to keep the beach clean with its constant stream of visitors who enjoy snorkeling, diving, and surfing. The beach also sees its fair share of illegal dumping.</p>

<p>With more people offering to help this year than ever before, volunteer coordinator Mike Carberry had his hands full in planning the event. All volunteers who arrived at 8:00 a.m. for the four-hour trash pick up were quickly briefed on safety and given some guidelines, then put into groups to get to work.</p>

<p>“With the larger turnout, this year’s volunteer groups were able to double their coverage are from ‘Tracks’ beach to the Koolinas, about two miles of shoreline,” said Sharon Higa, HECO&#8217;s spokesperson.&nbsp; </p>

<p>According to Higa, roughly 8,500 pieces of trash were collected, included 427 pieces of used tires from an illegal dumping site; 1023 pieces of trash came from ocean activity related sources, such as fishing and diving.</p>

<p>“Overall the Kahe Beach stretch is looking cleaner thanks to year-round efforts by all beach users. Still, there is much more to be done,” Higa said. “The International Coastal Cleanup is a good opportunity to highlight the impact humans have on the environment, and drive solutions that will protect one of our greatest natural resources, the oceans, and waterways.” </p>

<p>Since 1986, the International Coastal Cleanup has created global snapshots of marine debris collected in one day at sites all over the world. During the event, volunteers record each piece of trash collected. The end report produces valuable information on the types and sources of rubbish, and provides recommendations to eliminate marine debris altogether by reducing it at the source.</p>

<p>Electrical power has been restored to most of Oahu, according to Hawaiian Electric Company and Hawaii Civil Defense.</p>

<p>Governor Abercrombie released a statement this afternoon, calling for HECO and IBEW to immediately resolve the labor dispute</p>

<p>&#8220;Two private entities cannot hold the public interest hostage,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither the public nor I will tolerate delays or punitive tactics by either side.&#8221;</p>

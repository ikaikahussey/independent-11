<p>NextEra Energy, a Florida-based energy firm, has agreed to purchase Hawaiian Electric Industries (HEI) for $2.63 billion in cash and stock, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-03/nextera-agrees-to-buy-hawaiian-electric-for-2-63-billion.html">Bloomberg</a> is reporting. American Savings Bank, a sibling company to HEI, will be sold off as part of the sale.</p>

<p>In addition to the cash and stock, NextEra is taking on an additional $1.7 billion in HEI debt to complete the transaction, bringing the total cost of the deal to $4.3 billion.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time NextEra has expressed an interest in Hawaii&#8217;s energy market. Earlier this year NextEra Energy Hawaii, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, submitted <a href="http://nexteraenergyhawaii.com/pdf/initial_comments.pdf">comments (PDF)</a> to the Public Utilities Commission supporting an undersea power cable to transmit electricity from Maui to Oahu.</p>

<p>Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. stock traded today near a 52-week high, at $28.19. HEI has a market capitalization of $2.891 billion.</p>

<p>While it will retain it&#8217;s Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) name, HEI&#8217;s flagship energy subsidiary will become the third subsidiary of NextEra Energy, along with Florida Power &amp; Light Co. and NextEra Energy Resources LLC. Maui and Hawaii Electric Companies will continue to be managed independently.</p>

<p>American Savings Bank will be spun off as an independent publicly-traded corporation, with HEI shareholders receiving a proportional amount of American Savings Bank stock.</p>

<p>The companies have set up a website, <a href="http://www.forhawaiisfuture.com">www.forhawaiisfuture.com</a>, with information on the deal.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br />
The stock market is responding positively to the sale announcement, with HE shares climbing above $32 in after-hours trading, setting a new record for the stock.</p>

<p>HEEIA&#8212;The <a href="http://www.huihawaii.org" target="_blank">Hui o Koolauopoko</a> will conduct a stream restoration at Heeia Stream on Saturday, June 18. A two-year project is currently underway at the stream to address issues faced by the stream and watershed areas surrounding it. Invasive species, soil erosion and water quality are the major threats to the native watershed.</p>

<p>Volunteers will help clear invasive species and plant native species in the area, as well as propogate new plants for future placement in the watershed. In 2010, over 3000 volunteer hours were spent restoring the Heeia watershed.</p>

<p>Hui o Koolaupoko has also recently been involved with other stewardship projects in the Heeia watershed, including the construction of a “rain garden,” which collects and treats runoff water. The organization has also organized a “Plant Foster Parent” program, which encourages and educates residents about the proper care of native plant species.</p>

<p>Volunteers are asked to wear long pants, a hat, sunscreen, shoes they don’t mind getting dirty, and to bring bottled water. Volunteers may RSVP to nalani@huihawaii.org.</p>

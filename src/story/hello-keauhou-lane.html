<p>Governor Abercrombie, Kamehameha Schools, and Stanford Carr Development announced a new mixed-use Kaka‘ako residential project today. </p>

<p>From the press release:</p>

<blockquote><p> <br />
An estimated 40 percent of the housing units at Keauhou Lane will be reserved for middle-income workers. Renters can earn up to 100 percent of Honolulu’s median income, and fee simple buyers can earn up to 140 percent to qualify. Overall, the project is being designed for the local market. <br />
 <br />
“I commend Kamehameha Schools and Stanford Carr Development for their efforts to build a residential community for the people of Hawai‘i, and fulfilling our goal of making Kaka‘ako a diverse and accessible environment,” said Governor Neil Abercrombie.&nbsp; “Kaka‘ako is a vital component of Hawai‘i’s economic development plan, where local families will be able to live, work and play in Honolulu’s urban core.”<br />
 <br />
Offering a wide selection of well-priced units, Keauhou Lane will provide a variety of choices for individuals, couples and families interested in living within one of urban Honolulu’s most exciting new mixed-use neighborhoods. It is located on the block bound by South, Halekauwila, Keawe and Pohukaina Streets, also known as “Block A” of the Kamehameha Schools’ Our Kaka‘ako master plan.<br />
 <br />
Development work for Keauhou Lane will be a collaboration between Stanford Carr Development and Kamehameha Schools. Stanford Carr’s portion will comprise approximately 93,002 square feet of the property and include a 40-story tower called Keauhou Place, as well as a parking structure for all uses on the block that will be lined with townhomes along South and Pohukaina Streets.&nbsp; Kamehameha Schools’ plans for approximately 69,387 square feet of the property include live-work units, rental apartments and ground floor commercial. Combined, the projects are anticipated to contain almost 50,000 square feet of recreational spaces for the project residents, as well as over 65,000 square feet of open spaces, including fully landscaped sidewalk areas enhanced with features consistent with the City’s “complete streets,” making KS’s overall vision of a walkable neighborhood come to life.<br />
 <br />
“This master planned, neighborhood block is designed for the local market.&nbsp; We are excited to have this opportunity to work with KS and continue to be a part of the new urbanism of Kaka‘ako with this latest development endeavor,” said Stanford Carr Development president Stanford Carr.&nbsp; “Our goal is to bring out the history of this wonderful area, celebrating it through architecture.&nbsp; The diversity of architectural vernaculars that will be layered into the neighborhood will be influenced by historical eras in Hawai‘i as well as modern architecture.”</p>

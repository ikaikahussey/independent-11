<p>HAWAII KAI&#8212;Livable Hawaii Kai Hui invites the public to discover a community treasure: the Wetlands of Hawaii Kai. This Saturday, May 8, a meeting will be held to learn about the Hawaii Kai Wetland, a serene wetland area located below the ancient palms at the base of Mariner&#8217;s Ridge. The meeting will be at the Oahu Club, located at 6800 Hawaii Kai Drive, from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. </p>

<p>&#8220;This event is part of the celebration of Livable Hawaii Kai Hui&#8217;s sixth anniversary,&#8221; President Elizabeth Reilly said. &#8220;To celebrate the anniversary, we are hosting a series of educational gatherings in an overall effort to engage the community and have them join us in a much needed cultural and natural resource renaissance of this area.&#8221;</p>

<p>Co-sponsored by Liveable Hawaii Kai Hui and the Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Center, this event will be an introduction to the history and biology of this wetland ecosystem, which is also a nesting ground of endangered `Alae `ula (otherwise known as the Hawaiian moorhen). Featured speakers include Chris Cramer, from the Maunalua Fishpond and Heritage Center; Ron Walker, former head of the State Division of Forestry and Wildlife; Marjorie Ziegler, the executive director of Conservation Council for Hawaii; and Mardi LaParade, Natural &amp; Cultural Resource Committee, Livable Hawai&#8217;i Kai Hui.</p>

<p>Livable Hawaii Kai Hui is a non profit (501c3) community organization dedicated to upholding the integrity of the East Honolulu Sustainable Communities Plan as well as protecting and celebrating our cultural and natural resources. Serving all of East Honolulu since 2004, the ag lands of Kamilo Nui Valley (and above Kaiser High School) and wild coastal lands of Ka Iwi remain top priorities.</p>

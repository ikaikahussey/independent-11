<p><i>The Hawaii Independent</i> is pushing forward to cover Hawaii&#8217;s political campaigns. It&#8217;s a major election year, with a new governor, Honolulu mayor, and congresspeople on the way, plus a full load of legislators, councilmembers, and of course, OHA trustees. In other words: There&#8217;s a lot to cover, and we need your help! </p>

<p>We&#8217;re building a team of concerned, active citizens, to watchdog the candidates. You&#8217;ll follow the campaigns; attend events; take pictures and update a blog; ask pointed questions of the campaigns and the candidates; and share that information with your community via the HI and other media. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to get involved, drop us a line:</p>

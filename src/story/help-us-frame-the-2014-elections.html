<p>As we approach the 2014 elections, we have a simple question: </p>

<p><em>What would you like this election to be about?</em></p>

<p>In other words, what issues would you like the candidates to be discussing? Are there problems or ideas that they aren&#8217;t discussing?</p>

<p>We’ll use your responses to build a framework for our reporting of the 2014 elections. Your concerns and questions will become the basis for the questions we ask the candidates and the stories we write. It’s part of our effort to make sure that the public has a voice in the political process.</p>

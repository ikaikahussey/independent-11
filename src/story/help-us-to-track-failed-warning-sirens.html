<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p><em>A report from Kona</em>:<br />
They were going off loud and clear in South Kona, but I heard that many of the sirens in Puna and some parts of Hilo did not activate. Hawaii County Civil Defense was flooded with calls from the east said last night from people reporting that the sirens in their area were not working . . .</p>

<p><em>A report from Oahu&#8217;s North Shore</em><br />
We heard them in Waialua around 9 and in Pupukea around 10</p>

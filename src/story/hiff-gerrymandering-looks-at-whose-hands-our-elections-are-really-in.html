<p>Across the country, our two major political parties are gearing up for a once-a-decade war whose winner will control Congress for the next 10 years, and possibly more. Democrats and Republicans collude to keep these skirmishes private so that they can maintain total control over the ultimate political weapon: the ability to directly determine the outcome of elections. Why bother stuffing ballots when they can just draw districts?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the underlying premise covered in the film <i>Gerrymandering</i>, which exposes the most effective form of manipulating elections short of outright fraud. After the 2010 Census is finished, will you know where your district went?&nbsp; </p>

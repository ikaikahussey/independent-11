<p>HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;The U.S. Army is moving forward in the process of obtaining permission to conduct training on &#8220;ceded lands&#8221; on Hawaii Island.</p>

<p>In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, an Environmental Assessment (EA) and draft Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) have been prepared for the implementation of proposed High Altitude Mountainous Environmental Training at Hawaii Island&#8217;s Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA). </p>

<p>The Army intends to conduct high-altitude training flight operations for helicopter aviators and crews. The training meets operational and mission requirements of the 25th CAB, 25th Infantry Division for combat operations in Afghanistan and future related theater actions. </p>

<p>Training activities include but are not limited to: Touch and go, limited landings, approach and departure, reconnaissance, abort and go around, and nighttime operations in designated areas. </p>

<p>The EA concluded that the proposed action would not result in any significant direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse impacts on the natural or human environment.</p>

<p><i>The EA and draft FONSI are available for public review at the following public libraries: Hilo Public Library, Kailua-Kona Public Library, and Thelma Parker Memorial Public and School Library. Copies can also be obtained by contacting NEPA Program Manager at (808) 656-3075 or William.Rogers5@us.army.mil. </p>

<p>Written comments will be received and considered until January 24 and should be directed to the email address above, or mailed to: Directorate of Public Works, Environmental Division (IMPC-HI-PWE), Attn: Mr. William Rogers, 947 Wright Avenue, Wheeler Army Airfield, Schofield Barracks, 96857-5013.</i></p>

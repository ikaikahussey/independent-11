<p>Mayoral candidates Cayetano and Caldwell squared off in front of a live audience at the law school on Saturday in a debate sponsored by the Independent, in partnership with <a href="http://ktuh.org">KTUH</a> and the <a href="http://www.lwv-hawaii.com/">Honolulu League of Women Voters</a>. About a hundred people turned out, taking advantage of the stadium seating to observe a man who could be the next mayor.</p>

<p>The Independent used a community-based approach for this debate: questions were received via the web, social media, and community events, on a broad range of topics beyond rail. A few days before the debate, a committee met to distill a final roster of questions. (Note: <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/call-for-questions-for-mayoral-candidates">Questions are still being accepted</a>. New questions will be posed to the candidates in separate interviews later this month.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.law.hawaii.edu/personnel/soifer/aviam">Professor Avi Soifer</a>, dean of the University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law, moderated the debate.</p>

<p>The tit for tat between the candidates was entertaining, and it spilled into the Twittersphere, where the discussion on the hashtag #hnlmayor became an outright <a href="https://twitter.com/search/?src=hash&amp;q=#hnlmayor">argument</a> between the two camps. You can find our live-tweets of the debate on the Independent&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/theHI">Twitter account</a>.</p>

<p>The conclusion: if rail is your one issue, than your mind was already made up. But if you’re interested in anything else – land development, climate change, language access – there was plenty in Saturday’s debate to think about.</p>

<p><em>Here are some highlights.</em></p>

<h2>Public health</h2><p> (in terms of the NYC ban on large soft drink sizes). <br />
Cayetano: the city and county should be responsible for educating the public on foods. <br />
Caldwell: Honolulu should follow San Francisco’s model by issuing for labelling and disclosure of nutritional values.</p>

<h2>Natatorium</h2><p> <br />
Cayetano: supports keeping Kaimana Beach a space for locals. <br />
Caldwell: we should tear down the pool and leave the memorial to honor war veterans.</p>

<h2>Energy</h2>
<p>Both spoke in favor, in broad terms, of the current ‘big wind’ and undersea cable proposals, with some sort of reciprocity to the host. Surprisingly, neither argued for more self-reliance for O‘ahu.</p>

<h2>Houselessness</h2><p> <br />
Cayetano: should build more affordable rentals for those in need. <br />
Caldwell: supports projects like Hoopili and Koa Ridge in order to create more housing supply, and innovative approaches like safe zones.</p>

<h2>Climate change</h2>
<p>Cayetano: “We should study the matter. This requires long term planning. I will do something about it.” Thankfully, he agreed that it’s a real issue.<br />
Caldwell: Need to remove seawalls to accomodate the moving beach lines.<br />
My take: it was refreshing to hear both candidates talking about climate change as a serious issue.</p>

<h2>PLDC</h2>
<p>Caldwell: There needs to be more county input in the process. The PLDC is in the fixing stage, not the throwing out stage. I think we can work with it.<br />
Cayetano: I understand the Gov is trying to fast track development. But I would be hard pressed to support any circumvention of the laws that meant to protect our way of life.</p>

<h2>Emergency services</h2>
<p>Caldwell: Strong supporter of merging EMS with Fire Dept, arguing it not only saves costs, but more lives due to quicker response. <br />
Cayetano: Combining EMS &amp; Fire should be debated and discussed, but we must consider the costs. Adding 21 ambulances and increasing payroll costs are an issue.</p>

<h2>Public parks</h2>
<p>Cayetano: City is understaffed. Transit will drain money from parks. #hnlmayor <br />
Caldwell: Worked to improve Hanauma Bay experience during his tenure in the Mayor&#8217;s office, and fixed problems that stemmed from lack of hands-on maintenance.</p>

<h2>Spectre of quid pro quo for campaign contributions</h2>
<p>Cayetano: &#8220;My admin was free of scandals. Look at my record.&#8221;&nbsp; <br />
Caldwell: Publicly-supported elections are the only way to fix this.</p>

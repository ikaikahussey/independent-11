HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii premiere of Dana Brown’s new film <i>Highwater</i> will hit the big screen at Ward Stadium 16 on Thursday, Aug. 26 at 8:00 p.m. All of the proceeds from this premiere will benefit the Surfrider Foundation’s Hawaii Chapters and their programs to protect our coastlines.</p>

<p>The Surfrider Foundation is a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to the protection and enjoyment of our world&#8217;s oceans, waves, and beaches. Founded in 1984 by a handful of visionary surfers in Malibu, California, the Surfrider Foundation now maintains over 50,000 members and 90 chapters worldwide. There are four Surfrider Chapters in Hawaii focusing on water quality, beach access, plastic marine debris, and responsible coastal stewardship. For more information about Surfrider&#8217;s Chapters, go to <a href="http://www.surfrider.org/oahu" title="www.surfrider.org/oahu">www.surfrider.org/oahu</a>.</p>

<p><i>Highwater</i> is a story of triumph, tragedy, and brotherhood, and it exposes the heart of the Pipe Masters and the annual Triple Crown competitions on the North Shore of Oahu. Set against a picturesque background and packed with heart-stopping action, director Dana Brown’s documentary brings the drama, humor, and humanity of this riveting, nearly two month-long competition to life. This is a story of life and death, paradise lost and found. </p>

<p>The film features Andy Irons, Malik Joyeux, Kelly Slater, Sunny Garcia, Rochelle Ballard, Brian Keaulana, Tom Curren, Jon-Jon Florence &amp; family, Carissa Moore and many more. </p>

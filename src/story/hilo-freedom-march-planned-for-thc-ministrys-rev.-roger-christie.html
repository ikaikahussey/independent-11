<p>A rally and march in support of Rev. Roger Christie is scheduled for today (Wednesday, September 22) in Hilo at 3:00 p.m. at the Bandstand.</p>

<p>Christie was arrested by federal agents on July 8, along with 13 members of his THC Ministry congregation. All of the â€œGreen 13?&#8212;as they are known locally&#8212;have been released on bond. But Christie himself was denied bail and remains behind bars at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center (FDC) awaiting trial next year on Marijuana Trafficking charges. <a href="http://cannabis.mensnewsdaily.com/2010/09/06/cannabis-charity-plans-new-march-for-roger-christie/" title="Men's News Daily reports.">Men&#8217;s News Daily reports.</a></p>

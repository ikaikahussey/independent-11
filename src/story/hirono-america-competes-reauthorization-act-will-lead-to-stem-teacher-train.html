<p>“Hawaii’s science and tech companies can benefit from this bill to become stronger and even more competitive,” Hirono said.</p>

<p>Hirono pointed to several inventors in Hawaii who would benefit from the funding:</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <b>Patrick Sullivan’s Oceanit</b>, which has invented smart hospital beds that more effectively monitoring patients’ vital signs.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <b>EVAs (Emergency Vision Assurance System)</b>, whose president, Bertil Werjefelt, invented the only proven technology to ensure pilots can see in situations where there is unstoppable smoke in airplane cockpits.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <b>Dr. Hank Wuh’s Cellular Bioengineering Inc.</b>, which produces a de-contamination hydrogel that has already been used for the Gulf Coast clean-up and has the capacity to clean up radioactive contamination.</p>

<p>Under the reauthorization, Hawaii’s universities will continue to be eligible for numerous grant opportunities, including funding for new majors and undergraduate through postdoctoral research fellowships, Hirono said. The Hawaii State Department of Education will be eligible for grants to support STEM teacher training and Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate programs.</p>

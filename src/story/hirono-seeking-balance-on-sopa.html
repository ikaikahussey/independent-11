<p>Congresswoman Mazie Hirono issued the following statement today regarding the Stop Online Piracy Act:</p>

<blockquote><p>Selling counterfeit products online - be it fake &#8216;name brand&#8217; purses or a movie you don&#8217;t own&#8212; is a serious issue that should be addressed in a way that also balances the need to preserve an open, innovative internet. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m continuing to talk with my constituents, like I did last week at my coffee talks in Hilo and Maui, to hear their views on the Stop Online Piracy Act as well as any alternatives that come forward as a result of this debate.</p>

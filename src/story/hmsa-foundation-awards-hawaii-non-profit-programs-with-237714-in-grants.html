<p>The HMSA Foundation is a nonprofit, tax-exempt private charitable organization. It was founded in Hawaii in 1986 as a public foundation with the goal of stimulating research aimed at some of the pressing issues that confronted Hawaii’s health care industry. In 1997, the Foundation was converted to a private foundation to allow for larger contributions from donors, such as HMSA.</p>

<p>The mission of the HMSA Foundation is to extend HMSA’s commitment to provide community access to cost-effective health care services, promote health, provide health education and relevant research, and improve social welfare in Hawaii.</p>

<p>Health plan dues from HMSA members and employer groups are not used to fund Foundation grants.&nbsp; Foundation grants are funded with annual investment income earned on its original endowment.&nbsp; For more information on the HMSA Foundation, please visit www.hmsafoundation.org.</p>

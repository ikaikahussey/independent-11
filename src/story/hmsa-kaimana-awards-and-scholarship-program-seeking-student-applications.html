<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA) is reminding student athletes that applications for the HMSA Kaimana Awards and Scholarship Program must be received by February 18. A total of 21 scholarships valued at $2,000 each will be awarded to high school seniors graduating in the class of 2011.</p>

<p>Students must submit applications to the Hawaii High School Athletic Association (HHSAA). Applications are available on the <a href="http://hmsa.com" target="_blank">HMSA website</a> and the <a href="http://www.sportshigh.com" target="_blank">HHSAA website</a>. </p>

<p>Awards are based on the student’s athletic and academic achievement, community involvement, and sportsmanship, with special focus given to students in lower-profile sports. An additional $1,000 will be awarded to three distinguished recipients.</p>

<p>“HMSA Kaimana Scholarship winners are outstanding students who excel both on and off the field and demonstrate a spirit of volunteerism in their communities,” said Robert P. Hiam, HMSA president and chief executive officer.</p>

<p>Applicants must be Hawaii high school seniors graduating in 2011 with a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.75 in their senior year. They must also have played on at least one of their school’s athletic teams during the current school year in a league-sanctioned sport.</p>

<p>Student athletes must submit a short essay on why they believe they deserve a scholarship, two letters of recommendations from faculty members, and verification in writing by a member of the school faculty of their GPA.<br />
 <br />
Scholarship recipients will be notified in writing in May, and will be recognized at the HMSA Kaimana Awards and Scholarship Program luncheon on June 25 at the Hawaii Prince Hotel in Waikiki.</p>

<p>The HMSA Kaimana Awards and Scholarship Program began in August 2005. The program recognizes outstanding all-around achievement by public and independent high schools, rewards individual student athlete accomplishments with scholarships, and supports excellence in coaches’ education. The program measures success in the areas of athletics, academics, sportsmanship, and community service.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA), in conjunction with the Hawaii Department of Education (DOE) and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), today announced the launch of the 2011 HMSA Teen Video Awards Contest. The annual video contest challenges local middle and high school students to create public service announcements (PSAs) focusing on important teen health issues.</p>

<p>The HMSA Teen Video Awards Contest began in 2003 as a way to raise awareness of health issues affecting Hawaii’s youth, inspire youth dialogue, and support nontraditional learners.</p>

<p>This year’s theme is, “Your choices today impact tomorrow.” </p>

<p>Students will incorporate the theme into their videos and submit them in one of the following categories: mental health, physical health, or social health.</p>

<p>Middle and high school students must submit fully produced PSAs that do not exceed 27 seconds in length. Judges will select winners based on content, impact/effectiveness, creativity, and videography. Winning videos will be broadcast on local television stations.</p>

<p>Winners will receive funds for their school to purchase video equipment or software. The prizes in each category are as follows: 1st place receives $1,500, 2nd place receives $750, and 3rd place receives $300. The Best of Show will receive an additional $1,000. </p>

<p>The Hawaii Meth Project and MADD will also award special prizes for the top video that supports the “Not Even Once” meth campaign message and underage drinking prevention, respectively.</p>

<p>The public can also vote for their favorite video at <a href="http://hmsa.com" title="hmsa.com">hmsa.com</a> from 8:00 a.m. on April 4 through 4:00 p.m. on April 15. The video with the most votes will win a People’s Choice award worth $500. </p>

<p>Deadline for submissions is March 7. HMSA will notify finalists in early April and announce the winners at a gala awards ceremony on May 4 at the Hawaii Convention Center. </p>

<p>Information packets, including contest rules, entry forms, release forms, and copyright information, have been distributed to schools statewide. All forms must be signed and submitted by March 7, along with the finished PSA. HMSA will accept both group and individual entries. Contest information and entry materials are also available on <a href="http://hmsa.com" title="hmsa.com">hmsa.com</a>.</p>

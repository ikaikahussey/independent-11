<p>WAHIAWA&#8212;Zoe Golonka, a second grader at Wahiawa&#8217;s Hoala School, won first place in her division and second place overall in the central region for the Wahiawa Lion&#8217;s Club &#8220;Sight is Beautiful&#8221; poster contest. Third grader David Yanaqawa won third place in his division. </p>

<p>Helen Keller was the inspiration for the Sight is Beautiful theme, and was also the inspiration for the Lion&#8217;s Club effort to create awareness for the blind. For the contest, the children were asked to show their appreciation of the gift of sight through their art.</p>

<p>In an effort to prepare students for their art, Hoala art teacher Tina Markel blindfolded her students and lead them through the school&#8217;s garden to experience what it felt like to be sightless and test their ability to rely on other senses. Children in kindergarten through sixth grade made their way around the garden by touching trees, water, walls, fences, and more while trying to have full awareness of space and ground and the environment around them without being able to see. </p>

<p>According to Darlene Dela Cruz, Ho&#8217;ala&#8217;s office manager, the children were able to appreciate and experience the world of the sight challenged. Through their sightless experience, the children found inspiration for their artwork which depicted what they found beautiful around them.</p>

<p>WAHIAWA&#8212;In keeping with the school&#8217;s motto of helping others, Hoala School&#8217;s second through fifth graders visited Arc of Hawaii&#8217;s Wahiawa members to sing Christmas carols and play flute-a-phones and recorders to spread Christmas cheer. The elementary schoolers performed at Dot&#8217;s Restaurant in Wahiawa during the Rotary Club meeting. </p>

<p>The Arc Hawaii is the state chapter of The Arc of the United States, the largest national organization devoted solely to working on behalf of people with intellectual disabilities while promoting and protecting the human rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>

<p>Students were led by their music teacher Karen Miyamoto and performed &#8220;Christmas is a Time for Love,&#8221; &#8220;Jingle Bells,&#8221; and &#8220;Mele Kalikimaka.&#8221; The performance is an annual event, and is something Rotary Club members and the Arc community look forward to each season.</p>

<p>Community service programs are embedded within the Hoalaâ€™s curriculum in ways that are age appropriate to each grade. The school has partnered with various nonprofit and governmental agencies throughout Oahu and the outer islands to help the students contribute to the community in a variety of creative ways in hopes of providing the students with a greater awareness of the needs of their community.</p>

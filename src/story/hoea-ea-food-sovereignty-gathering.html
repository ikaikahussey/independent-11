HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;Hoea Ea, which means “return to freedom,” is the name given to what have become yearly gatherings promoting food sovereignty in Hawaii. The first event was held Waianae on Oahu in 2006. This summer the Hawaii Island Hoea Ea was held at Onekahakaha Beach Park, Keaukaha at the Lihikai Cultural Learning Center, where it has been held for the past three years.</p>

<p>The Lihikai Cultural Learning Center is located thirty yards from the beach on a site that was once occupied by Native Hawaiians who had no place to live. Their struggle to avoid eviction ended up with a promise from Hawaii County to make the land available for cultural uses. Uncle John Keoni Aweau Turalde, who is a fisherman, paddler, and carver, held the county to their promise when he dedicated the site to the art of carving. Although Uncle Keoni is confined to a wheelchair with more then half his body paralyzed after a car accident, his active lifestyle has enabled him to rebuild his strength.</p>

<p>With the help of family, friends, and community service volunteers&#8212;including clients of Big Island Substance Abuse Council, inmates from Hale Nani, and the children of Lanakila Learning Center&#8212;Uncle Keoni saw to it that the land was cleaned. After those years of hand clearing, he oversaw the planting of everything from coconut to kalo (taro). In the process, Awaao, a fishpond that had not been used for many years, was uncovered. The grand plan is for the fishpond and the food planted at the center to become part of a vital food resource for the Keaukaha community.</p>

<p>This Hoea Ea event took place from July 7 through July 11, with most of the 100-plus participants camping on site. It featured many hands-on learning experiences including building an imu as well as preparing the sausage, kalua pig, and smoke meat that was cooked in it all from a pig butchered on site. Other delicious, homemade food items were enjoyed throughout the weekend with busy helpers making and sampling coconut milk; even kulolo made from that milk. The food shared at the event was, for the most part, the same diet Native Hawaiians ate in pre-contact times.</p>

<p>Living a healthy and sustainable lifestyle was the theme stressed during the gathering. While participants learned how to maintain the fishponds, weave baskets, carve, and make dyes, they were also taught the importance of recycling and composting. Delicious meals were followed by discussions about diabetes, and anyone who attended was welcome to receive ten minutes of lomilomi massage, free.</p>

<p>Nicole Kruse, 16, attended the first day and said the event was “great way for people who want to learn more about Hawaiian culture.” </p>

<p>Nicole’s niece, Rachel Kruse said: “The fishpond was awesome.” </p>

<p>Rachel, who is just seven, was also impressed by the uncles who butchered the pig. </p>

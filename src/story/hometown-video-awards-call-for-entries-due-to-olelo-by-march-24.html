<p>The Alliance for Community Media is seeking entries for the  2010 National Hometown Video Awards.</p>

<p>The Hometown Video Awards honors and promotes community media and local cable programs that are distributed on Public, Educational, and Governmental (PEG) access cable television channels. Awards are presented to creative programs that address community needs, develop diverse community involvement, challenge conventional commercial television formats, and move viewers to experience television in a different way. Hometown is local cable&#8217;s largest video awards competition.</p>

<p>All entries will be due to <a href="http://www.olelo.org/locations_mapunapuna.htm" title="Olelo's Mapunapuna Community Media Center">Olelo&#8217;s Mapunapuna Community Media Center</a> by Wednesday, March 24.</p>

<p><b>Eligibility:</b></p>

<p>The Hometown Video Awards welcome non-commercial programming from media professionals, non-professionals and youth. With the exception of the website categories, programs entered must have had their first telecast on a local cable access channel on or between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009. Some categories require specific criteria to be met in order for an entry to be eligible. Be sure to read the category descriptions carefully so that your entry will not be disqualified.</p>

<p>Follow these three steps to enter:</p>

<p><b>Step One:</b></p>

<p>* Review the Hometown Entry Booklet at the link below for information on categories and eligibility at <a href="http://www.alliancecm.org/sites/default/files/Hometown%20Entry%20Booklet.pdf" title="http://www.alliancecm.org/sites/default/files/Hometown%20Entry%20Booklet.pdf">http://www.alliancecm.org/sites/default/files/Hometown%20Entry%20Booklet.pdf</a>.</p>

<p><b>Step Two:</b></p>

<p>*&nbsp; After reviewing the booklet and deciding which video to enter in which category (there are 44 categories) log on and fill out the online entry form at <a href="http://www.alliancecm.org/hometown" title="http://www.alliancecm.org/hometown">http://www.alliancecm.org/hometown</a>. This entry form will allow you to make payment online. Select the $40 Organizational membership fee and enter in the &#8220;Standard Entry&#8221; category as only PEG organizations are permitted to enter the &#8220;Overall Excellence&#8221; category.</p>

<p><b>Step Three:</b></p>

<p>* You will receive an email confirmation from Hometown after you submit your entry online.&nbsp; Print out that email and bring a copy of it with your DVD to Olelo&#8217;s Mapunapuna CMC by Wednesday, March 24. Since Olelo is a member of the Alliance, our clients are eligible for the discounted $40 entry fee if they enter through Olelo. Entries must be shipped by Olelo for the discount to apply. If you prefer to enter the contest on your own, the entry fee will be $70 per entry plus shipping.</p>

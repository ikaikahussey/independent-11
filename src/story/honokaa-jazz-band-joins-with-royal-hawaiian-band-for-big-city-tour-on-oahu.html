<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In honor of National Jazz Month, the 32-member Honoka’a Jazz Band from the Big Island has scheduled a “Big City Tour” of Oahu with several performances and appearances from April 14-17. Rep. Mark Nakashima, who graduated from Honoka’a High School and is a big fan of jazz music, arranged for the group to open for the Royal Hawaiian Band on the grounds of the Iolani Palace on Friday.</p>

<p>The Honoka’a Jazz Band is the pride and joy of Honoka‘a High. In 2010, the music program at Honoka&#8217;a High School was selected by the National Association of Music Merchants Foundation (NAMM) as one of 138 schools in the United States with an outstanding music program and commitment to music education. They are also the recipients of the prestigious 2011 Grammy Signature Schools Enterprise Award. Gary Washburn, the band director, recently received the 2011 Claes Nobel Educator of Distinction Award from the National Society of High School Scholars.</p>

<p>This year the band’s repertoire includes the music of Benny Goodman, Dizzy Gillespie, Dusty Springfield, Miles Davis, Bobby Timmons, Michael Buble, Patsy Cline, Amy Winehouse, Aretha Franklin and a special arrangement of Pachelbel&#8217;s &#8220;Canon in D&#8221;.</p>

<p>“Honoka’a High School’s music program demonstrates that with dedicated staff, parental and community support our children in rural Hamakua can compete and be recognized nationwide,” said Rep. Nakashima. </p>

<p>The Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s National Museum of American History has led the initiative for Jazz Appreciation Month, or JAM, “to draw public attention to the glories of jazz as both an historical and a living treasure.” According to the Smithsonian’s website, during the month of April musicians, concert halls, schools, colleges, museums, libraries, and public broadcasters are encouraged to offer special programs on jazz. </p>

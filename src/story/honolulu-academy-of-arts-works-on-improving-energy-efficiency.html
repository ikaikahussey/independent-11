<p>HONOLULU&#8212;After having Energy Industries, LLC complete a comprehensive energy assessment, the Honolulu Academy of Arts announced that is has secured the firm to carry out major infrastructure improvements that will enhance maintenance and protection of its artwork and also result in increased energy efficiency and reduction in energy costs.</p>

<p>The project starts this month, and comprises six energy conservation measures primarily focused on the museum&#8217;s air-conditioning system. The largest measure is the replacement of three aging, unconnected chillers with two new energy-efficient chillers that work in tandem. Should one malfunction, the other can serve as backup. This machinery is crucial in the maintenance of the museum&#8217;s artwork, providing the necessary climate control in the galleries and vaults. The smallest measure involves installing devices to control the fan speed in the museum cafe&#8217;s walk-in freezer.</p>

<p>The entire project will cost $1.5 million. Once the nine-month project is completed, the Academy&#8217;s energy consumption will be reduced by 28 percent, which translates to savings of an estimated $250,000 annually.</p>

<p>The system overhaul will be done with minimal impact on the museum&#8217;s scheduled operations as shut downs will be done on days when the museum is normally closed to the public.</p>

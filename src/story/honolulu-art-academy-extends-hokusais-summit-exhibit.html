<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The exhibition <em>Hokusai&#8217;s Summit: Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</em>, which opened September 24, has been inspiring visitors to linger in the gallery and to return to further contemplate the exquisite woodblock prints.</p>

<p>In response to the show&#8217;s popularity, the Academy is extending the exhibition by three days, so that the public can take advantage of the museum&#8217;s monthly free first Wednesday.</p>

<p>&#8220;By extending the show through January 6, people have the opportunity to see it one last time for free. It&#8217;s a thank you to the many visitors who have enthusiastically embraced this exhibition, returning again and again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Academy took its exhibition design to a new level with <em>Hokusai&#8217;s Summit: Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</em>, integrating interactive components into the gallery. Elements such as a desk where people can write haiku and printing stations where people could make their own woodblock prints engaged visitors of all ages.</p>

<p>Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) was one of the most prolific Japanese artists of the late Edo period (1615-1868). During a career spanning more than seven decades, he is estimated to have produced as many as 30,000 works, ranging from paintings and drawings to book illustrations.</p>

<p>He is best known today as a designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints, and in particular was one of the early innovators in the development of landscape prints that characterized the last great development of the ukiyo-e tradition in the 19th century. His print &#8220;The Great Wave Off Kanagawa&#8221; is one of the most influential and recognizable designs ever made.</p>

<p>The exhibition is curated by Sawako Chang, Project Manager and Japanese Art Research Assistant for the Academy?s Asian Art Department.</p>

<p>This exhibition is supported by a grant from the Hawai ªi Council for the Humanities and is officially endorsed by the Consulate General of Japan in Honolulu.</p>

<p>The Honolulu Academy of Arts&#8217; more than 500 prints by Hokusai, one of the finest collections of its type in the world, and a gift from the late novelist James Michener, includes a complete set of the renowned <em>Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</em> series. Few institutions own the whole set. A monumental accomplishment, this series comprises many of Hokusai&#8217;s most famous prints, including &#8220;The Great Wave Off Kanagawa,&#8221; &#8220;Mount Fuji in Clear Weather&#8221; (commonly known as &#8220;Red Fuji&#8221;), and &#8220;Thunderstorm Beneath the Summit.&#8221;</p>

<p>This special exhibition will present the entire series. Fragile and sensitive to fading, many of the prints in this series are among the Academy&#8217;s rarest and most precious works, and they are placed on public display infrequently. This will be an exceptional opportunity to see some of the museum&#8217;s signature works of art, and the first time in a decade that the complete series has been displayed.</p>

<p>The series will be accompanied by other prints from Hokusai revealing his remarkable output, and later works inspired by the series that show the central place of Mount Fuji as a symbol of Japan.</p>

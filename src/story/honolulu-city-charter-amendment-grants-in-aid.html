<p>This amendment seeks to authorize the City to implement a Grants-In-Aid program.&nbsp; The state government has a Grants-In-Aid program, where a portion of state tax dollars are set aside for 501c3 organizations (non-profit organizations) to use to fulfill basic public services.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Proponents contend that this amendment is important to ensuring the City fulfills its obligation to provide basic government services for those in need. Many contend that non-profit organizations are sometimes able to provide essential public services in a more efficient, timely, and cost-effective way than government.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Opponents argue that this amendment is ripe for abuse because there are no standards or process for ensuring Grants-In-Aid are given in a fair and transparent way. They point to the scandal raised by the Grants-In-Aid program at the state level that was used to reward the allies of certain politicians. A more robust application process has since been established at the state level.</p>

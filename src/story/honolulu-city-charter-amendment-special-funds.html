<p>This amendment seeks to authorize the City Council and/or the Mayor to create special funds. Special funds are money that is collected from a specific fee or tax and designated for a specific use in a specific way.&nbsp; For example, the City could impose a fee on all plastic bottles and authorize the money collected from those fees to clean up trash from city parks. Currently, the City&#8217;s ability to collect and segment funds of this nature is very limited, or even non-existent. </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Facility Maintenance will be adding a protective coating on all new city street signs, allowing the quick removal of spray paint and ink graffiti, as well as stickers. Cleaning the treated signs will only require a biodegradable spray cleaner or the use of masking tape.</p>

<p>The City replaces about 300 signs a month because of graffiti and routine maintenance needs&#8212;spending about $100,000 per month replacing damaged signs. Cleaning agents previously used to remove graffiti from signs were either too weak to be effective, or caused damage because they were too abrasive.</p>

<p>The city will also partner with organizations like the Mililani Town Association, which will help clean the newly-installed city roadway signs in Mililani on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Recent efforts by the City and County of Honolulu to make information more easily accessible to the public were highlighted this week by a handful of new downloadable applications. The apps let you see things like real time traffic reports and arrival times for TheBus in your iPhone or web browser.</p>

<p>The eleven web and mobile applications were developed by City employees and private citizens and are available for download from the City’s &#8220;Can-Do&#8221; <a href="http://can-do.Honolulu.gov" target="_blank">public transparency website</a>. </p>

<p><b><a href="http://can-do.honolulu.gov/apps" target="_blank">To view and download the City&#8217;s apps, click here</a></b></p>

<p>Apps include:</p>

<p>CrimeMapping<br />
Disaster Alert<br />
Festivals of Hawaii<br />
Honolulu Map and Walking Tours<br />
Honolulu Tsunami Evacuation Zones<br />
Kokua Traffic<br />
MapMyRide<br />
Oahu Landmarks<br />
TheBusHEA<br />
TripIt<br />
Waikiki Island Guide  </p>

<p>“The City will introduce more ‘apps’ in the near future to help people with their daily lives,” said Department of Information Technology (DIT) director Gordon Bruce. “The public is invited to submit or recommend applications for inclusion on the site.”</p>

<p>Also, the City’s public transparency website has been updated to include current departmental budget data and other information. The website features new operating budgets by agency, along with capital and operating budget reports for the previous fiscal year in an easily reviewable format. Future enhancements will provide the data in downloadable formats that allow users to perform their own reviews. There is also a means to provide direct feedback to the City.</p>

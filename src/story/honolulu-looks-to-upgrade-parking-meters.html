<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu announced that a Request for Proposals (RFP) was released to procure new advanced parking devices.</p>

<p>There are approximately 3,700 municipal parking meters in Honolulu&#8212;all coin operated.</p>

<p>It was determined that the City would benefit by upgrading existing parking meters by using enhanced technology. The City hopes to:</p>

<p>* Increase efficiency of parking revenue collection</p>

<p>* Increase convenience for users by:<br />
-&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Maintaining  the ability to pay by coin<br />
-&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Providing the ability to pay by credit card<br />
-&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Providing the ability to extend meter payment by cell phone<br />
-&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Providing the ability to announce availability of open spaces</p>

<p>The parking device RFP involves a two-step process. First, the City will solicit qualifications from interested proposers; the second step will involve the submittal of a technical proposal by a priority-list of respondents.</p>

<p>The RFP allows for proposals involving either advanced single-space or multi-space parking meters, or both. The City is looking to implement the advanced devices at no up front cost to the City. Implementation would occur over the next year.</p>

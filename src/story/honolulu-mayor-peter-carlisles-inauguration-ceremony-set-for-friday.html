<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle’s inauguration ceremony will be held this Friday, October 22, in the Mission Memorial Auditorium beside Honolulu Hale.</p>

<p>Doors to the auditorium will open at 4:00 pm. Seating will be reserved for special guests, with additional seating available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration tables will be located at the entrance. A large tent will also be set up nearby and equipped with a wide screen television to accommodate the expected overflow of guests.</p>

<p>The ceremony will begin promptly at 5:00 pm, and will be broadcast live on Olelo, Channel 49.</p>

<p>Hawaii Circuit Court Judge R. Mark Browning will administer the oath of office, and First Presbyterian Church of Honolulu Senior Pastor Dan Chun will deliver the invocation.</p>

<p>Jimmy Borges will perform the National Anthem, Cathy Foy will perform Hawaii Pono i, Hula Halau Olana will present a Hawaiian cultural performance, and the Society of Seven will provide a special inaugural performance.</p>

<p>Free parking will be available after 4:00 pm in the Frank F. Fasi Civic Center Parking Structure, which may be entered from South Beretania or Alapai streets.</p>

<p>The Mission Memorial Auditorium is the red-brick, single-storey building closest to the Diamond Head side of Honolulu Hale.</p>

<p>The ceremony is not being held inside Honolulu Hale because the building’s interior courtyard is being utilized as an early polling place for the November 2 General Election.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In Hawaii, there&#8217;s no stigma in living with your parents. And it&#8217;s not just because everyone&#8217;s all about their ohana. Frankly, it&#8217;s really expensive to buy a house here, especially in Honolulu. And the latest Home Listing Report by Coldwell Banker Real Estate LLC reminds us of that fact. </p>

<p>The report is a snapshot survey of U.S. four-bedroom, two-bathroom home listings, which found a $1.7 million difference between America’s most expensive and most affordable housing markets.&nbsp; </p>

<p>According to the report, home listing prices in Honolulu average $1,026,821, making this city one of the most expensive markets in the nation. Honolulu, ranked at number nine, compares to the average listing price of homes in Santa Barbara, California ($1,024,661) and Pasadena, California ($1,043,683).</p>

<p>Newport Beach, California led the list of most expensive real estate markets in America, with an average home listing price of approximately $1.83 million for property listings meeting the subject home criteria. By contrast, America’s most affordable housing market was Detroit, Michigan with an average home listing price of approximately $68,000. This is the first year that Honolulu has placed in the top 10 in studies conducted by Coldwell Banker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here in Honolulu, we are seeing how precious and appealing the beauty of Hawaii is to both local and international buyers,” said Chason Ishii, president of Coldwell Banker Pacific Properties.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also seeing why it&#8217;s so hard for working houseless families and individuals to afford a home.</p>

<p>MAKIKI&#8212;The <a href="http://honoluluacademy.org" target="_blank">Honolulu Academy of Arts</a> presents its 4th annual Honolulu Surf Film Festival, beginning Friday, July 8 and continuing through July 31. The festival will feature 22 films, 16 of which will see their Hawaii premiere. </p>

<p>Opening the festival will be <a href="http://www.honoluluacademy.org/events/films/11723-innersection" target="_blank"><em>Innersection</em></a>, directed by surf film icon Taylor Steele. Steele has become the most recognizable name in surf films, outside of the surfers featured in the movies he makes. He has worked with legends such as Kelly Slater and Hawaii’s own Andy Irons. Not since Endless Summer director Bruce Browne has anyone behind the camera gained the critical and popular acclaim Steele enjoys. </p>

<p>The festival will also highlight the achievements of women in surfing, most notably with <a href="http://www.honoluluacademy.org/events/films/11726-leave_message_women_and_waves" target="_blank"><em>Leave a Message</em></a>, a film that examines the professional success of young women surfers. Hawaii’s Carissa Moore and Coco Ho feature prominently in the movie.</p>

<p>Opening night of the Honolulu Surf Film Festival will take place with a reception in Academy’s Pavillion Courtyard, with free beer provided by Kona Brewing Company and food available for purchase from Whole Foods Market and OnoPops.</p>

<p>The festival closes July 31 with a book signing by Anna Trent Moore, the daughter of Hawaii big wave legend Buzzy Trent and author of Increments of fear. Beer from Kona Brewing and food from Da Spot will be on hand.</p>

<p>The Honolulu Surf Film Festival is a commendable effort by the Honolulu Academy of Arts to embrace and celebrate Hawaii’s contribution to world culture and community through surfing. Tickets are likely to sell out quickly.</p>

<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;<a href="http://www.honoluluzoo.org/" target="_blank">The Honolulu Zoo</a> is developing a comprehensive compliance plan to systematically address various issues that have prevented it from attaining accreditation from the <a href="http://www.aza.org/" target="_blank">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> (AZA).</p>

<p>Last week, the AZA tabled its re-accreditation of the zoo for one year.&nbsp; In addition to noting numerous positive strides taken by the zoo, including its overall physical appearance and a brand new, attractive zoo entrance, the organization raised concerns regarding the filling of vacant personnel positions, repairs and upgrades of animal exhibits, and a lack of sufficient directional signage and educational graphics. </p>

<p>The AZA gave the zoo a list of items to address over the next nine months, at which time the organization will send an inspection team to review the zooâ€™s progress. The zoo will maintain its current accreditation status while the review is pending. Zoo officials have already addressed a number of items noted and plan to address all deficiencies by refocusing existing resources or seeking additional funding from the private sector.</p>

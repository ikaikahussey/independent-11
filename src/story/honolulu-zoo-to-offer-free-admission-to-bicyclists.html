<p>WAIKIKI &#8212; The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Bike to the Zoo Day on Sunday, May 22 will see the Honolulu Zoo offer free admission to visitors who bike to the zoo. </p>

<p>&#8220;We hope this fun, free event helps people see biking as a great alternative to driving a car, especially for shorter trips,&#8221; said Department of Transportation Services Director Wayne Y. Yoshioka.&nbsp; Bike to the Zoo Day is part of the City&#8217;s sustainability initiative and promotes a multi-modal approach to transportation.</p>

<p>Anyone who rides their bike to the Honolulu Zoo will get in free from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. through the Monsarrat Avenue gate.&nbsp; The City will provide free valet bicycle parking and goodies such as blinkers and safety materials.</p>

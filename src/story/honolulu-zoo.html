But walking the zoo grounds, originally leased out by King Kalakaua, I felt removed from the buses and crowds of tourists on the street. I hadn't visited the zoo in almost 15 years, but it was entertaining for a Sunday afternoon with several friends. A nice long walk through various landscapes, and seeing animals like lemurs swinging from trees, orangutans peering through glass, and hippos wading through the water, was a nice alternative to the normal weekend activities. Whether you're an adult or child, visiting town from the country, or looking to feel like you're in the country while in town, for $6 kamaaina, the zoo is entertaining. Be sure to check out the Hale Imi Iki Learning Center.",

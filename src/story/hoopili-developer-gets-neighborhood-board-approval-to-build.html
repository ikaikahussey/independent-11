<p>A developer&#8217;s plans to build on more than 1,500 acres of West Oahu farmland has gained unanimous support from the Kapolei Neighborhood Board last night, <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/14961152/developer-gets-neighborhood-board-approval-to-build-on-keep-some-ag-land" target="_blank">Hawaii News Now reports</a>. D.R. Horton-Schuler Division&#8217;s &#8220;Ho&#8217;opili&#8221; development would be built over a 20 year period on land that includes Aloun Farms. But the developer said more than 250 acres of the farmland will still exist when the building is done.</p>

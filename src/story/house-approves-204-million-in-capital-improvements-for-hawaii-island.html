<p><br />
&#8220;We need to insure that the Senate agrees with the House appropriations for this year, as well as join with us to urge the Governor to release last year&#8217;s appropriations,&#8221; said Rep. Jerry Chang (District 2&#8212;South Hilo, Waiakea Kai, Kaumana, Keaukaha). </p>

<p>&#8220;During these tough times, we are very fortunate to have included in the House budget, funds for our higher education institutions, as well as our schools in the Hilo district,&#8221; continued Rep. Chang.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased that we were able to secure $31 million for the UH Hilo Hawaiian Language Building, and $10 million for our Big Island Community College campuses to renovate the East Hawaii campus and new West Hawaii&#8212;Hawaii Education Center. There is also $8 million for a new Hilo High gym this year, and $8 million for the Keaukaha cafetorium included in last year&#8217;s budget.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is high demand for accessible and adequate public services in West Hawaii,&#8221; said Rep. Cindy Evans (District 7&#8212;North Kona, South Kohala.)&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased there are monies to meet our needs for 1) access to healthcare, 2) improved roads, 3) efficiencies at Kona airport, 4) updating Kawaihae commercial and recreational harbors, and 5) development of water resources.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The latest Council on Revenues forecast for the present fiscal year is optimistic, however I believe the legislature will continue to be cautious while crafting the budget,&#8221; said Rep. Clift Tsuji (District 3&#8212;South Hilo, Panaewa, Puna, Keaau, Kurtistown.)&nbsp; &#8220;I am pleased to note that there are funds for Waiakea High School&#8217;s partially completed all-weather track complex. I also appreciate the moneys for improvements to Hilo&#8217;s Harbor and Airport as these ports are a vital lifeline for the island&#8217;s economy, especially the agriculture industry. In addition, appropriations for projects to the Keaau-Pahoa Road are so important to ensure safer driving conditions on one of the district&#8217;s heaviest traffic corridors. The Big Island delegation continues to work to make these projects a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is still CIP money from last year&#8217;s budget that requires the Governor&#8217;s immediate attention to prevent lapsing,&#8221; cautioned Rep. Tsuji. &#8220;This includes a Kupulau Road extension that will alleviate traffic congestion for Waiakea Uka residents.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following is a list of appropriations for the current fiscal year, approved by the Legislature in 2009. Hawaii Island lawmakers are waiting for the funds to be released by the Governor&#8217;s Office.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am extremely pleased that our community has received $1,526,000 of capital improvement project (CIP) funding for La&#8217;i'opua 2020,&#8221; said Rep. Denny Coffman (District 6&#8212;North Kona, Keauhou, Kailua-Kona, Honokohau.)&nbsp; &#8220;The funding will support architectural planning and design of approximately 130,000 square feet of community facilities built on vacant land owned by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL).&nbsp; The project will extend over 26.75 acres. It is located in the Villages of La&#8217;i'opua within the Kealakehe ahupua&#8217;a.&nbsp; It is a Community Center that will support the greater West Hawai&#8217;i region. La&#8217;i'opua 2020 wants to be a pu&#8217;uhonua (area of safety and peace) for our community.&#8221;</p>

<p> </p>

<p>&#8220;I am pleased that $1.5 million is in the budget for the Puna Makai Alternative Highway,&#8221; said Rep. Faye Hanohano (District 4&#8212;Puna, Pahoa, Hawaiian Acres, Kalapana.)&nbsp; &#8220;This alternate route is needed to relieve congestion and facilitate safe movement for the evacuation of residents and visitors in the event of natural disaster such as tsunami, volcanic eruption flow, and wildfire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While everyone is suffering in this economy, the safety of our citizens is of the utmost concern,&#8221; said Rep. Mark Nakashima (District 1&#8212;North Kohala, South Kohala, Hamakua, North Hilo, South Hilo.)&nbsp; &#8220;The benefits of the Papaikou Traffic Safety Project, which will improve highway conditions and signage, far outweigh its monetary cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The House draft of the budget includes funding for Ka&#8217;u and the surrounding communities to finally have a disaster relief shelter,&#8221; said Rep. Robert Herkes (District 5&#8212;Puna, Kau, South Kona, North Kona.)&nbsp; &#8220;Hawaii is the only state that is impacted by every major natural disaster, and  Ka&#8217;u has the potential of being impacted by them all.&nbsp; This funding replaces the old Ka&#8217;u High School gym with a new gym built to FEMA disaster shelter standards.&nbsp; Our rural area residents and students will now have a safe refuge should any natural disaster occur.&#8221;</p>

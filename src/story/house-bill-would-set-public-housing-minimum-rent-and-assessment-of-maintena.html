<p>The introducer of the House Bill 1303, Rep. Rida Cabanilla (D) said in a statement: &#8220;Reform of our public housing system is urgently needed. ... While I am committed to improving access and availability to affordable public housing, a minimum rent and maintenance fee will assist the Housing Public Authority to improve their ability to maintain units and overall self-sustenance of the program.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cabanilla represents District 42, consisting of Waipahu, Honouliuli, West Loch, and Ewa.</p>

<p>Fetu Kolio, President of the Tenant Association of Mayor Wrights Homes, said in testimony to House committees that &#8220;requiring all tenants to pay a minimum rent will help instill a sense of ownership in our community.‚Äù</p>

<p>House Bill 1303 will be transmitted to the Hawaii State Senate for further discussion and consideration.</p>

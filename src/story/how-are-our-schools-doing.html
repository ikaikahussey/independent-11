<p>Hawaii&#8217;s Department of Education on Monday released its first report card of how public schools are doing under a new accountability system, made possible by a <a href="http://thegardenisland.com/news/state-and-regional/hawaii-releases-st-report-card-under-new-system/article_fae76b40-3236-5496-ae24-91018548ddce.html">federal</a> waiver from certain provisions of the No Child Left Behind law. A key result is that nine schools serving a large number of children from low-income families are among 14 considered the highest-performing and highest-growth schools. The results also show that a majority or the state&#8217;s lowest-performing schools showed growth after receiving targeted support.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Four out of every 5 public schools singled out for restructuring <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20130820__Schools_get_better_grades_.html?id=220308871">under</a> federal standards last year earned improved standings on a new accountability system that looks beyond standardized test scores. The state Department of Education on Monday released the first results using its so-called Strive HI system. </p>

<p>Nearly two out of every 10 of Hawaii’s public elementary students missed school <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/08/19/19721-hawaii-schools-target-chronically-absent-kids/">last </a>year at “chronic” rates that the Department of Education says strongly indicate which kids are at high risk for falling behind and dropping out. Eighteen percent of elementary school children were chronically absent last year, meaning they missed 15 or more days of school, according to data released Monday that outlines the first annual results of the DOE’s new so-called Strive HI Performance System.&nbsp; </p>

<p>State Department of Education Deputy Superintendent Ronn Nozoe, along with Superintendent Kathyrn Matayoshi, were eager to share information on the <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/23176787/hawaii-releases-1st-report-card-under-new-system">new</a> Strive HI Performance System for the 2013-2014 academic school year. Strive HI replaces the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Nozoe says it&#8217;s a far more precise tool for measuring how well a school performs. <br />
 <br />
The Strive HI performance system evaluates Hawaii’s public and charter schools. This new system replaces the federal No Child Left Behind law and analyzes <a href="http://www.khon2.com/2013/08/19/doe-new-strive-hi-system-ranks-hawaii-schools/">student</a> achievement and growth in reading, math, science, graduation rates and attendance.</p>

<p><strong>Styrofoam in Hawaii</strong></p>

<p>A 2009 effort to ban styrofoam on Maui failed due to <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/524688.html">cost concerns</a>. Last year, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/news/newsroom/releases/2011/june10/">added styrene (found in styrofoam) to their list of carcinogens</a>. Earlier this year, large amounts of styrofoam were <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/18564272/mysterious-white-foam-washes-up-on-west-oahu-shoreline">cleaned up</a> at Kalaeloa beach. </p>

It just changes the type of litter.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;re compiling a list of federally-funded Native Hawaiian programs, and we&#8217;d like your help.</p>

<p>Our method is to go through <a href="https://www.cfda.gov">federal grants databases</a>, public statements from Hawaii&#8217;s Congressional delegation, and news sources. We&#8217;re adding these items to a Google spreadsheet, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kE8IfC5JNf_fZdmnPw5uks077vYbtwIVFZVvKCA2_uA/pubhtml">here</a> (and embedded below).</p>

<p><em>The Hawaii Independent</em> has also reached out Congressional and state government staffers for their assistance in identifying holes in our research.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this information useful?</strong></p>

<p>A recurring theme over the last 14 years of federal recognition debate is the importance of maintaining federally-funded programs. We thought it would be useful to find out exactly what those are.</p>

<p><em>Are we missing something in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kE8IfC5JNf_fZdmnPw5uks077vYbtwIVFZVvKCA2_uA/pubhtml">list</a>? <a href="mailto:news@hawaiiindependent.net">Email</a> us, <a href="http://twitter.com/theHI">tweet</a> us, message us on <a href="http://facebook.com/theHI">Facebook</a>, or leave a comment below. This post will be updated as more information is available.</em></p>

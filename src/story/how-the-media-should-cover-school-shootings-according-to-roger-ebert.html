<p>In 2003, <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/elephant-2003">Ebert wrote a review</a> of &#8220;Elephant,&#8221; a film about the Columbine High School massacre. In it he lays out the problem with the media&#8217;s coverage of these events; in short, the problem is the way in which the media makes antiheroes of the villains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Events like this,&#8221; I said, &#8220;if they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news programs like your own. When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and starts shooting, it becomes a major media event. Cable news drops ordinary programming and goes around the clock with it. The story is assigned a logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat Mafia. The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If I shoot up my school, I can be famous. The TV will talk about nothing else but me. Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking. The kids and teachers at school will see they shouldn&#8217;t have messed with me. I&#8217;ll go out in a blaze of glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>In short, I said, events like Columbine are influenced far less by violent movies than by CNN, the NBC Nightly News and all the other news media, who glorify the killers in the guise of &#8220;explaining&#8221; them. I commended the policy at the Sun-Times, where our editor said the paper would no longer feature school killings on Page 1. The reporter thanked me and turned off the camera. Of course the interview was never used. They found plenty of talking heads to condemn violent movies, and everybody was happy.</p>

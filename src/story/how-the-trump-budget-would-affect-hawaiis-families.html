<p>“President Trump’s budget proposal is not just radical, it’s cruel. But make no mistake – this budget is dead on arrival. When the administration tried to cut these programs for this fiscal year, we didn’t let it happen. This time is no different,” said Sen. Brian Schatz today in a statement. “I will fight as a member of the Appropriations Committee to protect the programs that make our local economy and our communities stronger.” </p>

<p>The Trump proposal would cut more than $1 trillion from programs critical to families in Hawai‘i and across the country including:<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Medicaid;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Native Hawaiian Education Act Program;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Social Security Disability Insurance;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Planned Parenthood;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Public health preparedness programs, which help to prepare Hawai‘i and other states for outbreaks like dengue and Zika;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as the Food Stamp Program);<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Emergency Medical Services for Children Program;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Social Services Block Grant, a program that helps support children and families in need;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Community Development Block Grants, a program that helps local governments fund affordable housing and anti-poverty projects;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  National Park Service;<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  National Institutes of Health; and<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8 housing).</p>

"teaser":"Howard Hughes Corp., the property management spin-off from General Growth, announced today its [long-anticipated] plans to redevelop the Ward Centre area.  From the prepared statement: <blockquote> The redevelopment will commence with four components on four separate blocks: two mixed-use residential towers on opposite corners of Auahi Street and Kamakee Street, one reserved housing tower at the corner of Ward Avenue and Halekauwila Street and the renovation of the IBM building, a portion of which will serve as the information and sales center for Ward Village. </blockquote>",

<p>The plans were introduced at today&#8217;s Hawaii Community Development Authority meeting. Duane Shimogawa reports for PBN on the reception to the plans:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, chair of the Oahu Island Burial Council, said that she is in support of the developer’s plans.</p>

<p>But not everyone was onboard with the planned redevelopment.</p>

<p>Dexter Okada, a former HCDA board member and business owner in Kakaako, said he’s concerned about the impact it will have on traffic and parking.</p>

<p>Others in the Kakaako community noted their concerns of building heights and the density of the plan.</p>

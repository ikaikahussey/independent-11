<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Hawaii Pacific University softball team has been under the radar almost their entire season, until now. Even with the success of the Rainbow Wahine softball team and the Rainbow Warrior baseball team, the Sea Warriors have taken their time to shine as it took home its first NCAA Division II Softball Championship title in St. Joseph, Missouri on Monday winning 4-3. The number-three seeded Warriors took on number-two Valdosta State at Heritage Park in the championship match after going undefeated in the tournament leading up to the final.</p>

<p>HPU (50-8) had to rally from behind as the team was down early 2-0 after just one inning and was held to only one hit in the first four innings of the game. However it seemed like luck was against Valdosta State (50-9) from Georgia in the fifth inning. The Blazers allowed HPU six hits and sent 10 batters to the plate for two singles before a pitching change followed with two more singles, giving HPU their first lead 3-2. Then shortly after the lead was extended 4-2 by pinch runner Pomaikai Kalakau, the Blazers would score a run in the bottom of the fifth to make it close. However, even with the bases loaded in the last inning for Valdosta State, the Sea Warriors were able to fight the off with a fly out to center field to record the last out. </p>

<p>“The team put forth everything they had, coming from behind and holding off a bases-loaded rally by Valdosta State in the bottom of the seventh inning to capture their first NCAA Division II title,” Governor Linda Lingle acknowledged in a statement.</p>

<p>After the game, senior second baseman Casey Sugihara, Ciera Senas, Nicole Morrow, and pitcher Sherise Musquiz were all named to the All-Tournament Team. Musquiz was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player after going 4-0 on the week. </p>

<p>The team returned back to Oahu with trophy in hand Tuesday afternoon and had a warm welcome with cheering HPU students, staff, and cheerleaders.</p>

<p>“HPU’s exciting triumph caps an outstanding weekend for Hawaii teams on the diamond, and we are extremely proud of how all of our athletes have represented their university and our state,” said Lingle.</p>

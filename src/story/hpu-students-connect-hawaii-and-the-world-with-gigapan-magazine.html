<p>DOWNTOWN&#8212;Students of Hawaii Pacific University&#8217;s latest &#8220;Writing for New Media Students&#8221; proposed the question: What happens when you give a group of young writers, artists, journalists and producers on the most remote island in the world the opportunity to experiment with collecting a range of images that represent their home? Their answer: Expect a lot of play. Expect a lot of experimentation. A lot of movement.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all here in the Downtown university&#8217;s latest edition of <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yarondy/gigapan_magazine/index.html" title="Gigapan Magazine">Gigapan Magazine</a>, a virtual edition part of the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~globalconn/overview.html" title="Global Connection Project">Global Connection Project</a>, a joint project of Carnegie Mellon University, NASA, Google, and National Geographic. The project&#8217;s long-term goal is to connect neighbors across this globe, and learn about our planet.</p>

<p>In the latest virtual magazine collection, you will see views from locations with particular meaning to the project&#8217;s producers, such as the Nuuanu Pali lookout, Tantalus Mountain, and Waimea Bay. Other images are of more intimate or private settings like Waipuna Lanai or the collapsing view from the rooftop of Eaton Square, while others have thematic or personal resonance like the bustling Chinatown at King Street, or the subtle yet incredibly active Patsy Mink Park in Waipio.</p>

<p>The Hawaii Pacific News crew behind the project consists of an eclectic mix of international students who write, shoot, design, and edit news, entertainment, and opinion for several distribution and archival platforms, including <i>Gigapan Magazine</i>.</p>

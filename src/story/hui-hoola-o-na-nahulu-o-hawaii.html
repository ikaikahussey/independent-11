<p>HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;The Hui Hoola O Na Nahulu O Hawaii site in Kapoho is used as a cultural base to help haumana (students) of the non-profit drug rehabilitation program get in touch with the aina. It is used as a work/camp site by the organization with various youth groups also using the property during the summer. When the catchment tank recently broke, all plans for use were put on hold. Without running water, the program was unable to take anyone to the aina, leaving the site uncared for. With no nurturing, the land became horribly overgrown and the taro were dying.</p>

<p>Live Aloha Day, which happened last Saturday, June 19, was created by Kanu Hawaii, a local non-profit organization that promotes “island-style activism” as a way to help close the gap during these tough financial times. Like Hui Hoola, many groups have projects on hold due to a lack of funding. Over 700 Kanu Hawaii members participated in 17 similar events held throughout the state, on Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kauai.</p>

<p>The goal on Saturday for the East Hawaii crew was to get Hui Hoola’s catchment tank up and ready for use. With so many able and willing volunteers&#8212;20 in all&#8212;the crew also cleaned the taro patch and cleared the land. A “Kanu Hawaii Work Party” sign at the entrance of the driveway greeted Kanu members and Hui Hoola staff who began arriving at 8:00 a.m. and stayed well past the four hours that was asked of them. </p>

<p>During the day, the sound of weed whackers filled the air and all hands were in use. The taro patch was cleaned in no time and huli (cuttings) were made to replant the patch. The catchment tank was put in place just before lunch. The highlight of the day for volunteers was when the water truck came at 2:00 p.m. to dump three thousand gallons of water into the restored catchment tank. The driver from Kalaheo Trucking who delivered the water got a kick out of the response: “I don’t usually have people cheering like this when I deliver water.”</p>

<p>Rachel Kruse, who serves as a certified substance abuse counselor for Hui Hoola was the one who alerted Kanu Hawaii to the organization’s needs. Rachel said that when the day was over, she and other staff members had to sit in the pavilion on site and just soak in the day. “We didn’t leave until about five o’clock,” she said. “It wasn’t about working, it was about being one with the land.” </p>

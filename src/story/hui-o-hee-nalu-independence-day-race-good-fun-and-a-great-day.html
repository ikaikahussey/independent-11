<p>NORTH SHORE&#8212;The 32nd Hui O Hee Nalu Indpendence Day paddleboard race took place on July 4, providing a day of fun in the sun for the approximately 500 contestants and many more who came to watch, barbeque, and socialize. Paddlers of all ages, from barely in the double digits to those over 60 years-old, paddleboarded or stand up paddled (SUP) the four-mile stretch from Sunset Beach to Waimea Bay.</p>

<p>Approximately 200 contestants signed up at early registration at the end of June, with the remaining 300 or so signing up on the beach, setting a record amount of entrants for the race. “I think the SUP division has drawn a lot more people to come out here and enter,” said Lynn Kwan, an Oahu resident who watches friends in the race each year. The race saw a substantial increase from the 402 contestants who raced in 2009.</p>

<p>This year, the majority of contestants were stand up paddlers, a division that was opened in 2007. “ Last year was good, this year was great,“ said stand up paddler Fred Hyun. </p>

<p>This year’s race was the second Da Hui race for Hyun, who explained: “The event itself did not have any hitches, people all over were happy. First timers were spoiled by all that went on.”</p>

<p>The event featured a variety of divisions, including the parent and child division for both paddleboarding and SUP contestants. A few of the many divisions offered include; paddleboard and SUP tandem, paddleboard and SUP menehune, SUP divisions with or without a rudder (fin), stock SUPs, 12’ and under surfboards and more. To pay homage to the Hawaiian culture, a wooden board division has been added, known to be challenging because of the weight of the solid wooden boards. </p>

<p>“A lot of people I know were very happy and glad to be there, even if they weren&#8217;t racing. Participants were happy to reacquaint with old friends and catch up on board designs. There was a little of everything for everyone. It was a very happy and positive event,” said Hyun.</p>

<p>The race brought fun for surfers and spectators alike. Tyler, a long time North Shore resident, said of the event: “I don’t race. But every year is a fun day of barbequeing, hanging out with friends, and just spending time outdoors. Kids run around, old friends catch up, it just a really fun day.”</p>

<p>Each contestant finished the race, with just a couple of seconds being the difference between many of the contestants. The race doesn’t end when a paddler reaches the sand, they must make it to the finish line up the beach with their boards, something Da Hui makes sure to remind everyone of each year.</p>

<p>“The whole concept of the race is having a good time and being in the ocean,&#8221; Mahina Chillingworth, race coordinator said.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;<a href="http://www.EqualityHawaii.org" target="_blank">Equality Hawaii</a>, the state&#8217;s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights organization, and the <a href="http://www.HRC.org" target="_blank">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC), the nation&#8217;s largest LGBT civil rights organization, congratulated the State House for concurring with the Senate on <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=546" target="_blank">House Bill 546, SD1</a>, a bill codifying prohibitions against discrimination in employment on the basis of gender identity, by a 45-4 vote with two absences. </p>

<p>The bill moves to Gov. Neil Abercrombie’s desk for his signature.</p>

<p>“Today is a great day for all residents of Hawaii,” said Alan Spector, Equality Hawaii co-chair.&nbsp; “Providing employment protections to transgender people in Hawaii is a victory for civil rights.&nbsp; The people of this state should be judged on the quality of work they do and not on who they are&#8212;that’s what this legislation guarantees.”</p>

<p>“The State of Hawaii is on a steady march to full equality for all its people,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “Being free from discrimination based on gender identity and expression, and to be judged on your merits and quality of work is a common-sense approach to employment policies. We congratulate the legislature for recognizing everyone should be treated equally in the workplace, and look forward to Gov. Abercrombie’s signature.”</p>

<p>The Human Rights Campaign and Equality Hawaii have worked closely together to build both public and legislative support for the bill. Through this joint effort, thousands of phone calls, emails, and handwritten letters have been sent to legislators urging them to approve this legislation. </p>

<p>Hawaii law already codified protections for transgender people in housing and public accommodations, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public accommodations. House Bill 546 extends protection to gender identity and expression in the workplace.</p>

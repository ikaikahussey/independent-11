<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;On the morning of Thursday, July 21, nearly 500 Local 5 members were joined by community, labor, and faith leaders to stage an early morning rally and bed-making skit on the sidewalk fronting the Hyatt Regency Waikiki.</p>

<p>Their actions were part of a nationwide effort across nine cities to call attention to housekeeping workload/safety and job security concerns. </p>

<p>Workers at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki officially launched their boycott of the Hyatt on June 17, 2011 and have been working without a new contract since June 30, 2010.</p>

<p>According to the workers, Hyatt has eliminated jobs, replaced career housekeepers with minimum wage temporary workers, and imposed dangerous workloads on those housekeepers who remain.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;National Night Out is Americaâ€™s night out against crime. In cities across the nation, neighbors, law enforcement officers, businesses, and community groups will come together to take a stand against crime. </p>

<p>Here in Honolulu more than 400 community volunteers will join with Honolulu Police officers and business partners to sign wave and celebrate continuing community efforts to fight crime. </p>

<p>National Night Out in Honolulu will take place on Tuesday, August 2 from 5:30 p.m. until 6:00 p.m. Volunteers will line Salt Lake Boulevard and wave signs promoting traffic safety, crime prevention, and drug avoidance.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Following the sign waving, the groups will move to the Target parking lot for a short program recognizing the work of the Neighborhood Security Watch groups. There will be entertainment, soft drinks, and snacks until 8:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Along with thanking the volunteers who work year round to prevent crime in their neighborhoods, National Night Out is a way to raise awareness for crime and drug prevention programs, generate support for neighborhood anti-crime programs, and strengthen police and community partnerships.</p>

<p>The public is invited to National Night Out.&nbsp; There will be educational material on crime prevention and information on starting a Neighborhood Security Watch program.</p>

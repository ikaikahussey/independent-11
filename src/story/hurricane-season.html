HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;You might think that summer is all about sunshine and great weather, but think twice. Summer is the season of hurricanes. From now till the end of November, the chances of these severe storms are big.</p>

<p>“Hurricanes” are mass storms that consist of wind speeds between 74mph and 155mph. They also produce heavy rains, floods, and possibly tornadoes. Two factors that contribute to the beginning stage of a hurricane are moisture and instability. Starting at the Tropic of Cancer, the center of the equator, moisture from the Earth is released into the air. Along with the instability of the atmosphere, when both factors are combined, a hurricane starts to form.</p>

<p>Depending on the temperature of the water, it can either increase or decrease the size of a hurricane.</p>

<p>“Hawaii’s east waters are cooler than the west waters,” said Hawaii County Civil Defense officer Bill Hanson. “Warmer waters tend to build up the hurricane while cooler waters slowly deconstructs it.”</p>

<p>Hawaii has seen first hand the destructive force of hurricanes&#8212;most notably with the arrival of Hurricane Iniki on September 11, 1992, which reached speeds up to 140 mph, resulting in billions of dollars in damage for residents on Kauai and Oahu. Many buildings, homes, and roads were wiped out in minutes due to the force of the storm.</p>

<p>This hurricane season has already seen two notable storms come and go, Celia and Darby, in the Pacific. Fortunately, the temperatures of the waters weakened Celia. Darby reached <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/sshws.shtml" title="category 3 strength">category 3 strength</a>, over 111 sustained mph winds.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important that Hawaii residents be aware of any storm watch or warning issued by the National Weather Service and are mindful of the procedures to take.</p>

<p>Hawaii County Civil Defense will announce a hurricane watch 48 hours prior to a storm reaching the island. A warning is then announced within 36 hours. Stay alert by listening to the radio, watching the news, or visiting the <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/index.shtml" title="National Weather Service website">National Weather Service website</a>.</p>

<p>In the event of a hurricane, follow these precautionary steps:</p>

<p>* Find safe evacuation routes.</p>

<p>* Locate your nearest local emergency shelter.</p>

<p>* Have a supply of water and non-perishable foods.</p>

<p>* Carry a battery-powered radio and flashlight, along with extra batteries.</p>

<p>* Always listen to the radio for any important storm watch.</p>

<p>* Have a first aid kit containing band-aids, antibacterial, and personal medication,</p>

<p>* Have a supply of blankets and sleeping bags.</p>

<p>* Carry personal identification.</p>

<p>* Keep any important documents (insurance policies).</p>

<p>* Carry cash or a credit card.</p>

<p>Hurricane season is now in effect; take action, be updated, and be safe!</p>

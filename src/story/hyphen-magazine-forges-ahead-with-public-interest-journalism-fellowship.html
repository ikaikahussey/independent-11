<p><i>Hyphen Magazine: Asian America Unabridged</i> is forging ahead with their first public-interest journalism fellowship, funds up to $3,500 for compelling projects about Asian Americans. </p>

<p>The project can be in any medium, so it&#8217;s open to print, web, audio, and visual journalists. The applications will be judged by an outside panel.</p>

<p>The Hyphen Public Interest Journalism Fellowship will foster high-impact stories about Asian Americans with a focus on coverage of the pressing social issues of the day, such as immigration or the environment.</p>

<p>Fellows will be selected based on the strength of the proposal and likelihood for successful reporting and completion. <i>Hyphen</i> publishes a print magazine, website, and blog.</p>

<p>The fellowship will fill a need for ambitious journalism covering Asian American communities and issues. Fellows will be expected to report and produce stories that illuminate some aspect of the Asian American experience. Fellows will be supervised by Hyphenâ€™s editorial team.</p>

<p><b>Eligibility:</b> Journalists who have at least three years of experience in print, video, audio or electronic journalism (writing, reporting, editing, producing) and demonstrate the ability to produce high-quality in-depth journalistic work. Applicants should have prior experience and a clear passion for covering Asian American communities and issues, or other marginalized communities and communities of color. Fellows must be eligible to work in the United States, though they do not need to be based in the United States. The candidate must represent and warrant that she or he be able to work in the United States or otherwise be able to receive the fellowship and perform the services required by the fellowship without violating applicable laws and regulations. Nothing stated herein shall obligate Hyphen magazine to awarding the fellowship or otherwise selecting a recipient for the fellowship. </p>

<p>The deadline to apply is August 1.</p>

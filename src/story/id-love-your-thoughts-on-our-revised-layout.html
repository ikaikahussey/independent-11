<p>Our server problems gave me an excuse to work on CSS and HTML this evening. I&#8217;d appreciate your feedback; my goals were to open things up a bit by taking out the background gray, and to de-emphasize our branding colors. &#8220;#991324&#8221; is a pretty intense color, and can easily conflict with photography or advertisements. Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>To celebrate the new year, The Independent is sponsoring <strong>The Ideas Summit</strong>, a half-day event bringing together top thinkers to explore fresh ideas for education, society, the environment, the economy, and our place in the world. Our goal is to raise perspectives that move our island community forward and make Hawaii better.</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;ll be able to join us! The Ideas Summit is January 18, 1-6 pm, with a hosted reception to follow. Get more info and <a href="http://ideassummit2013.eventbrite.com">purchase a ticket here</a>.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Good news for all you millionaires living in Hawaii. The Aloha State again has the greatest percentage of millionaires when compared to their overall population, according to the Phoenix Affluent Marketing Service&#8217;s annual ranking of millionaires per capita by state.</p>

<p>The report shows that approximately 6.9 percent of Hawaii&#8217;s households are millionaires, leading the nation for the third year in a row. Phoenix defines a millionaire household as one with $1 million or more in investable or liquid assets (excluding sponsored retirement plans and real estate). </p>

<p>Rounding out the top five states in millionaires per population are Maryland (6.8 percent), New Jersey (6.7 percent), and Connecticut (6.7 percent). These states have maintained their order of ranking since 2008.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is remarkable that the same four states have topped our millionaires ranking for three years running,&#8221; said David Thompson, managing director of the Phoenix Affluent Market. &#8220;However, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, and Connecticut all share some important distinctions: they are small states with large concentrations of highly educated professionals and business owners, which are key ingredients to growing wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Phoenix data also shows that, after two years of declines, the number of millionaires in the U.S. grew by 8 percent in 2010, numbering some 5.6 million households.</p>

<p>Here are some other sobering statistics not directly related to the millionaires report:</p>

<p>* The total number of bankruptcy filings in Hawaii increased 42.2 percent (or by 326) cases for the second quarter of 2010 from the same quarter of 2009, according to Hawaii&#8217;s Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism. This was the fourteenth consecutive quarter-over-quarter increase since the first quarter of 2007.</p>

<p>* In July, the unemployment rate was 6.8 percent with 43,350 people unemployed out of a labor force of 641,000 in the state.</p>

<p>* <a href="http://www.hawaiihomeproject.org/homelesshawaii.html" title="Statewide, up to 15,000 people are homeless at some point of the year">Statewide, up to 15,000 people are &#8220;homeless&#8221; at some point of the year</a>. At least 6,000 are &#8220;homeless&#8221; at any given day. Children make up between 23 and 39 percent of the &#8220;homeless.&#8221; Between 17 and 42 percent of Hawaii&#8217;s &#8220;homeless&#8221; are employed full-time. About 37 percent of the &#8220;homeless&#8221; are of Native Hawaiian ethnicity.</p>

<p>Discontent with the Abercrombie administration could be State Senator David Ige&#8217;s chance to catch up with Abercrombie&#8217;s campaign machine, Civil Beat analysis concludes. The results of the poll show &#8220;likely&#8221; democratic voters as evenly split and still largely &#8220;unsure&#8221; as to who they&#8217;ll vote for in the primary on August 9. However, in this article written by Chad Blair, it is pointed out that Ige has thus-far raised far less money than Abercrombie, who also beats Ige substantially in name recognition. </p>

<p>Expect to see the Ige campaign try to capitalize on this recent poll with renewed fundraising pushes to try and close the money gap.</p>

<p>Also of importance is a secondary set of numbers showing that Ige&#8217;s support comes largely from a lack of support for Abercrombie. In other words, it&#8217;s not so much that people support David Ige as a candidate as it is that people simply are disappointed in the governor. David Ige is still a fairly unknown name among the state&#8217;s voters, so it will be his task to weave a powerful enough biography and platform to turn lack of support for Abercrombie into real support for himself. Unfortunately for Ige, as chair of the Ways and Means committee, he&#8217;ll likely be very busy through the current legislative session.</p>

<p>However, Sen. Ige has secured powerful endorsements from ex-governors Ben Cayetano and George Ariyoshi, both considered former allies of Abercrombie, as well as from the Hawaii State Teachers Association (HSTA).</p>

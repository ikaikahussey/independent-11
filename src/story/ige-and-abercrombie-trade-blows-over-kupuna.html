<p>Gubernatorial candidate David Ige criticized incumbent Neil Abercrombie for backing out of three of four debates sponsored by AARP on Oahu, Maui and Hawaii Island in a press release sent out yesterday. The state senator said, &#8220;Citizens are losing important opportunities to compare the top two candidates for the state&#8217;s highest office in face-to-face meetings. Cancelling so late after arrangements have already been made by AARP and their members is disrespectful to our kupuna.&#8221;</p>

<p>The governor&#8217;s campaign cites scheduling conflicts as the reason for cancelling the three debates. Governor Abercrombie&#8217;s campaign manager Bill Kaneko sent a statement to the <em>Independent</em> in response to Senator Ige&#8217;s criticism:</p>

<blockquote><p>The two candidates will have more appearances together than any other opponents in a major race during this election cycle. Itâ€™s disappointing that our opponent seeks to make this an issue since he hurt kupuna by not advancing the Governor&#8217;s tax breaks for seniors this past session. At the end of the day, Gov. Abercrombie has fought hard to help Hawaii&#8217;s seniors, including increasing funding for Kupuna Care and the Executive Office on Aging, and proposing generous tax relief for needy seniors.</p>

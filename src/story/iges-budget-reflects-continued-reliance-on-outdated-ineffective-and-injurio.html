<p>“Keep public places public”—the governor&#8217;s new phrase for keeping the public out of public spaces, per his supplemental budget request. He&#8217;s asking for money to beef up security to crack down on the homeless at public locations.</p>

<p>Specifically, $419,302 for deputy sheriffs positions to “support homeless and illegal camping operations.” </p>

<p>To be fair, he&#8217;s also asking for $50 million for homelessness programs like Housing First and rapid rehousing and $75 million for the affordable housing revolving funds, which is great. But the perceived need for those extra sheriffs to force houseless people into shelters and other housing programs is a proven waste of taxpayer dollars and a contributing factor to our overcrowded jail and prison population.</p>

<p>Speaking of prison “highlights,” the governor wants $10 million for Department of Public Safety statewide facility master plans (they&#8217;ll be ADA accessible though, so, at least we can incarcerate the disabled without worrying about a lawsuit there), as well as an additional $33 million for new prison housing facilities and site assessments on each of the neighbor islands and and other $4.7 million for the department&#8217;s general administration and lump sum CIP.</p>

<p>Also, embedded in the capital improvement project budget, way down at the bottom, is $1 million for planning and assessment of public-private prison partnerships. Because making a profit off of incarcerated individuals has never, ever led to human rights-violating conflicts of interest.</p>

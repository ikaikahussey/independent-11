<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Each year, the Diamond Head Theatre parking transforms into an elegant oasis of fine dining, indulgence, and fun ... particularly for Oahu&#8217;s foodies. The Star Advertiser Ilima Awards, a benefit for the Diamond Head Theatre, happened on October 11. </p>

<p>The evening began with champagne, putting the crowd in a lighthearted and festive mood, ready to be entertained. At 6:30 p.m., everyone took their seats and the wackiness ensued. A pithy pastiche of classic tunes honored the restaurants who received awards, bringing laughter while tantalizing the patrons’ bellies with numerous allusions to the feast that awaited.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Luckily the one hour show proved to be true fun, or else the wait to dig into the dishes would have been excruciating. To get a sense of the entertainment, think Olivia Newton John’s <i>Magic</i> becoming “nothing to eat, and it’s tragic” or Sinatra’s <i>New York, New York </i>translated into an homage to pork.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a special treat, David Spangenthal did a fun riff on the current Diamond Head Theatre hit <i>Crazy for You</i>. Loretta Ables Sayre also made a surprise appearance on stage, having just returned from Broadway, where she starred in <i>South Pacific</i>. And the Shooting Stars tap dancer troupe wrapped things up with a spirited rendition of <i>I got Rhythm</i>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t a weak link in the show, and I was a bit sad to see it end. Luckily, the stage numbers were just an appetizer for the headliner: the marathon of eating that followed. </p>

<p>Twenty-five of the winning restaurants had plates to offer&#8212;most of the portions could be consumed in just one or two bites, meaning that you could sample several before getting full&#8212;in addition to 10 beverage stands offering everything from martinis, to Belgian beer, to wines of all varieties.</p>

<p>Highlights for me and my fellow dining companions included <b>The Pineapple Room</b>’s luscious pork belly topped with a delectable orange sauce that had a nice kick to it. Pork belly tends to be too rich to have has an entree, and it is such a disappointment when it is overcooked and dry. <b>Alan Wong</b>’s version lacked either problem. The bite size portion exploded with flavor and was super moist apart from its wonderfully crispy exterior. It warranted a second round, at the expense of some other dishes on offer.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Newcomer <b>KA Restaurant &amp; Lounge</b> also seduced tasters with its pork belly bao, making the reason for the “Chew pork, chew pork” performance earlier that evening abundantly apparent. It was the first thing I tasted, but proved to be one of the best dishes of the night.&nbsp; I may just have to make KA a date-night destination in the near future.</p>

<p>In terms of other things worth eating that were not swine-based, <b>Hiroshi’s Eurasian Tapas</b> featured a panko-crusted opah topped with Big Island tomato lomi, ume rice, and ginger miso brown butter.&nbsp; It was the perfect bite-sized morsel, and one of the first to disappear that evening; I felt lucky to grab one of the last ones.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>BLT Steak</b>’s unique take on a canape translated into a mini version of their signature popover filled with a tasty combination of Kahuku corn and steak. </p>

<p><b>Town</b> served up an array of bruscetta, topped with a wide range of ingredients, including my favorite&#8212;boquerones (basically a Spanish anchovy) and guacamole.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>3660</b> showed why it won for a second year in a row with a mini rendition of its famous ahi katsu, a dish that never disappoints. The sashimi-grade ahi is wrapped in nori, flash fried with the interior kept medium rare, and served with a wasabi-ginger sauce.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Maile’s Thai</b> noodles showed that even a simple, boring underachiever of a dish like pad thai can be stellar when executed with a deft hand.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Even the humble taco and beef brisket shined at <b>Tacos Ricos</b> and <b>Hog Island BBQ</b>, respectively, giving nice recognition to the many inexpensive yet delicious take-out eateries we have here. </p>

<p>In a similar vein, this year also honored the <b>KCC Farmers Market</b>, now a central fixture of our culinary landscape. Their booth was filled with beautiful produce, which was incorporated into a tasty eggplant crostini and a tomato and basil skewer.</p>

<p>Despite my good intentions, I failed to make it through the entire roster of offerings. For one, I started to get full. But the dance floor also beckoned to me and proved to distract me from the mission at hand (I can never resist a packed dance floor, particularly if it’s outside!). </p>

<p>Fueled by copious amounts of cocktails and wine, well-dressed revelers both young and old grooved to classic dance hits, just like at a good wedding. The Ilima Awards is the kind of evening you hate to see end, despite how satiated you are when you leave. I already look forward to next year’s celebration.</p>

<p><br />

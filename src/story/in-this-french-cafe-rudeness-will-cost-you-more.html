<p>From The Local, a blog offering news from France in English, about <a href="http://www.lapetitesyrah.fr">La Petite Syrah</a>, a café in Nice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A coffee” will set you back €7, according to the sign, while “a coffee please” is a little more affordable, at €4.25.</p>

<p>If you want keep your expenses down, and stay friends with your local barista, however, the best option is “Hello, a coffee please,” which will only cost you €1.40.</p>

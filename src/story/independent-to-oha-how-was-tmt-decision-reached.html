<p>After Office of Hawaiian Affairs trustee Bob Lindsey sent a <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/oha-trustee-explains-position-on-tmt">public statement</a> to the <em>Independent</em> regarding his role in convincing other trustees to <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/oha-backs-down-from-contesting-the-tmt-sublease">forfeit the state agency&#8217;s role as a plaintiff</a> in the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) contested case hearing, we sent a series of follow up questions regarding how that decision was made. We will post trustee Lindsey&#8217;s responses upon receiving them. The Board of Land and Natural Resources <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/blnr-rules-on-mauna-kea-telescope">voted to approve</a> the sublease between the University of Hawaii and the TMT Corporation, allowing the project to proceed pending the resolution of the contested case hearing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Was the issue of whether or not OHA should pursue its role as a plaintiff in the contested case hearing regarding the TMT sublease proposal discussed during the executive session that followed public testimony on July 15?</p>

<p>Was a decision to back-out of said contested case hearing made during said executive session?</p>

<p>What was the quorum present during said executive session? Who made the motion to go to decision making and who seconded? Is there a record of this process? Was it recorded in minutes and were those minutes approved at the subsequent board meeting on Kauai two days later?</p>

<p>If there was a vote taken on this issue during the executive session, did the board have quorum then?</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it true that decisions of this nature cannot be made during executive session, as such sessions are not exercises on public record?</p>

<p>If so, how can the OHA trustees have been said to have reached a decision on this matter?</p>

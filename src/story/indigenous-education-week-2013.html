<p>Over 160 Indigenous educators from the South Pacific, the Continental US and Hawaiʻi gathered at the Hawaiʻi Convention Center on Monday, April 29 2013 to celebrate THE POWER OF THE INDIGENOUS, which officially launched Indigenous Education Week 2013.&nbsp; This Indigneous Education Institute was co-sponsored by KU-A-KANAKA and the Native American Alliance for Charter Schools (NAACS) and hosted by the Center on Disability Studies, College of Education, University of Hawaiʻi.&nbsp; Colloquium topics centered around &#8220;Native Values informing Modern Instruction&#8221;, &#8220;Pedagogy of Place driving 21st Century Curriculum&#8221;, &#8220;Traditional Practices shaping Modern Assessment&#8221;, and &#8220;Local Communities imparting Global Skills.&#8221;&nbsp; <br />
In addition to providing practical advice on how to create and maintain quality Native-based public school options, the Institute focused on sharing Best Practices in Indigenous Education.&nbsp; These best practicces were clearly demonstrated when conference attendees visited two Honolulu-based Hawaiian-focused charters on Wednesday, as well as Maʻo Organic Farms and Youth Leadership Training site on Thursday. According to Dr. Kū Kahakalau, co-founder of KŪ-A-KANAKA, &#8220;Not just here in Hawaiʻi, but around the world, Native-based models of education are working.&nbsp; Moreover, when native children succeed, everyone will benefit.&#8221;</p>

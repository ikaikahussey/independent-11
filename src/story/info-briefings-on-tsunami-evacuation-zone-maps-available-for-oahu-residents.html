<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Emergency Management is offering four additional public information workshops to provide coastal communities around the island a preview of the new Tsunami Evacuation Zone Maps.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very important that everyone be aware of Tsunami Evacuation Zones and understand the appropriate precautions and responses that help protect public safety,&#8221; Acting Mayor Caldwell said. &#8220;These meetings provide great opportunities to learn more and to have any questions answered so that everyone may be fully prepared for an emergency.&#8221;</p>

<p>All four workshops are scheduled for this week:<br />
路&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Waikiki Elementary School &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Monday, July 26, 2010 at 5:30 p.m.<br />
路&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Brigham Young University Aloha Center &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Tuesday, July 27, 2010 at 5:30 p.m.<br />
路&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Koko Head District Park<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Wednesday, July 28, 2010 at 5:30 p.m.<br />
路&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Waimanalo District Park<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Thursday, July 29, 2010 at 5:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Each workshop is designed specifically for that particular community. </p>

<p>This is the first revision to the existing tsunami evacuation maps since 1991 and was accomplished using scientific techniques and technology not available at that time.</p>

<p>Representatives from the City&#8217;s Department of Emergency Management will present the new maps, discuss the implications for Oahu residents as well as answer questions. City and County first responders will also be present.</p>

<p>Visit the department&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.oahuDEM.org" title="www.oahuDEM.org">www.oahuDEM.org</a> to view draft copies of the new tsunami evacuation zone maps as well as a calendar of additional Oahu outreach workshops.</p>

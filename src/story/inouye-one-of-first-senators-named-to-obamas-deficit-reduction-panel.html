<p>Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye (D) and Max Baucus (D) of Montana will sit on a bipartisan negotiating team tasked with hammering out a plan to cut U.S. deficits, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said on Thursday. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/14/us-usa-budget-summit-idUSTRE73D8P520110414" target="_blank">Reuters reports</a>.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama called for the creation of the deficit reduction panel Wednesday, with the goal of having a plan prepared by July. The two Senate Democrats are the first legislators named to the deficit reduction panel, and they&#8217;ll be joined by House Democrats and Republicans from both chambers. <a href="http://www.greenwichtime.com/default/article/Inouye-named-to-deficit-reduction-panel-1338676.php" target="_blank">Associated Press reports</a>.</p>

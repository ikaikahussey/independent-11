<p>Chris Hamilton <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/530285.html?nav=10">reports</a> that Maui&#8217;s last remaining sugar business may soon be in the biofuel business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In my name, I promise HC&amp;S will not go under like the 16 other sugar cane operations,&#8221; [Senator] Inouye said. &#8220;If I am wrong, I will be out of a job.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

A decision was expected two weeks ago in the Na Wai Eha water case, and a new use for sugar lands could be the very excuse that Alexander &amp; Baldwin needs to keep its precious water rights. And the active involvement of Senator Daniel Inouye illustrates a historical fact, from its beginning to its end, sugar in Hawaii has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_Treaty_of_1875">government-supported</a>.</p>

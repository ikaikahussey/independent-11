<p>Honolulu will join 19 other member cities of the Mayors for Peace in celebrating the United Nations’ International Day of Peace by hosting the premier of a unique banner presentation of “Art Beyond Borders.”</p>

<p>The exhibition will be on display June 22 to 30 on the third floor of Honolulu Hale, as it begins its travels across the United States.</p>

<p>Similar to the passing of the Olympic Torch, each of the selected Mayors for Peace cities will host the exhibit for several days until it reaches the United Nations headquarters, where it will be on display in the Visitors’ Lobby. The UN International Day of Peace observance is on September 21.</p>

<p>“Art Beyond Borders” is a traveling exhibit that was assembled by The International Museum Of Twenty-first Century Arts. The goal was to create a collection of art that officially represents every country in the world in pursuit of cultural tolerance and appreciation. To date, more than 65 countries have agreed to participate. The banners in the exhibit will showcase works from 24 countries, including the United States, Austria, China, Egypt, Greece, Haiti, India, Iran, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mauritius, Monaco, Morocco, Nicaragua, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Vanuatu, Vatican City, and Zimbabwe.<br />
 <br />
In addition to Honolulu, the cities invited to participate are: Sacramento, Olympia, Carson City, Denver, Salt Lake City, Santa Fe, St. Paul, Austin, Des Moines, Little Rock, Madison, Atlanta, Concord, Providence, Montpelier, Boston, Washington, D.C.; Harrisburg, and Hartford.</p>

<p><i>Exhibit hours are 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Exhibit viewing is free and open to the public. For more information, call the Mayor&#8217;s Office of Culture and the Arts at (808) 768-6622.</i></p>

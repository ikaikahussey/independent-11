<p>It&#8217;s a pleasure to introduce some changes to the Independent.</p>

<p>First, we&#8217;ve moved to a dedicated virtual private server at Rackspace. You should see improved performance on our new server, which allows us to accommodate growing traffic.</p>

<p>Second, I&#8217;ve been watching with interest what our colleagues at the Boston Globe have been doing with web design. Led by the Filament Group and Ethan Marcotte, the Globe has unveiled a &#8216;responsive design.&#8217;&nbsp; What that means is that with a single codebase, bostonglobe.com responds automatically to various web browsers, window sizes, and devices.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve assiduously copied and mimicked the work of Ethan Marcotte and others, albeit with a humbler talent and skill set. Now, the Independent will adjust its layout automatically based on the browser window. And I&#8217;ve taken a &#8216;mobile first&#8217; approach, in which the primary code is optimized for a small mobile screen. Using media queries, then, the layout adjusts upwards for larger canvases.</p>

<p>So this technique is based squarely on wonderful web projects out there, like the HTML5 Boilerplate, the Less Framework, an others. </p>

<p>And like all things, this is a work in progress, and I welcome your feedback.&nbsp; Mahalo.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a pleasure to introduce <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/positives">Positives</a>, a new weekly feature dedicated to organizations that are working to improve Hawaii.</p>

<p>Peel back the veneer of paradise, and you&#8217;ll find a place with its share of problems, many of which are the stuff of news articles here in the Independent. But for every issue, there are passionate groups and individuals that are organizing and pushing for change. Over the next 52 weeks we&#8217;re featuring a cross-section of these initiatives. </p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to express a sincere thanks to our sponsor for Positives, the <a href="http://changenotcharity.org">Hawaii People&#8217;s Fund</a>. Now in their 40th year, they have provided the financial support that has undergirded some of Hawaii&#8217;s most important social, environmental, and community-based efforts. If you like what you read in Positives, please pay a visit to Hawaii People&#8217;s Fund and consider supporting their work. And the same goes for all of these great projects â€“ there are many opportunities for your kokua.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; <a href="http://www.iolanipalace.org/">Iolani Palace</a> will hold “Mai Poina”, a series of living history walking tours, beginning on Sunday, September 4 and continuing on Saturday and Sunday, September 10-11.</p>

<p>The series begins Sunday at the palace with the 5th annual Onipaa Celebration commemorating the birthday of Queen Liliuokalani. The <a href="http://www.rhb-music.com/" target="_blank">Royal Hawaiian Band</a> and the children of <a href="http://www.kawaihonapcs.org/joomla/" target="_blank">Ka Waihona O Ka Naauao</a> will perform, followed a performance of the play Ka Le Maile, a re-enactment of a meeting in Hilo that encouraged Hawaiian citizens to sign a petition against annexation by the United States. Other performers on Sunday include Walter Kawaiaea, who will share stories of the Queen’s mele.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Chanters perform mele written during this historic time in Hawaii history.&nbsp; Carefully gathered from books, newspaper articles and family collections, the mele encompass themes of adoration to the Queen, the unrest of the Hawaiian nationals, and other common themes surrounding the overthrow.</p>

<p>The walking tours that will take place are titled “Mai Poina” (“Don’t Forget’) and will feature costumed role-players interpreting the significant events and sites surrounding the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom through a dramatic narrative. After the tour, attendees are invited to join in a discussion about this pivotal episode in the history of our islands led by distinguished Native Hawaiian humanities scholars.</p>

<p>The event is cosponsored by the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/biograph/" target="_blank">UH Center for Biographical Research</a> and the <a href="http://hihumanities.org/" target="_blank">Hawaii Council for the Humanities</a>. The event, which will also feature demonstrations by  cultural practitioners, is free to the public. Reservations are encouraged.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Music Room at Iolani Palace has been fully restored to its original 19th Century splendor, and will be open to the public beginning today. It will be the first such “room reveal” at the palace in 20 years.</p>

<p>The cost of the restoration exceeded $250,000, much of which came from private donations. Many textile items such as the carpeting and drapery had to be completely recreated. Many other items have never been seen by the public before, including original watercolors and statuary.</p>

<p>Some of the notable items on display include the throne of Kamehameha III, a photo of Princess Kaiulani, and the Silver Yacht. The original pedestal for the yacht was lost during the overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani and was recreated by Martin &amp; MacArthur. A two-tusk table is of particular interest, as the two tusks that make the table had been separated for over 100 years. State Rep. Corrine Ching (R) was facilitated the return of one tusk from the continental United States.</p>

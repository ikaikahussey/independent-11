<p>Honolulu City Council District 4 (East Oahu) candidate Natalie Iwasa picked up two important endorsements on Tuesday from the Honolulu Star-Advertiser and from the Sierra Club of Hawaii. The Star-Advertiser noted Iwasa’s involvement with many civic and environmental groups, as well as her constant presence at the Council’s full sessions over the past four years.</p>

<p>“As a certified public accountant, her testimony is constructive—in 2009 she analyzed plans for new lighting along Lunalilo Home Road and persuaded the Council to revamp the project, saving the city money upfront and through the years via lower electricity costs,” said the Star-Advertiser.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday’s endorsement letter from the Sierra Club of Hawaii stated that her “demonstrated commitment” to protecting Hawaii’s environment for future generations was the reason they have chosen to support her campaign. Iwasa is the current chair of the Planning and Zoning Committee for the Hawaii Kai Neighborhood Board. She is also a member of Livable Hawaii Kai Hui, a nonprofit that promotes the sustainability of East Honolulu communities, and is the co-founder and president of Cycle On Hawaii, a nonprofit that aims to make Oahu roads bicycle-friendly.</p>

<p>“I am truly honored to have received endorsements from such respected organizations that represent the views of such a large number of District 4 constituents,” Iwasa said. “I believe I can bring a renewed focus on fiscal accountability, government transparency, and maintaining essential programs without raising taxes.”</p>

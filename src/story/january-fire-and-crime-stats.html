2)&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Fire Safety Tip&#8212;Smoke Alarms&#8212;Smoke alarms save lives and are an important part of a home fire escape plan. Install smoke alarms in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every level of a home. Test smoke alarms monthly and replace batteries yearly. Practice a home fire escape plan and designate a safe meeting place outside the home. Many lives could be saved if all homes contained working smoke alarms.<br />

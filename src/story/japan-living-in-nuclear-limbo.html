<p>The coastal town of Minamisoma in Fukushima prefecture lost 1,470 of its residents to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami; five weeks on, what remains of the population is living in a state of nuclear limbo. Within days of the start of the nuclear crisis Minamisomaâ€™s population of just over 70,000 had fallen to just 10,000, as fleets of buses took petrified residents to evacuation centers hundreds of miles away. <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/japan/110416/japan-tsunami-fukushima-nuclear-meltdown" target="_blank">Global Post reports</a>.</p>

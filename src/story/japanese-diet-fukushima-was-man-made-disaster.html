"teaser":"Hiroko Tabuchi, reporting for the New York Times:  <blockquote> The report, released by the Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission, challenged some of the main story lines that the government and the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant have put forward. Most notably, the report said the plant’s crucial cooling systems might have been damaged in the earthquake on March 11, 2011, not only in the ensuing tsunami. That possibility raises doubts about the safety of all the quake-prone country’s nuclear plants just as they begin to restart after a pause ordered in the wake of the Fukushima crisis. </blockquote>  The full report is available <a href=\"http://naiic.go.jp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/NAIIC_report_lo_res.pdf\">here</a> (PDF).",

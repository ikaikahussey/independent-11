<p>Monday morning UH athletic director Jim Donovan announced that he was relieving Bob Nash after his three years as head coach for the Rainbow Warriors basketball program. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe Bob Nash ever leaving the program&#8212;or at least so soon. Nash, the program&#8217;s eighteenth head coach, has been involved with the Rainbow Warriors for 31 years. The decision came after the mens team ended their season with a 10-20 record, losing to Boise State and Idaho on the road to give them a last place finish in the WAC, dropping the team&#8217;s chances of playing in the WAC tournament. The 10-win 2010 season marked the third straight year that the team would end the season with a losing record. If UH had finished the season with 18 wins, it would of have given Nash another year added to his contract.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;Ultimately this comes to a business decision based on win-loss record, not Bob Nash&#8217;s character, or how well he performed in other aspects of the program,&#8221; said Donovan during the Monday press conference announcing the firing of Nash. &#8220;We are grateful for the way he represented the school and for the example he has set for our student athletes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash started at UH during his two-year stay on the team, being part of the &#8220;Fabulous Five&#8221; that helped lead the Rainbows to its first NIT and NCAA tournaments and winning numerous all-American honors. After his playing career at UH, Nash played for the Detroit Pistons for two years and played professionally several years after that overseas and back again in the United States. Nash made his return to UH to as a graduate assistant in 1984, then as assistant and associate coach under from head coach Riley Wallace for 20 years before accepting the head coach position as Wallace retired. </p>

<p>&#8220;Actually Bob Nash was doing us in Hawaii a favor when he signed up to work for only $240,000. He did well for what was given to him,&#8221; said one blogger in response to Nash&#8217;s firing. &#8220;They even hired him late in the season so he couldn&#8217;t recruit in time, so don&#8217;t put all the blame on him. We messed up too by dragging our feet in hiring him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nash had one year remaining on his contract, but the school will buy out his remaining year. Athletic Director Donovan said there have been outside donors offering to help pay for part of his buyout. The athletic department has already begun the search for a replacement as he hopes to have a new head coach selected in a few weeks, as the national letter of intent day for high school players is April 14. </p>

<p>Upon relieving Nash of his head coaching duties, Donavan offered him a job with Athletic department involving the fundraising for the expansion and refurbishment of the Stan Sheriff Arena. However, Nash refused the position. </p>

<p>&#8220;He may no longer be our coach, but he will forever be a Rainbow Warrior,&#8221; said Donovan.</p>

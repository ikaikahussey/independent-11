<p>HONOLULU&#8212;It&#8217;s 9:00 a.m. at JJ Dolan&#8217;s on a First Friday in Chinatown, and there is a palpable, calm-before-the-storm feeling as co-owner Danny Dolan discusses his establishment&#8217;s one-year anniversary. In tough economic times, the story of the success that he and business partner Jay Niebuhr are enjoying is particularly resonant.</p>

<p>Dolan and Niebuhr have been in the bar/restaurant industry for decades. This is a fact that belies their youthful exuberance and blatant optimism about opening a restaurant. But salient business advice and a sound sense of community have afforded JJ Dolan&#8217;s the ability, and the opportunity, to prosper. Lauded in the press and loved by the people, theirs is an operation worthy of the praise it&#8217;s received.</p>

<p>Dolan worked behind the rail at legendary Anna Bannna&#8217;s for many years, and Niebuhr was a part of the crack staff at Murphy&#8217;s Bar &amp; Grill long enough to understand the importance of quality product and service. </p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to recognize what does and doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; says Dolan, affable and candid. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be able to provide good value to your customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although humbly reluctant to accept the mantle of mentor, Murphy&#8217;s Bar &amp; Grill owner Don Murphy speaks proudly. </p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done everything right,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They hit the nail right on the head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar managers Wayne Larrow and Patrick Oliver are first among &#8220;A-list&#8221; bartenders in Honolulu, and they work tirelessly to make JJ Dolan&#8217;s an island institution. </p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got good people,&#8221; says Dolan. &#8220;We just get out of their way and let them do what they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolan&#8217;s humility is indicative of his awareness and gratitude of the support he and Niebuhr have received. </p>

<p>&#8220;We owed a lot of people a lot of beer and pizza when we opened our doors,&#8221; says Dolan, only half-joking.</p>

<p>When pressed about what was the biggest challenge in opening a restaurant, Dolan laughs. </p>

<p>&#8220;Getting to where we could open the doors,&#8221; he says. </p>

<p>The chairs at JJ Dolan&#8217;s are fashioned from recycled gymnasium wood donated by folks at the University of Hawaii. The gleaming brass shining along Dolan&#8217;s walkways was similarly bequeathed. From casual advice to actual building materials, JJ Dolan&#8217;s success is the result of a whole lot of belief and goodwill. </p>

<p>Dolan and Niebuhr seem to understand clearly the importance of being a part of a community. Donating generously to organizations like Meals on Wheels, United Cerebral Palsy, the National Federation of the Blind, and the American Heart Association, Nieburh and Dolan are reciprocating the support they&#8217;ve received. </p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been a charity we&#8217;ve turned down,&#8221; shrugs Dolan.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A lunchtime crowd files into the door as order bells ring and Bruddah Iz croons from the sound system. Danny Dolan beams as he pours a Guiness, somehow surprised by the crowd. </p>

<p>&#8220;It is what it is,&#8221; he laughs.</p>

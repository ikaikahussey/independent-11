<p>DOWNTOWN &#8212; Friends and family are mourning the passing of John Ferguson, a longtime Honolulu publican and native  of Ballyshannon, Ireland last week. Ferguson owned Ferguson’s Irish Pub on Bishop Street, which he opened over ten years ago. A bartender at many of Honolulu’s most memorable establishments, “Fergie” worked for many years at Murphy’s Bar and Grill before opening his own genuine Irish pub.</p>

<p>John Ferguson had many friends in the Downtown business community, and all will likely remember him for being a true Irish gentleman and a consummate host. He gave generously to Irish groups on Oahu, and welcomed countless pub-crawls and celebrations for his patrons. The small bar in the Dillingham Transportation Building was often filled with friends celebrating birthdays, retirements, and all manner of occasions, with Fergie behind the bar, smiling always.</p>

<p>Services for John “Fergie” Ferguson are pending.</p>

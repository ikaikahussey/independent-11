<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The University of Hawaii at Manoa&#8217;s historic Johnson Hall reopens Monday to student residents after a $6.7 million, year-long renovation project. </p>

<p>Major improvements were made to all 98 double rooms, lounges, and offices. Modern safety devices were also installed.</p>

<p>As UH Manoa&#8217;s oldest residence facilities, Johnson Halls A and B were constructed in 1958 and 1962 at a cost of $897,000. With its reopening, the majority of the nearly 4,000 Manoa campus housing units are either new or newly renovated. UH Manoa is currently housing a record-high number of students on campus.</p>

<p>As part of Manoa Move-In 2011, students will be moving into the newly refurbished Johnson Halls Monday from 10:00 a.m. through 2:00 p.m.</p>

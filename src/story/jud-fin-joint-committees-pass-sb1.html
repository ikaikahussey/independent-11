<p>The joint House committee hearing on SB1 (between the Judiciary and Finance committees) resulted in a recommendation to pass SB1 back to the full house, but with three primary amendments.</p>

<p>The religious exemption language was strengthened to match the language in Connecticut&#8217;s <a href="http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2009/04/connecticut-law-implements-same-sex.html">same-sex marriage law</a>. The parental provision clause (572C) was removed as it was deemed &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; and the date on which the law would take effect was pushed back to December 2..</p>

<p>The bill will now go back before the full House, with a vote scheduled for <del>Thursday</del> Wednesday, with the third reading likely scheduled for Friday.</p>

<p><em>Updated with vote information.</em></p>

<p>The committee vote was 10 ayes (Representatives Luke, Nishimoto, Hashem, Ing, Kobayashi, Lowen, Morikawa, Onishi, Takayama and Yamashita) and 7 noes (Representatives Johanson, Cullen, Jordan, Tokioka, Woodson and Fukumoto and Ward).</p>

<p><em>Updated 9:55 a.m., 11/6/2013.</em></p>

<p>Governor Abercrombie&#8217;s administration sent out a press release last night endorsing the amendments:</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL <br />
DAVID LOUIE<br />
ATTORNEY GENERAL </p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE <br />
Nov. 5, 2013 <br />
Governor and Attorney General Statement on Amendments to SB 1 – Relating to Equal Rights </p>

<p>HONOLULU — Gov. Neil Abercrombie and State Attorney General David Louie released the following statement regarding amendments to Senate Bill 1 – Relating to Equal Rights. </p>

<p>“The amendments outlined in House Draft 1 strike a balance between the bill that was introduced by the Legislature and concerns raised in written and oral testimony during public hearings. </p>

<p>“We support the principle that any measure on marriage equity must protect religious freedom, which the Legislature has clearly worked to achieve. </p>

<p>“The bill as amended is legally sound and is in accord with the Hawaii State Constitution. </p>

<p>“We urge the Legislature to pass this bill, which will provide marriage equity and fully recognize religious beliefs in that context.”</p>

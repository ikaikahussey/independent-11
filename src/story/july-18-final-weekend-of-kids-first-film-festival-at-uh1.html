<p>The KIDS FIRST! Film Festival finishes its final Sunday on July 18 from 3:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. at the University of Hawaii Manoa&#8217;s Art Building Auditorium. The award-winning festival returns this year with four summer Sundays of free family films.</p>

<p>KIDS FIRST!, a project of the Coalition for Quality Children&#8217;s Media, is the largest traveling children&#8217;s film festival in the world.</p>

<p>Curated locally by UH Manoa&#8217;s Outreach College, KIDS FIRST! films are free of gratuitous violence; race, gender, or religious bias; inappropriate content; and condescension towards children.</p>

<p>Age-appropriate groupings of films entertain through a balance of animation and live action, plus varied themes from different cultures.</p>

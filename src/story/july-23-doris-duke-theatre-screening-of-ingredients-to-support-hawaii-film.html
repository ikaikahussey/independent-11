<p>Whole Foods Market Kahala and Doris Duke Theatre have teamed up to present the documentary <i>Ingredients</i> at the Honolulu Academy of Arts on Friday, July 23.</p>

<p>The event aims to build awareness of Whole Foods Market’s Community Support Day being held Saturday, July 24. Whole Foods Kahala will donate 5 percent of that day’s proceeds to the production of the movie <i>Ingredients Hawaii</i>, which will highlight leaders in Hawaii’s growing local-food movement, in hopes of inspiring island residents to find out where their food comes from, source locally, and even grow some of their own food.</p>

<p><i>Ingredients Hawaii</i> is director Robert Bates’ local follow up to his 2009 film <i>Ingredients</i>, which focuses on the people behind the United States’ local-food movement and their mission to bring good food back to the table and health back to communities.</p>

<p>Directed by part-time Hawaii resident Bates, and narrated by Bebe Neuwirth, <i>Ingredients</i> criss-crosses the country, from Portland to New York City, over the course of four growing seasons. Bates takes viewers from the diversified farms of the Hudson River and Willamette Valleys to the urban food outposts of Harlem, and to the kitchens of celebrated chefs such as Alice Waters, Peter Hoffman, and Greg Higgins.</p>

<p>The screening will be preceded by a reception at 3:30 p.m. Visitors can enjoy light refreshments and meet the director. The film will be shown at 4 p.m., and will be followed by a panel discussion with Bates, Claire Sullivan of Whole Foods Market Hawaii, and food writer Martha Cheng. </p>

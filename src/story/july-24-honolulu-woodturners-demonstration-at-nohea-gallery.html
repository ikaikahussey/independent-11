<p>This summer marks Nohea Gallery&#8217;s 20th anniversary sharing local artists work with the community. This Saturday, July 24 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., members of the Honolulu Woodturners will be demonstrating the art of making wooden bowls. </p>

<p>Collectors of fine woodworking look forward to this outstanding group show all year. Turned woodwork from the Honolulu Woodturners club, a wonderful group of men and women dedicated to the craft, is available in a fantastic assortment. The turners make useful and beautiful art, turning recycled trees into treasures.</p>

<p>Eighteen woodturners&#8217; work is on view and available for sale in beautiful local woods such as koa, norfolk pine, milo, mango, and kamani. Most of the work are bowls in either traditional Hawaiian or contemporary shapes, as well as handtools and vases. </p>

<p>All proceeds from selected bowls will go to the Hawaii Foodbank. </p>

<p>Saturday&#8217;s demonstration is free and open to the public. The woodworking show runs through August 16.</p>

<p>KAUPA will be holding a community meeting to gain insight for the content of the planned 250-ft wall mural along the streambank at Kalihi Waena on Friday, July 9 from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. at Kalihi Waena Elementary School Cafeteria, 1240 Gulick Avenue.</p>

<p>Channeled through the empowerment and development of Kalihi&#8217;s young adult alakai, KAUPA wants to hear your voice, see your stories visually translated, and feel your ideals or symbols which represent the heart of the community. These will all take on a new life as the past, present, and future of Kalihi is documented in the mural. </p>

<p>For those who are unable to attend the meeting, KAUPA is asking the community to also take an online survey <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6GJCWQM" title="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6GJCWQM">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6GJCWQM</a> to help with the idea generating process. Participants will receive a free KAUPA reusable bag for taking the survey.</p>

<p>The aim of the mural project is to visually represent the cultural, environmental, social, and political issues and stories of the community. Local artists Meleanna Meyer, Prime of 808 Urban, Solomon Enos, and Kahi Ching will be working with Kalihi&#8217;s own alakai to complete this first mural of many along the stream.</p>

<p><i>KAUPA is still seeking monetary and in-kind donations of paint, painting supplies, and refreshments to fully support this project. To make a donation or for more information, contact Marissa Abadir at kaupa2create@yahoo.com or (808) 343-0240.</i></p>

<p>The Korean production JUMP! brings a mix of martial arts acrobatics and slapstick comedy to Hawaii Theatre for a performance run from Tuesday, April 5 through Sunday, April 17. The show has sold out houses from Broadway to Hong Kong, thrilling audiences without special effects, wires or a net.</p>

<p>Set in a traditional Korean home, JUMP! plays off of the relationships between a strict patriarch and his three-generational family, which includes a love-struck granddaughter and a drunken uncle. Combining astonishing gymnastics and cheeky slapstick, the show provides wows and laughs for the whole family. It is brought to Honolulu by Tim Bostock Productions and Hawaiian Air, promoting the airlineâ€™s direct flight to Seoul.&nbsp;  </p>

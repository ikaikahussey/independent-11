<p>HONOLULU&#8212;<a href="http://gomurphys.com" title="Murphy’s Bar &amp; Grill">Murphy’s Bar &amp; Grill</a> at Nuuanu Avenue and Merchant Street is catching USA Soccer fever by opening early on Saturday, June 12, for the U.S. team’s first 2010 FIFA World Cup match against England. The doors at Murphy’s will open at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, with the match between the USA and England starting at 8:30 a.m. </p>

<p>A full breakfast buffet with corned beef hash, English bangers, and a variety of other appropriate comestibles will be served and beer specials will be available. </p>

<p>Owner Don Murphy has arranged for free parking for guests in the lot at the makai end of Nuuanu Avenue. Admission is $10 per person and includes the breakfast buffet.</p>

<p>Worldwide viewership statistics for the FIFA World Cup have been a point of debate for some time, but it is certainly safe to say that it is, with the Olympics, the largest spectacle of sport in the world. While most rabid supporters hail from outside the United States, soccer’s popularity has grown in recent years with the international success of the U.S. team and the nascent popularity of Major League Soccer.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, Murphy’s has a draw of its own, regardless of what’s on the many televisions on the walls there. But Murphy&#8217;s does seem the likely headquarters for Oahu soccer fans on Saturday.</p>

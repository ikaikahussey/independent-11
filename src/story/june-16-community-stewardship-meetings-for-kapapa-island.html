<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) is holding informal community stewardship meetings for Kapapa Island, located in Kaneohe Bay. The next meeting is scheduled at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, June 16, at Windward Community College, Hale ‘Akohekohe, room 105.</p>

<p>Kapapa Island is now protected by rule as a wildlife sanctuary, like a number of other offshore islets of Hawaii.These islets support some of the most sensitive wildlife habitats, and offer refuge for the unique biological and cultural resources of our state.</p>

<p>DOFAW is holding the meetings to give the community an opportunity to collaborate on planning the future management of the islet. Anyone who has an interest in Kapapa islet, or relevant expertise, is invited to participate. Contact DOFAW at (808) 973-9786 for meeting materials.</p>

<p>Kapapa’s important wildlife resources have been officially protected since 1917 when the Territorial Governor designated the islet for protection under the Revised Laws of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Kapapa was later set aside as a wildlife reservation by Executive Order in 1932, and became protected under Regulation 7. However, in 1981, during a process to replace Regulation 7 with Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 13-125, after public input, Kapapa Islet was omitted from the list of protected sanctuaries, removing all regulatory and enforcement capability.</p>

<p>As the population of Oahu grows, so do the human impacts to the islet, its wildlife, and its coastal habitat. Every year native seabirds are found dead on Kapapa as a result of dog attacks, trampling of nesting burrows, and entanglement in discarded fishing gear. Seabird nesting habitat, formerly dominated by native plants, is currently overgrown by invasive species.</p>

<p>Cultural burial sites and a heiau have been, and continue to be littered with trash and human waste. Even a residential encampment was established on the island.</p>

<p>DOFAW&#8217;S priority for Kapapa remains resource management and protection, However, recognizing its value for other uses, DOFAW has stated that it is open to recreational use of the islet within established guidelines and responsible stewardship. DOFAW said it also recognizes the strong community ties to Kapapa, and the importance of community-based stewardship.</p>

<p>Help DOFAW to protect the nesting seabirds, and other natural and cultural resources on the islet by observing the sanctuary rules. Do not take dogs to the islet, do not go into the interior of the islet, stay around the perimeter, no overnight activities, and remove any trash you may take onto or find on the islet.</p>

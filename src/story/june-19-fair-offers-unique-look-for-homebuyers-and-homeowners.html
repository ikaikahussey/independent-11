<p>The City and County of Honolulu and Oahu’s homeownership partners invite prospective homebuyers and homeowners to the 7th Annual Homebuyer/Homeowner Fair. The event is free and open to the public and will be held on Saturday, June 19 from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at Kapolei Hale, 1000 Uluohia Street.</p>

<p>Despite Hawaii’s high cost of living, the state has continually been among the lowest in the nation regarding foreclosures. To date, 237 families have taken advantage of the City’s services to buy homes. Additionally, 30 families from the City’s Section 8 Rental Assistance Housing Program have become homeowners.<br />
 <br />
As in previous fairs, a wide array of home-buyer resources will be available, including financial literacy workshops, home-buyer tips, credit repair, and non-profit agencies that can help with buying strategies. Loan officers will be available to provide loan information and pull credit reports. Families that may be struggling with high mortgage payments can attend foreclosure counseling workshops that provide support, resources, and guidance to avoid foreclosures.</p>

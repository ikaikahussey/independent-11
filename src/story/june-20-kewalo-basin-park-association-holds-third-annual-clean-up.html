<p>The Friends of Kewalo Basin Park Association are back to rally  community members to get out their green thumbs for the Third Annual Park Clean-up.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 20, community volunteers are encouraged to bring water, rakes, and other garden tools and spend a day together under the sun. Bags will be provided.</p>

<p>Be sure to wear sunscreen, shoes, hat, and gloves and sport a &#8220;Friends&#8221; T-shirt while supply lasts.</p>

<p>The clean-up will be followed by lunch (bring a potluck dish if you can), entertainment, prize giveaways and a general membership meeting for The Friends of Kewalo Basin Park Association to inform everyone about what&#8217;s going on in and around Kewalo Basin Park.</p>

<p>The Friends of Kewalo Basin Park Association is a grassroots organization made up of surfers, fishremen and women, divers, swimmers, walkers, joggers and general park users formed in 2005. Their mission is to protect Kewalo Basin park and its surrounding areas and waters to ensure all recreational users will continue to have access and the ability to enjoy the park.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The State Commission on Water Resource Management will hold a public hearing at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday, June 23, to receive public testimony on the Waianae and Koolauloa watershed management plans. The hearing will be in board room 132 of the Kalanimoku state office building at 1151 Punchbowl Street.</p>

<p>The watershed management plans were prepared by the Honolulu Board of Water Supply in collaboration with the City and County of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting, to guide the long-range development and conservation of resources in the Waianae and Koolauloa districts, and include strategies to protect and enhance the health of the regional watersheds.</p>

<p>“These plans will provide valuable guidance to the Water Commission as it strives to balance the water needs of humans and the environment, while seeking to ensure the sustainability of natural resources,” said Deputy Director Ken Kawahara.</p>

<p>The plans are two of eight regional plans that together will comprise the updated water use and development plan for the City and County of Honolulu, which is a component of the Hawaii Water Plan.</p>

<p>Copies of the Watershed Management Plans are available on the Water Commission’s website at <a href="http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/cwrm/planning_countyplans.htm" title="http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/cwrm/planning_countyplans.htm">http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/cwrm/planning_countyplans.htm</a>. The plans may also be reviewed at the Water Commission’s office at the Kalanimoku Building, 1151 Punchbowl Street, Room 227.</p>

<p>Persons unable to attend or wishing to present additional comments may mail written testimony no later than July 9, 2010 to: Commission on Water Resource Management, 1151 Punchbowl Street, Room 227, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813, or send comments via e-mail at dlnr.cwrm@hawaii.gov.</p>

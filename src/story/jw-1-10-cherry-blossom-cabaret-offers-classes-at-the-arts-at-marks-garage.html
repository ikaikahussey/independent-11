<p>Honolulu&#8217;s premiere Burlesque troop CherryBlossom Cabaret (CBC) has enjoyed a still-growing popular support and interest since its inception in 2006. Having developed a fruitful working relationship with many Chinatown hot spots, their exposure (pun intended) has earned them fans as well as students in their Academy of Tease at Arts at Marks Garage.</p>

<p>CBC is launching a 5-week Academy of Tease course teaching the basics of Burlesque, beginning Tuesday, January 11 at Arts at Marks Garage, 1159 Nuuanu Ave. CBC also offers an ongoing Pilates and Brazilian samba class beginning on Thursday, January 13. Pilates is taught by certified instructor Madame X, and the samba portion is taught by CBC Director Lola Love. </p>

<p>Apart from invaluable inner rewards of self esteem and confidence, all of the classes help improve balance, grace, and overall fitness. The Tuesday Burlesque class is limited to those aged 18-and-over, but the Thursday Pilates/Brazilian samba class is open to all ages.</p>

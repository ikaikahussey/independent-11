<p>A fundraiser for the Hawaii Lifeguards Association Junior Lifeguard Program happens at Hawaiian Brian’s on Saturday, January 15. Two legendary performers, Maria Muldaur and Dan Hicks, are set to perform. </p>

<p>Muldaur gained national recognition as a singer in the legendary New York City folk music scene of the early 1960s, working with Bob Dylan among many others. She scored an international hit with “Midnight at the Oasis” in 1974, which peaked at #6 on the Billboard charts.</p>

<p>Also performing that night will be the “King of Cowboy Jazz” Dan Hicks. His career began in 1965 in the San Francisco folk scene, where he enjoyed acclaim due to witty songwriting in songs like “How Can I Miss You When You Won’t Go Away?” His 2000 comeback release <i>Beatin’ the Heat</i> featured musical legends like Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bette Midler, and Brian Setzer.</p>

<p>The pair stop in Honolulu as part of a four-island tour that begins Thursday on Kauai. </p>

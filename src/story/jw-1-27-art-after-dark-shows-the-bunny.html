<p>The Honolulu Academy of Arts celebrates the Chinese Year of the Rabbit with its first Art After Dark event of 2011, Show Me the Bunny. Booming drums and lion dance will summon good luck for the new year at 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., with NYC DJ Roxy Cottontail providing the electronic <i>chi</i>.</p>

<p>Zen artist Andy Lee will create pop culture pieces using traditional calligraphy techniques. The first floor galleries at the Academy will be open, so attendees will have the chance to see several exhibits that will end in February.</p>

<p>The restaurants Town and Downtown will be on hand to provide food and beverage sponsorship and a variety of Chinese comestibles will be presented, including the monk staple jai. Those who get their fortune told will have the chance to win a variety of prizes from the Academy.</p>

<p>There are several options for free parking nearby, and Kim Chee III Restaurant offers parking for $5.</p>

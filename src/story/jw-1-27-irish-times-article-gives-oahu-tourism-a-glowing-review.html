<p><br />
Oahu was featured as a “fascinating” destination <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/travel/2011/0122/1224288038693.html">in a travel article for the January 22 issue</a> of the <i>Irish Times</i>, published in Dublin, Ireland for a national readership. The lengthy article’s author, Molly McCloskey, provides a fairly comprehensive overview of Oahu’s major attractions, such as Iolani Palace, Hanauma Bay, Pearl Harbor, and the Bishop Museum.</p>

<p>After providing a brief, post colonial history of the island, McCloskey’s article covers most of Oahu, and mentions a handful of popular small businesses. Some of these include Ono Hawaiian Foods, Gone Surfing Hawaii, Bailey’s Antiques, and North Shore Marketplace. All in all, the <i>Irish Times</i> article on visiting Oahu is a ringing endorsement for readers in Ireland and online and may even help bolster resurgent Oahu tourism.</p>

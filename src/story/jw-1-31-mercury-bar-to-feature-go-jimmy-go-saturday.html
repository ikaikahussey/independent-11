<p>First Fridays in Chinatown have become an important monthly boon to dozens of galleries, restaurants, and bars in the area. Even the nice lady at the C-Mui Center on Bethel sees her sales of crack seed spike reliably and significantly once per month. However, all of the activity on first Friday means a slower-than-usual Saturday the next night, as anyone who works in Chinatown on &#8220;First Saturday&#8221; might surely agree.</p>

<p>Mercury Bar on Chaplain Lane rails against that regular dip in business with its “F*ck First Friday” series on Saturday, this time bringing in rocksteady heavyweights Go Jimmy Go and a handful of veteran ska and punk rock bands, including 86 List and False Crack. DJ Jet Boy and Selector Nomad will be on hand to spin between bands. </p>

<p>The intent of &#8220;F*ck First Friday&#8221; is to thumb one&#8217;s nose at the trendy, once-a-month exercise that First Friday has become, and to support the musicians and artists that make their living in Chinatown every day.</p>

<p>The event is free, although donations for the performers are encouraged.</p>

<p><b>F*ck First Friday<br />
Saturday, February 5 at 9:00 p.m.<br />
Mercury Bar<br />
1154 Fort Street Mall (on Chaplain Lane)</b></p>

<p>KALIHI&#8212;In addition to regular board agenda items discussed at December&#8217;s Liliha/Puunui/Alewa/Kamehameha Heights Neighborhood Board meeting was the current disposition of the Hale Kakoo Alzheimer’s Respite Center. State Representatives Keith Ishida and Rosanne Eves reported to the board that the care center is still in the process of resolving pertinent licensing issues. (Other business discussed included 2 vacancies on the board.)</p>

<p>The Center is currently seeking a license to operate both night and day services. Hale Kakoo reported that inspections from the City Department of Community Services have not noted anything negative about the facility. The Department of Human Services is handling Hale Kakoo’s licensing application.</p>

<p>The facility, which will service only 12 patients at a time, will not operate 24 hours, but has the ability to coordinate with other facilities to provide services when Hale Kakoo is not open. Cost of services was stated at $60 per day and $100 for night service.</p>

<p>Hale Kakoo’s lease will be submitted to the City Council in January 2011, and an open house has been scheduled for Friday, January 7.</p>

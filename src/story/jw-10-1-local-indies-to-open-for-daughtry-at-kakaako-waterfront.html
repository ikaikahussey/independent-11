<p>Two of Honolulu’s most ascendent indie outfits are a slated to open for national alt-rock darlings <b>Daughtry</b> at Kakaako Waterfront on Friday. Daughtry is named for the frontman that made it to the American Idol Season Five finals in 2006.</p>

<p><b>Kings of Spade</b> and <b><a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/musician-tavana-mcmoore-is-an-electrixc-monkey/" title="Tavana">Tavana</a></b> won’t likely be appearing on that televised, soul-sucking circus, but a chance to open for a mainstream act can be a boon for even the most committed independent artist. Tavana’s blues rock and Kings of Spade’s rock/funk/hip hop fusion are likely to get the crowd as pumped as Daughtry will. We’ll be rooting for the hometown heroes.</p>

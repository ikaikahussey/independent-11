<p>The Hawaii Bar Owners Association will host a feast for the sense with &#8220;Scotch, Steaks, and Stogies&#8221; on Wednesday, October 20 at the Celtic Cultural Center behind O’Toole’s Irish Pub. The event will feature a selection of six fine scotches, including Singleton and Lagavulin. Certified Master of Whiskey Thomas Turner will be on hand to discuss the finer points and subtleties of each premium libation.</p>

<p>Jon Fia and Tobaccos of Hawaii will pair three carefully selected cigars with the assortment of scotches to be enjoyed. Murphy’s Bar and Grill will provide perfectly prepared New York steaks. </p>

<p>Yes, it’s indulgent and perhaps enough to make health freaks picket. But the word “premium” exists for a reason.</p>

<p><b>&#8220;Scotch, Steaks, and Stogies&#8221;<br />
Wednesday, October 20<br />
The Celtic Cultural Center behind O’Toole’s Irish Pub<br />

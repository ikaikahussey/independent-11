<p><b>Why are you running for office? </b><br />
&#8220;The Heritage Area Group&#8221; and &#8220;Against The Heritage Area Group&#8221; came in front of the Kalihi/Palama Neighborhood Board, which I was a member of last year and did a presentation. I was shocked that my opponent knew about the Heritage Area for five to six years and in fact, was very much involved in trying to put it into legislation here. She failed to inform her constituents about it. I have testified about this in front of Sen. Carol Fukunaga with other citizens. As of now, it is on hold in Washington, D.C. </p>

<p><b>What is the single most important issue for your constituents?</b><br />
To stop legislation of the National Heitage Area.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
More media attention to it.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b> <br />
Mr. Allen Stack.</p>

<p><b>What’s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b>&nbsp; <br />
We need it. Good question.</p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted in favor of House Bill 444?</b><br />
I would have voted for it. I believe in equality!</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
No vote, no grumble.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii’s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Give them incentives, tax breaks.</p>

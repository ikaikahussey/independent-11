<p>Two veteran ska bands from California come to Honolulu next week for two separate mini-tours that will see the bands share billing at Breakers in Haleiwa. The Upbeat hails from Carpinteria, near Santa Barbara. They have toured steadily and nationally for the past 18 years. Warsaw Poland Brothers makes its home in the high California desert of Yucca Valley. Both bands spend 200 to 300 days on the road touring each year.</p>

<p>The Upbeat and Warsaw Poland Brothers have worked together often in the past, and each is worthy of top billing wherever they play. Seeing them together in Honolulu will be a special treat for ska fans here.</p>

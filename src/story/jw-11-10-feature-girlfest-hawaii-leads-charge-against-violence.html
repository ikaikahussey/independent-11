<p>HONOLULU&#8212;It’s time once again for the 7th Annual GiRL FeST Hawaii multimedia art festival and conference&#8212;a celebration of music, spoken word, art, and education intended to help stop the tide of violence against women and girls in Hawaii and all over the world. Each year, non-Executive Director Kathryn Xian puts together a collection of world-class artists, performers, thinkers, and activists over as week of events at a number of Honolulu venues.</p>

<p>The opening night concert on Wednesday, November 10 takes place at The Venue on Bethel Street will feature the local talents of <b>Hope Mayo, Emi Hart, Tiffa Garza, Carly Smith, Lei Melket</b>, and indy band <b>Shopping List</b>.</p>

<p><i>Salt of the Sea</i> makes its Hawaii film debut at the Art Auditorium at UH Manoa on Thursday. The film won the International Critics Award FIPRESCI Prize, and tells the story of a Brooklyn-born Palestinian seeking to reclaim her roots. There will be an encore presentation on Friday at the auditorium as well.</p>

<p>Thursday night features GiRL FeST Hawaii&#8217;s Spit and Spin Party at Fresh Café on Queen Street. Female deejays from KTUH Radio will be on hand to spin records, and nationally acclaimed poet <b>Mindy Nettifee</b> is scheduled to perform, as are local favorites <b>Brenda Kwon, Issil Park</b> and <b>Lyz Soto</b>. </p>

<p>Other performers scheduled for GiRL FeST Hawaii 2010 include<b> Hell Caminos, Black Square,</b> and <b>Dirty Genes</b>.

The Bands Against Violence show at Anna O’Brien’s (formerly Anna Bannana’s) on Friday includes these bands as well as hip hop artist <b>Nickie P</b>, who will be joined by champion slam poet <b>Natasha “T” Miller</b>.</p>

<p>In addition to the stellar caliber of performers and social events, GiRL FeST Hawaii also offers a variety of workshops, including improv comedy, t-shirt art, slam poetry, “zine” production, and self-defense.</p>

<p>For seven years, GiRL FeST Hawaii has been leading the charge against violence against women and girls through art and education. Poised to carry that fight well into the future, GiRL FeST Hawaii continues to make a difference.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Hawaii artists KC Grennan and Scott Fitzel open the <i>Firewater</i> exhibition at the <a href="http://www.peggehopper.com/" title="Pegge Hopper Gallery">Pegge Hopper Gallery</a> in Chinatown tonight. The exhibition features experimental techniques combining the use of molten glass, heat, water, and wood. The exhibition is part of the galley’s Choice Art 3 program and supports <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/hawaii/" title="Planned Parenthood Hawaii">Planned Parenthood Hawaii</a>. The exhibition runs from November 10 to December 4.</p>

<p>Grennan is creating paintings of contemplative fish floating through dream like color fields, surrounded by botanical hybrids from a lush world similar but not quite like our own. The fine detail of these paintings is created by burning and carving into the surface of the wood panel with a 1,000 degree metal tool, which leaves line work similar in appearance to fine line single needle tattoo work crossed with etchings from  the era of Albrecht Durer.</p>

<p>Fitzel&#8217;s paintings are primarily interpretations, representations, and abstractions of the surrounding natural environment&#8212;the sun, the sky, the ocean and the forest in the ever changing forms they embody.&nbsp; There is a constant vibration in these elements, an electricity that is ever present and visible if one allows their presence to be felt and not taken for granted. These paintings are an attempt to capture and portray this energy that surrounds us.&nbsp; </p>

<p>By working directly with 2,300 degree molten glass, the embodiment of liquid fire itself, the line-work is drawn, burned, and scarred into the surface of the wood. The glass flows as water flows, it burns as fire burns, and because of its fiery nature can&#8217;t be touched&#8212;it can only be guided in a direction and never completely controlled. The result of this drawing with fire is an image made by and vibrating with the movement of fire itself.</p>

<p>Grennan and Fitzel are each accomplished visual artists in a variety of media. They studied under the world famous glass sculptor Dale Chihuly and have held many exhibitions at numerous Hawaii galleries. Grennan’s work was most recently featured at the Contemporary Café at The Contemporary Museum.</p>

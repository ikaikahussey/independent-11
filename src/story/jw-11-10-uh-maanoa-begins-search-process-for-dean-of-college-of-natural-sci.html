<p>MANOA&#8212;The University of Hawaii at Manoa’s Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs has initiated a formal search process for the regular appointment of Dean of the College of Natural Sciences. Dr. Alan Teramura has served as Interim Dean since January 2008. </p>

<p>UH Manoa has been evaluating the use of interim appointments for leadership positions, and is working toward regular appointments. The leadership post at the College of Natural Sciences is among the initial recruitments of the campus-wide effort.</p>

<p>“This is an absolutely key position to all of our efforts to move Manoa forward, as the College provides all the key gateway courses in STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] fields, offers some of the most popular majors, and has strong graduate programs and research programs,” said Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Reed Dasenbrock in a statement. </p>

<p>College of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch will chair the 13-member Search Advisory Committee, which will recommend finalists to Manoa Chancellor Virginia Hinshaw and Vice Chancellor Dasenbrock. The committee includes chairs, faculty, staff, and students from the College, as well as representatives of the Kualii Council and UH Alumni Association.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>The Center on the Family at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the State Department of Human Services have released the <a href="http://uhfamily.hawaii.edu/publications/brochures/HomelessServiceUtilization2010.pdf" title="Homeless Service Utilization Report: Hawaii 2010">Homeless Service Utilization Report: Hawaii 2010</a>. The report provides data about the demographic characteristics of individuals and families who accessed homeless support services during the fiscal year 2010. </p>

<p>Facts brought to light in the report include an increase in &#8220;homeless&#8221; service usage in the City and County of Honolulu from 2009-2010. Hawaii County saw a significant increase of 15 percent in outreach service usage, but also a significant decrease of 12 percent in shelter service usage.</p>

<p>A total of 13,886 people experienced &#8220;homelessness&#8221; and received shelter and/or outreach services in FY 2010, an increase of 3 percent over the year before. Just under three thousand Hawaii children experienced &#8220;homelessness&#8221; with their families and accessed services. Based on parental reports, 25 percent of those children have one or more physical, mental behavioral or developmental issues that caused their parents concern. </p>

<p>The Ala Moana/Kakaako Neighborhood Board met on Tuesday, October 26 at Makiki Christian Church. State Representatives Tom Brower and Karl Rhodes were in attendance, as well as representatives from the Honolulu Mayor’s Office, Police Department, and Fire Department.</p>

<p>HFD reported responding to 15 fires, 201 medical emergencies, and 26 search and rescue missions in September. Among the HPD response statistics for September were 17 assaults, 27 DUI offenses, and 132 motor vehicle collisions. Four sexual offenses and 13 motor vehicle thefts were also notable among HPD’s September responses.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Although no direct actions were taken during the meeting, several pertinent community concerns were discussed. Of particular concern to the Board is a resolution regarding liquor license establishments in Kakaako. It was noted that the brothel Sakura continues to operate in the same building as Little Seoul Restaurant, where two men were recently reported firing handguns at 4:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Board Chair Larry Hurst requested that members reconsider their support of Choi’s Garden receiving a liquor license. Members were also asked to oppose Tsukiji’s Fish Market and Restaurant’s request for a 4:00 a.m. cabaret closing license.</p>

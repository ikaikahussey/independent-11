<p>Los Angelese-based hip hop artist Murs comes to Nextdoor in Chinatown tonight, for a one-night only performance. Murs has been in the hip hop scene since 1993, when his group 3 Melancholy Gypsies released its first single. Nearly twenty years later, MURS signed with the major label Warner Brothers and released <i>Murs for President</i> in 2008.</p>

<p>Murs has been attached to well over a dozen solo and collaborative releases and has become known to many as “hip hop’s voice of common sense” for his thoughtful and often humorous outlook. Opening the show will be the Hawaii hip hop outfit Creed Chameleon. DJ Packo, Coop D’Ville, and Durtie Rice will be spinning between performances.</p>

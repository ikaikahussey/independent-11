<p>The Liliha/Puunui/Alewa/Kamehameha Heights Neighborhood Board met on Monday, October 11 at Maemae Elementary. </p>

<p>Representatives from HPD and HFD were on hand, as well as representatives from the Department of Transportation Services and State Representative Corinne Ching’s office.</p>

<p>HFD responded to two structure fires in September and to 61 medical emergency calls. HPD’s Major William Chur discussed a significant decrease in the number of property crimes and motor vehicle collisions in the month of September. Chur stated that it is difficult to identify what attributes to a drop in those statistics. Chur was thanked for the increased HPD patrols in the area of Hala Drive and Keola Street.</p>

<p>Board of Water Supply representative Iris Oda noted that BWS has been proactive in its effort to prevent vandalism and theft at BWS facilities. Oda urged that residents be vigilant and report suspicious activity at BWS facilities to HPD, at remote facilities in particular.</p>

<p>The Liliha/Puunui/Alewa Neighborhood Board is scheduled to meet at Maemae Elementary on Monday, November 8. A government agencies forum will include officials from HPD, HFD, and several City and State elected officials. State Department of Transportation Highways Division Administrator Ed Sniffen will be on hand to give a presentation about the crosswalks on Pali Highway.</p>

<p>Current unfinished Board business includes a complaint for a residence on Judd Street being used as a meditation center. The Kuakini Extension Project is to be updated, as the State has released $2 million for the design and construction of a parking lot at Maluhia Hospital. There is also a proposed resolution to allow new lease to the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center to operate the Alewa Heights Alzheimer’s Respite Care Center that will be discussed.</p>

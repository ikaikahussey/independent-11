<p>Laughtrack Theater, the only theater in Hawaii devoted to improvisational comedy, has announced that it will offer a children’s program to begin January 25. Artistic Director Shannon Winpenny is a 10-year veteran of the legendary Second City and Imrov Olympic programs in Chicago. The classes offer children ages 11 to 16 the opportunity to learn the art of improv, while developing trust with others and themselves, to learn team-building skills, hone the ability to adapt to new situations, as well as to cultivate self confidence.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Through the program, children can develop important life skills and build self-improvement in a fun, safe, and nonjudgmental environment. Classes will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays for eight weeks. The last day of classes will feature a performance by the students for their families and friends. </p>

<p>A handful of bar and liquor industry people, led by veteran Mark Becker, have put together the 12 Bars of Christmas event in Chinatown on Saturday to benefit two worthy charities: the Hawaii Children’s Cancer Foundation and the Make A Wish Foundation.</p>

<p>The goal is to get as many needy children in Hawaii a present for Christmas and to let them know they have people who are watching out for them. The 12 Bars of Christmas is a pub crawl where friends, family, and acquaintances will walk the streets of Chinatown and enjoy 12 great establishments. Simultaneously, there will also be a toy and canned good drive. If the patrons bring either one they will get one free raffle ticket for various prizes.</p>

<p>Participants donate $25 and receive a Santa hat and t-shirt to wear while visiting the 12 participating bars, which include thirtyninehotel, Bar 35, Next Door, Soho Mix Media Bar, Bambuu 2, Mercury Bar, Indigo, O’Toole’s Irish Pub, Manifest, JJ Dolan’s, Du Vin, and Murphy’s Bar and Grill. Participants will check in at SoHo between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.</p>

<p>A toy and canned food drive will also be held, and those who bring either will receive one free raffle ticket. Participants will visit each participating bar, although they are not required to have an alcoholic beverage at each stop. Discounted drinks may apply at certain establishments.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE: KAUPA cancelled Saturday and Sunday&#8217;s rock wall workshop due to unforseen circumstances.</b></p>

<p>The Kalihi Ahupuaa Ulu Pono Ahahui, or KAUPA, will build a traditional Native Hawaiian dry stack rock wall at the conservation group’s Kalihi Stream restoration site on Saturday, December 18 and Sunday, December 19. KAUPA works with volunteers and the Kalihi community to restore and preserve the natural and cultural resources of Kalihi Valley through education and community service.</p>

<p>Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Billy Fields will be on hand to provide guidance for the wall’s construction. Fields is a respected, 20-year practitioner of uhau humu pohaku who has been involved in the reburial of over 5700 sets of human remains, or iwi, and he has been involved in the restoration of many heiau, fishponds, and terraced taro patches.</p>

<p>The event is open to volunteers and free to attend. KAUPA, a non-profit cultural and educational organization, is accepting donations to help offset the costs of the wall’s construction. Donors can purchase pebbles, rocks, or boulders to be used in the walls construction.</p>

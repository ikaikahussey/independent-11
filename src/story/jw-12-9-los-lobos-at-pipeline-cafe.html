<p>Los Lobos return to Hawaii for a quick mini-tour that will see them perform on four islands in as many days. The first will be at Pipeline Café on Thursday. They catapulted into the mainstream with 1987’s <i>La Bamba</i>, but there is more depth to their sound than is contained in the Richie Valens classic. </p>

<p>Combining rock, blues, Tex-Mex, R&amp;B with traditional Spanish and Mexican music, they’ve released well over a dozen albums, and they have won multiple Grammy Awards. </p>

<p>Most fans would say, however, that their true appeal lies in the live shows. And those shows routinely sell out, so it’s a good idea to get tickets early. A portion of the proceeds go to the <a href="http://www.aloha.com/~lifeguards/jrguards.html" title="Junior Lifeguard Program">Junior Lifeguard Program</a> on all islands.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the Junior Lifeguard Program is to increase the self-confidence, physical conditioning, and ocean awareness of program participants through their introduction to water safety, first-aid, and surf rescue techniques.&nbsp; </p>

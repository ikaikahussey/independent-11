"caption":"The Deadbeats formed midway through 2007 and are pretty much true to their name. They drink and jam and beg for change. With a charismatic, neighborly optimistic approach on life combined with Jazzy-hip-hopy-funky-rocky-super-dopetronical beats and charmingly lucid lyrics the Deadbeats will be the last to take themselves seriously, but seriously take you.  <i>Courtesy Photo</i>",

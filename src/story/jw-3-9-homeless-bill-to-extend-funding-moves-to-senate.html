<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On Tuesday, March 8, the House of Representatives passed House Bill 898, which channels funds to the Housing First Pilot Program for &#8220;chronically homeless&#8221; individuals. </p>

<p>The bill extends the lapsed date of previous appropriations from the emergency and budget reserve fund for the development and implementation of Housing First.</p>

<p>&#8220;The passage of this bill is crucial to continue to address the urgent issue of &#8216;homelessness&#8217; in Hawaii,” said Rep. Rida Cabanilla in a statement. “This measure would provide the Department of Human Services and the Hawaii Public Housing Authority the resources and manpower necessary to carry out the intended purpose of the Housing First Pilot Program. This extension would grant the State more time to implement the pilot program, which would be an investment for the future in addressing the State&#8217;s &#8216;homelessness&#8217; issues. &#8220;</p>

<p>The Housing First Pilot Program combines emergency housing with social services and medical treatment for the &#8220;chronically homeless,&#8221; particularly individuals with history of substance abuse and/or mental illness.&nbsp; </p>

<p>House Bill 898 will be transmitted to the Hawaii State Senate for further discussion and consideration.</p>

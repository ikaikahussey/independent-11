<p><i>The roots of Shangri La lie in Doris Duke&#8217;s decision to build a seasonal home in Honolulu after her honeymoon in 1935. On her honeymoon, she visited Muslim countries for the first time and her journey also  included an extended stay in Hawaii. Finding herself captivated by Islamic cultures and enamored with Hawaii, Doris Duke designed her new home in collaboration with architect Marion Sims Wyeth to evoke the beauty and character of each. Shangri La borrows architectural elements and artistic sensibilities from regions of the Islamic world, and blends them with a distinctly Hawaiian landscape that features sweeping ocean views, exotic gardens and a 75-foot saltwater pool.</i></p>

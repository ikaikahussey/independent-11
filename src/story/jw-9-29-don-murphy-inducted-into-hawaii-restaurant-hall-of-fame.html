<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Murphy’s Bar and Grill owner Don Murphy was inducted into the Hawaii Restaurant Association Hall of Fame on Monday night. For more than 20 years, Murphy’s has occupied a historic old building that was built in 1890 as the Royal Saloon. Murphy’s is a home away from home for countless locals and visitors, all of whom enjoy the impeccable hospitality, value, and customer service for which the restaurant is known.</p>

<p>Murphy’s will host a fundraiser for the Sheraton Hawaii Bowl Foundation on Thursday, with the restaurant closing for the block party. The foundation supports over 20 charities, including the Na Koa Booster Club for University of Hawaii Athletics. Over 60 beers will be on hand, as well as heavy pupus and entertainment. Tickets are $60 in advance and $75 at the door.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Catherine’s Closet Vintage Clothing recently opened in a historic building on Merchant Street in Downtown. Owner Catherine Fong had previously operated her business in Manoa, enjoying a regular clientele. So a move into a new area during uncertain economic times was a bit risky.</p>

<p>“I feel like I’ve started over,” says Fong.</p>

<p>When asked how her new location in Downtown differs from her previous Manoa digs, Fong laughs. “I have to dress up now!” She chats breezily about the advantages and challenges of opening her new store, as a young female customer marvels at the rich, colorful pastiche of dresses, scarves, and all manner of baubles festooning the walls.</p>

<p>Fong says foot traffic has increased significantly at her new location, although she cites a lack of convenient parking as one of the challenges she faces. Many of her customers are people who are already Downtown, and who find her store while window shopping.</p>

<p>To adapt to the changing marketplace, Fong has found ways to create services that attract a specific clientele. Chief among her strategies is to offer a private shopping experience, closing the store to the public and allowing clients to browse and try on clothes and other adornments in a casual but classy atmosphere. Fong says that the private shopping experience is popular with bridal parties and prom-goers that are looking for a unique way to express themselves for an event.</p>

<p>Catherine’s Closet is a truly apt name for Fong’s business, as much of her inventory consists of items she has collected over the years. “I have an obsession with rescuing beautiful things,” she says. What was once a hobby has become a full-time job as an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>And although her hobby has become her business, she maintains a passion for seeing people connect with the things she’s come across. “It is still a joy to see the right person find the right thing,” she smiles.</p>

<p>In addition to her passion for vintage clothing, Fong is also an ardent supporter of the arts. She is an actor, and has appeared in productions at Diamond Head Theater and with The Actors Group. She confesses that her obsession with vintage clothing and her love of acting are probably connected, mainly through the eclectic wardrobes that fill the back rooms of theater companies everywhere.</p>

<p><br />
Tucked into a cozy corner between Fort Street and Bishop Street, Catherine’s Closet has made new friends and cultivated a new clientele. The variety of elegant vintage wear draws people in daily, and there is always something to capture a shopper’s imagination. </p>

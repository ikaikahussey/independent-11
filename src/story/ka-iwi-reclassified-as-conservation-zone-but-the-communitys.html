<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Present and future generations of Oahu conservationists were given reason to celebrate on June 4 when Gov. Linda Lingle announced that, after a decades’ long struggle, the Ka Iwi coastine had been formally reclassified from urban to conservation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The State <a href="http://luc.state.hi.us" title="Land Use Commission">Land Use Commission</a> (LUC) voted unanimously to protect the makai portion of the region from future development. The communities of Hawaii Kai and Waimanalo have fought for over 30 years to save this geological, botanical, recreational, and scenic site from development, as land owners have changed over the years and brought forth new development proposals such as resort hotels, golf courses, residential development, and vacation cabins. Oahu’s citizens have continually organized to defend the wild natural character and scenery of the island’s southernmost tip, which is now the last remaining stretch of undeveloped coastline on Oahu.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The pristine Ka Iwi coast, eponymous with the ancient name of the channel between Oahu and Molokai, encompasses approximately 215 acres of State-owned land between Queen’s Beach and the Makapuu Lighthouse. “Ka Iwi” literally means “the bone”, suggesting strength and mana. The name seems appropriate for a site where some of the last volcanic eruptions on Oahu occurred, resulting in its spectacular cliffs and craters.&nbsp; More recently, the unforgettable shoreline featured prominently in the popular television series, Lost. </p>

<p>“The reclassification should make future development of this portion of the Ka Iwi Coast a remote possibility in keeping with the wishes of the East Honolulu and greater Oahu community,” Lingle said. “I applaud the many individuals and organizations throughout the community who have worked tirelessly and passionately to protect this pristine part of our state.”</p>

<p>Longtime activist Phil Esterman first became involved in saving the coastline alongside David Matthews in the mid-1980s when Henry Kaiser’s proposed resort, which had been fought off only a few years earlier, resurfaced as a threat to the region. Together, they organized the Save Sandy Beach Coalition to protect the shoreline. </p>

<p>In 1987, there was also a proposal for a housing development across the highway from Queen’s beach, which the community rallied against by holding up banners at the height of the proposed rooflines, giving the public a sense of what it would be like to have houses there. Having worked in environmental protection since the 1970s, Esterman said he has a “lot of faith in [the public’s] desire to protect Hawaii’s natural resources and beauty” and has witnessed great progress in the power of grassroots activism in Hawaii.&nbsp; He sees this recent victory for Ka Iwi as “a cap on decades of effort” and a significant milestone in the history of Hawaii, something that can inspire future generations to fight for the land.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>The saga continues</b></p>

<p>The fight now is for the mauka side of the region, which is still part of the urban district and therefore much more vulnerable. Most recently, a proposed development of cabins was met with public opposition and has been thwarted, at least temporarily, since it lacked a clear recreational component. Esterman points out that this opposition “needs to be sustained,” as the mountainside of the Ka Iwi coast is an integral part of the open space resource. He has spent the past five years helping to educate and mentor members of the Ka Iwi Coalition to stay involved, engaged, and vigilant, as there will always be pressure to develop.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hawaii Kai Board Member Gary Weller similarly urges people to understand that this reclassification is hardly irreversible. Zoning is “fluid,” he explains, and can change according to current legislation. In other words, if a new generation of lawmakers wanted to redesignate this land as urban, it could vote to overturn the current conservation. </p>

<p>Moreover, there is the possibility for variances within the conservation land to improve infrastructure or alleviate congestion. For instance, in 2006, parking areas for scenic overlooks and for hikers of the Makapuu Lighthouse trail were completed. While efforts like these can on the one hand promote awareness of the region’s unique value by making it more accessible to nature lovers and hikers, there is also a potential for them to gradually diminish its unspoiled character if left unchecked.</p>

<p>Weller agrees that the next step is to get the mountain zoning changed to conservation as well, and that in order to achieve this goal there needs to be heightened awareness among the younger generation. He recognizes that people tend to “attach themselves to the ocean” but that, in fact, preserving the mauka scenery is fundamental to maintaining the beauty of the coast&#8212;it just depends on which direction one looks.</p>

<p>Ka Iwi Coalition member Ann Marie Kirk still remembers when the earlier version of this movement, the aforementioned Save Sandy Beach Coalition, was formed when she was just a child. She joined the movement herself roughly five years ago as someone who grew up in the region and continues to enjoy “the ride” to Makapuu on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Kirk was part of a sub group that worked to change the name to Ka Iwi Coalition, in order to better provide a “sense of place” and a broader history of the region from a Hawaiian perspective. Ka Iwi refers to the entire region from Hanauma to Makapuu, encompassing far more than just Sandy Beach, and as she puts it, “you don’t break the bone.” She also stresses the importance of continuing with Esterman and Matthew’s work of promoting awareness to ensure the coast stays open for future generations. “People don’t realize the hours that people have put into saving this coastline.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>In addition to its stunning natural beauty, Kirk says, the area is replete with cultural and religious value, which could help drive the preservation movement forward.</p>

<p>Lingle also noted the battle to preserve Ka Iwi for future generations is not over and that the potential development of this land remains of paramount concern to the community.</p>

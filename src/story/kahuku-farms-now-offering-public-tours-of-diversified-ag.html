<p>KAHUKU&#8212;Kahuku Farms is now offering tours of its facilities to those interested in seeing how diversified agriculture is being implemented on Oahu. </p>

<p>Kahuku Farms is a family operated business growing papaya, long eggplant, taro leaf, apple banana, and cacao for chocolate, among other things. The tours are organized by Kylie Matsuda, who says that the farms supplies a variety of supermarkets. Kahuku Farms sells a variety of culinary and bath and body products as well.</p>

<p>Kahuku Farms was incorporated by Clyde Fukuyama and Melvin Matsuda in 1995, both of whom are third-generation farmers. Leasing land from Campbell Estate, Dole Foods, the State of Hawaii, and Kamehameha Schools, Kahuku Farms spans over 300 acres.</p>

<p>The tractor-pulled tours provide detailed information about the history, people, and products produced at Kahuku Farms. Tours include a sampling of the farmâ€™s products. Specialty tours are available for schools, church groups, and seniors. Discounts are available. The farm plans to offer daily tours beginning late July.</p>

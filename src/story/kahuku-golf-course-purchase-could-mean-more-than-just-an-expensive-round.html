<p>Honolulu City Councilman Ernie Martin says a Chinese company wants to buy Kahuku Golf Course, the only public golf course in the North half of the island, from current land-owners Continental Pacific. The city currently has a year-to-year lease on the property and the kama‘aina rate for a round of golf is only $9 on weekdays and $10 on the weekends.</p>

<p>According to Martin,the sale could take place within the next 60 days. He believes the Chinese company intends to keep the property as a golf course and also make improvements to it. <a href="http://www.khon2.com/2013/09/06/councilman-says-theres-been-an-offer-to-buy-kahuku-golf-course/">Facebook comments</a> from the public do not share his optimism.</p>

<p>Facebook user Dedduck writes: &#8220;Don&#8217;t count on it! The Chinese company has way bigger plans for the land and it sure is not a golf course. First they buy the land and then they buy the politician, if he isn&#8217;t bought already. Now comes the mega development, so watch out Kahuku residents and also surrounding towns; traffic will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>While golf courses aren&#8217;t high on my list of things to write about, development definitely is. The Ko‘olau Loa community is already dealing with the Ko‘olau Loa Sustainable Communities Plan (which includes a great deal of the <a href="http://envisionlaie.com/">Envision Lā‘ie</a> plan) which has already passed first reading with the City Council and, if adopted, would mean a large-scale development centered around BYU and the Polynesian Cultural Center. I&#8217;m inclined to agree with Dedduck, at least in my suspicion that Kahuku Golf Course won&#8217;t be a golf course after this Chinese company gets a hold of it. </p>

<p>The Kahuku Community Association sponsored a resolution that encourages the city to take possession of this parcel and the Ko‘olau Loa Neighborhood Board unanimously endorsed this initiative. Last year, the City Council unanimously passed a resolution to have the city acquire the parcel. Then-mayor Peter Carlisle, as well as current mayor Kirk Caldwell, both declined to act on the resolution, saying that the matter was not a municipal affair.</p>

<p>Kent Fonoimoana, a member of the Ko’olau Loa Neighborhood Board (#28) has started a <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/mayor-kirk-caldwell-and-council-chair-ernest-martin-keep-kahuku-golf-course-a-municipal-recreation-area">petition</a> on Change.org to convince the mayor to keep the golf course municipal. &#8220;As our island population grows, we need more municipal facilities - not less,&#8221; says Fonoimoana.</p>

<blockquote><p>To: <br />
Kirk Caldwell, Mayor of the City and County of Honolulu <br />
Ernest Martin, Honolulu City Council Chair <br />
Ann Kobayashi, Honolulu City Council Budget Chair <br />
Aloha Mayor Kirk Caldwell, </p>

<p>I encourage you to explore avenues that will enable the City and County of Honolulu to keep Kahuku Golf Course a municipal recreation area in perpetuity for the use of O&#8217;ahus citizens. <br />
The Kahuku Community Association has requested that you condemn and take possession of the parcel which includes the existing Kahuku Golf Course. The Ko&#8217;olauloa Neighborhood Board unanimously approved Kahuku Community Association&#8217;s resolution to condemn or purchase the Kahuku Golf Course. This is the only municipal golf course that serves the Northern half of O&#8217;ahu and to place it in private hands may make affordable golf a memory to those residents who utilize Kahuku Golf Course. </p>

<p>We strongly urge you to take immediate and prudent action to preserve this parcel for the use of O&#8217;ahu&#8217;s residents.</p>

<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Last night, the 64th Annual Kaimuki Christmas Parade, one of the oldest parades in the state, brought cheer to generations of locals who braved the wind and rain to show their Holiday spirit and civic pride. The celebration started at 6:00 p.m. at the Saint Louis School and Chaminade University campus and traveled up Waialae Avenue to Koko Head Avenue. </p>

<p>The parade, free and open to the public, was sponsored by the Kaimuki Business and Professional Association (KBPA). Government restrictions now prohibit the glittering and colorful Christmas decorations that once spanned Waialae Avenue during the holiday season. However, the Kaimuki Christmas Parade carries on, and continues to be a hit with residents in generating exposure for Kaimuki as a destination.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Parade chairman Dennis Nishiguchi coordinated the event&#8212;securing permits, police, road blockage, City approvals, etc.&#8212;and numerous others within the organization helped to secure participants, raise money, guide volunteers, manage the crowds, and do everything else required to make the parade run smoothly.</p>

<p>The event also marked the official lighting of the Kaimuki Christmas tree on top Puu O Kaimuki, also known as Menehune Hill. Each year, KBPA provides the lights and decorations for both the tree and Kaimuki Community Park. The Kaimuki Community Park organizes volunteers from the Hawaiian Electric Company to string the lights.</p>

<p>Newly elected Mayor Peter Carlisle came by on a fire truck, and other local politicians such as Sen. Les Ihara (District 9), House Speaker Calvin Say (District 20), Rep. Barbara Marumoto (District 19), and newly elected City Councilman Stanley Chang (District 4) participated in the parade.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As tradition would have it, Santa’s eagerly awaited appearance on a red convertible was the grand finale, though he may have been somewhat upstaged by the Grinch this year, who sped by on a sled alongside a crew of intrepid Waialae Elementary students.</p>

<p>In total, approximately 40 Kaimuki businesses, schools bands, and community groups marched in the parade this year. Kaimuki Christian Church and School, an institution dedicated to serving the community, was honored as this year’s Grand Marshal. A particularly poignant moment was when Queen Liliuokalani Elementary School marched past, <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/concerned-community-rallies-to-perpetuate-queen-liliuokalanis-legacy-in-kai/" title="a school that is facing a consolidation hearing">a school that is facing a consolidation hearing</a> on Monday, December 13.</p>

<p>The Kaimuki Christmas Parade is an old-school event put on by the community and for the community and truly carries the feel of a small town celebration. Young and old lined the sidewalk eagerly anticipating candy and other goodies passed out by parade participants. It&#8217;s one of those institutions that makes you feel proud to live in Kaimuki, with its diverse population, entrepreneurial spirit, and emphasis on strong community relations.</p>

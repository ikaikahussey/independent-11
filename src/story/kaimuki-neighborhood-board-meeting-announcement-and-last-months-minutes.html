<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;The Kaimiki Neighborhood Board will meet at Liliuokalani Elementary School Cafeteria (3633 Waialae Avenue) on Wednesday, September 15 at 7:15 p.m.&nbsp;  On the agenda is a discussion of the proposed State Constitutional Amendment allowing the governor to appoint the Board of Education.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Last month&#8217;s meeting also focused on education. Randy Obata from the University of Hawaii at Manoa&#8217;s Center for the National Children’s Study provided attendees with an informational packet of the UH medical school’s proposed study of 1,000 Oahu families, part of a $3 billion nationwide research project&#8212;the biggest and most comprehensive health study ever. Researchers hope that by looking at both genetic predisposition to certain disease and certain environmental factors, they can identify exactly why certain people get certain diseases, including autism, asthma, birth defects, heart disease, and obesity.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This past Board meeting also witnessed the appointment of Kaimuki resident John Perez to fill the vacancy in Sub District 1 (Waialae Avenue, Koko Head – 12th Avenue, and Luawai Street). </p>

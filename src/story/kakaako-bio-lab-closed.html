"teaser":"<blockquote> UH officials never mentioned the Kakaako lab was closed for repairs at a contentious public informational meeting about the new proposed lab earlier this month.   The UH closed its bio-safety lab at the medical school in Kakaako for \"planned maintenance\" when the lab's certification expired on June 17 to install new sprinklers and make other improvements. It's a level three lab, capable of dealing with diseases like dengue fever and tuberculosis.  </blockquote>",

<p>Kaka‘ako is evolving – and a key to its evolution is a healthier, more inclusive approach to transportation. Hele On Kaka‘ako is a demonstration project around the &#8220;Complete Streets&#8221; philosophy, which integrates pedestrians, bicycling, and automobile traffic.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://cycloviahawaii.org/">event&#8217;s website</a>:<br />
We will take over the streets in Kaka`ako including –<br />
- 1.5 miles of roadways closed to motorized traffic from Mother Waldron Park to Gateway Park<br />
- Bike repair and maintenance stations<br />
- Helmet and other prize giveaways<br />
- Bicycle education courses<br />
- Aerobics and dance classes<br />
- BMX demonstrations and bike ramp<br />
- Skateboarding ramp<br />
- Cycle On Runway and bike show<br />
- Food, prizes and much more!</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City’s Department of Environmental Services announced that starting Monday, September 20, City-contracted Ideal Construction, Inc., will begin work on the Kalakaua Avenue Sewer Rehabilitation project.</p>

<p>The work consists of open-cut trench digging replacing 1,500 feet of existing 6- and 8-inch terra cotta sewer pipe with new 8- and 10-inch PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) sewer pipe under the sidewalks on the Diamond Head side of Kalakaua Avenue from Kapiolani Boulevard to Philip Street.</p>

<p>One lane will be closed in the mauka direction, and work will only be during the daytime. Motorists should be alert for lane restrictions, changing traffic patterns, slow moving vehicles and construction personnel.</p>

<p>The $3.96 million project is estimated to take one year to complete.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services announced that starting Thursday, August 12, City-contracted Insituform begins construction on the Kalanianaole Highway Sewer Rehabilitation Project between Wailupe Beach Park and Kawaikui Beach Park.</p>

<p>During the next six months, the work will be done intermittingly between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. the following day (19 hours). One lane will be closed in the Koko Head direction and will reopen during peak afternoon traffic hours.</p>

<p>The $9.2 million Kalanianaole project includes the rehabilitation of 7,400 feet of 24- and 30-inch pipe with cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) lining; improving 1,700 feet of 8- and 10-inch diameter pipe with CIPP lining; revitalizing 19 manholes with epoxy liners; modifying the entrance and exit manholes and installing a new liner in the Wailupe Stream inverted siphon to improve the flushing action for cleaning; replacing 28 sewer manhole cones/frames and covers; and cleaning 11,800 feet of 24-, 30- and 36-inch pipe.</p>

<p>The City advises motorists to stay alert for lane restrictions approaching the construction area and remember to stay in their lane once at the construction area and to be aware of changing traffic patterns, slow moving construction vehicles, and construction personnel.</p>

<p>The entire Kalanianaole project is expected to be completed by April 2011.</p>

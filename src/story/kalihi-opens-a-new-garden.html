<p>The garden is part of the ROOTS initiative of <a href="http://kkv.net">Kokua Kalihi Valley</a>, a program which is helping valley residents to build garden boxes and grow food using organic gardening techniques.&nbsp; </p>

<p>KKV’s Executive Director, Dr. David Derauf said, &#8220;We are excited to be a part of creating this garden which has been part of many peoples vision for this community for a long time.” </p>

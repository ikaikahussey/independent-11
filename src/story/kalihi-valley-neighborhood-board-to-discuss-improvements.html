<p>The Kalihi Valley Neighborhood Board is scheduled to meet at 7:00 p.m. Wednesday, March 9 at the Akira Sakima Recreation Center on Kamehameha IV Road. Current Kalihi improvement projects to be discussed are the Kalihi Valley Homes renovation project and safety improvements to an S-turn on Kalihi Street that has been the subject of many frequent concerns expressed by residents at past board meetings.</p>

<p>At the most recent meeting of the board on February 9, many residents expressed concern over a variety of traffic related issues, among them the need for a four-way stop sign at Hihio Place and Kilohi Street due to the number of schoolchildren in the area. The department of Transportation Services will conduct an investigation to assess the request and report to the board at the June 2011 meeting.</p>

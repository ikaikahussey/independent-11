<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A Kamehameha Schools screening committee appointed by the State Probate Court is assisting in the selection of a new Kamehameha Schools trustee. The new trustee will replace Trustee Diane Plotts, who ends her term in June 2011. </p>

<p>Kamehameha Schools is a private, educational, charitable trust founded and endowed by the legacy of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Kamehameha Schools operates a statewide educational system enrolling more than 6,700 students of Hawaiian ancestry at K-12 campuses on O&#8217;ahu, Maui and Hawai&#8217;i and at 31 preschool sites statewide. Thousands of additional Hawaiian learners are also being served through a range of other Kamehameha Schools outreach programs, community collaborations and financial aid opportunities in Hawaii and across the continental United States.</p>

<p>In addition to Plotts, the current Board of Trustees includes Chairman Corbett Kalama, Vice Chairman J. Douglas Ing, Secretary/Treasurer Micah Kane, and Trustee Janeen-Ann Ahulani Olds.</p>

<p>The Trustee Screening Committee will present a list of three candidates to the Probate Court. From that list, the Court will name the new trustee. The appointee would qualify for a five-year term and could be eligible for an additional five-year term, to be determined by the Court.</p>

<p>The committee is looking for active leaders within the community &#8220;with a deep sense of commitment and the ability to ensure Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop&#8217;s vision and legacy continue to be perpetuated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Candidates must possess demonstrated expertise in one or more of the following areas: business administration; finance and investment; strategic planning and policy setting; or areas of interest to Kamehameha Schools, including education, law or governance.</p>

<p>The committee describes an ideal candidate as someone who possesses a recognized reputation of integrity and good character; the capacity to fulfill the responsibilities of a fiduciary under trust law; and respect for and from the community; consistent and active leadership in the community with specific emphasis on issues impacting the well-being of the people of Hawaii; history of success in business, finance or related areas; a formal education; outstanding personal traits including Hawaiian values; and willingness and sincerity to uphold the purposes of the Kamehameha Schools.</p>

<p>The Trustee Screening Committee is made up of seven volunteer community members: Richard Coons; Wendy B. Crabb; George &#8220;Keoki&#8221; Freeland; Cheryl L. Ka&#8217;uhane Lupenui; Benjamin M. Matsubara, Esq.; Wesley Park; and Michael E. Rawlins. Each trustee currently receives an annual compensation of $122,000. The chairperson receives $158,000.</p>

<p><i>Candidates should submit a resume, cover letter, and a statement on their view of the role of a trustee; their vision, goals and objectives for the trust estate; and what they would do to attain those goals. Nominations should be submitted to Trustee Screening Committee, c/o Inkinen &amp; Associates, 1003 Bishop Street Suite 477, Honolulu, HI 96813. Applications can also be faxed to (808) 521-2380 or emailed to jobs@inkinen.com. The deadline is June 10, 2011.</i></p>

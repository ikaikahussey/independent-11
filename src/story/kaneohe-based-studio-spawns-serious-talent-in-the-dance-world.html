<p>KANEOHE&#8212;A group of local dancers are currently finding national success, performing with the likes of Janet Jackson, Lady Gaga, and Rihanna. Aside from their budding dance careers, these dancers share another thing in common: They all trained at the same studio, 24-7 danceforce (24-7).</p>

<p>“In general, Hawaii has a lot of talented dancers. I’m just glad 24-7 has the facility, staff, and connections to help further the careers of its dancers,” says Marcelo Pacleb, director and founder of 24-7.</p>

<p>The studio is a non-profit organization located in the Windward Mall, open to ages 4 and up. Class prices range from $13 to $18 and are offered at various times on Monday through Saturday.</p>

<p>In the last two decades, 24-7 grew from a group of friends having fun on the dance floor to a serious outlet for grooming Hawaii&#8217;s top talent.</p>

<p>“We started in 1991 and it was an all male company then,&#8221; Pacleb explains. &#8220;After school or work, we would all get together and play around and dance. When a friend asked us to perform at their restaurant, we decided to put together a number. Because we couldn’t find a time to rehearse, we ended up rehearsing at 4 o’clock in the morning. From that day on, we said we’d rehearse any time of the day. That’s how we got our name”</p>

<p>24-7’s mission is “to continuously motivate and create as a company in the art of dance and life: to always grow as individuals, becoming people of good character and integrity&#8212;always compassionate for others while inspiring others to strive for their highest.”</p>

<p>Its a message that&#8217;s reflected in the success of Pacleb&#8217;s choreography and continued on through 24-7&#8217;s dancers. Pacleb is director for the UH Rainbow Warrior Dancers and has choreographed many theatre productions (one for which he won a Na Hoku Hanohano award). The studio also does charity work for the mentally disabled and have a regular gig performing at the annual Miss Hawaii Scholarship Pageant.</p>

<p>Outside of the islands, 24-7 has represented well in the nationally televised dance show <i>So You Think You Can Dance</i> (SYTYCD).&nbsp; 24-7’s own Mark Kanemura and Kupono Aweau both made it to the top 10 and danced on the SYTYCD tour. Aweau now performs various gigs around the United States and Kanemura is a part of Lady Gaga’s latest “Monster Ball Tour.”&nbsp; 24-7 alumn Whyley Yoshimura is touring with Rihanna on “The Last Girl on Earth Tour.” </p>

<p>And last month, Lake Smits, another former dancer of 24-7, performed on the <i>American Idol</i> finale with Janet Jackson. He is slated to perform with Jackson at the Essence Music Festival on July 2.</p>

<p>“This is the most amazing experience any dancer can go through. It’s like living in a dream,” Smits says. “The training at 24-7 has prepared me for this big gig. If it weren’t for 24-7, I wouldn’t be where I am today. Thanks a lot to Marcelo and the support of my family.”&nbsp;  </p>

<p>And the buck doesn’t stop there. 24-7’s talent has also extended over into movies. Former 24-7 dancer Alicia Vela-Bailey was a stunt double for the lead character, Zoe Saldana, in last year’s blockbuster <i>Avatar.</i> She says about the experience: “I had no idea <i>Avatar</i> was going to be this big. I loved working on Avatar; it was so much fun. I feel so lucky and honored to be a part of something so groundbreaking.”</p>

<p>“Because of my dance training, I was able to pick up new choreography and movement that I wasn&#8217;t used to,&#8221; Vela-Bailey adds. &#8220;Staying humble and having a good positive attitude while working, no matter how stressed you are, is also something I learned while dancing at 24-7.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the studio&#8217;s lasting message of compassion and integrity reflected in its dancers, 24-7&#8217;s latest crop of success is sure to inspire Hawaii&#8217;s next generation of talent.</p>

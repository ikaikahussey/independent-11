<p>KANEOHE&#8212;There will be a public information and scoping meeting on Tuesday, September 28 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at Benjamin Parker Elementary School Cafeteria regarding the &#8220;Kaneohe to Kailua Wastewater Treatment and Conveyance Project.&#8221;</p>

<p>The project involves the development of an Environmental Impact Statement for the construction of an additional conveyance for wastewater from the Kaneohe pre-treatment plant to the Kailua treatment at Aikahi.&nbsp; </p>

<p>There are two options currently on the table: (1) A force main to be constructed under the floor of Kaneohe Bay from Waikalua loko (near mouth of Kaneohe Stream) to Aikahi; and (2) a gravity tunnel that starts about 35 foot below sea level in Kaneohe, travels under Oneawa hills, and ends at 60 foot below sea level at Aikahi. </p>

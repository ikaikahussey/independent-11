<p>William Cole of the <i>Star-Advertiser</i> reports that two squadrons and 18 sub-hunting and surveillance planes are expected to be stationed in Hawaii in 2015.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kaneohe resident Elayne Pool, who has lived along the bay for 32 years, said she expects the P-8As to add to the din.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want them to be here,&#8221; the 83-year-old said. &#8220;The noise factor is going to be incredible. Noise is a factor in this bay â€” it&#8217;s a basin and it resonates.&#8221;</p>

<p>She added that she can clearly see the underbellies of the P-3C Orions on approach from her condo a block off the beach, and she&#8217;s concerned about the torpedoes, cruise missiles, bombs and mines the planes can carry.</p>

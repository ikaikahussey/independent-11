<p>HONOLULU&#8212;<a href="http://kantoreirockford.com/" target="_blank">The Kantorei Singing Boys of Rockford</a>, Illinois will perform from noon to 1:00 p.m. on Friday, July 1, in the Honolulu Hale Courtyard, and the public is invited.</p>

<p>The group is well-known for uncompromising standards of excellence in choral art, and will also participate in the July 3 Celebration Parade along Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki. The parade begins at 6:00 p.m., and will be followed at 7:15 p.m. by a Sunset on the Beach event at Queen&#8217;s Surf Beach, featuring the new film &#8220;Soul Surfer.&#8221; Kantorei and the Royal Hawaiian Band will perform prior to the film.</p>

<p>Since 1964, hundreds of boys and young men, ages 6 through 18, have participated in Kantorei. In addition to learning to make music together, they learn important life skills such as self-discipline, responsibility and dedication to common goals.</p>

<p>Kantorei has shared the stage with more than 60 of the finest boy choirs and children&#8217;s choirs from around the world in concerts and prestigious choral festivals, and has released several critically-acclaimed CDs.</p>

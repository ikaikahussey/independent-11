<p>The non-profit community activism group Kanu Hawaii will hold the “Focus on the Budget” informational briefing at the State Capitol Thursday, March 3 at 5:30 p.m. The meeting will shed light in the often opaque process of creating and operating the state budget.</p>

<p>Kanu Hawaii’s series “Rotunda Roundup” gathers every Thursday at the State Capitol to examine aspects of how the Legislature works and to encourage Hawaii residents to become a part of the process. </p>

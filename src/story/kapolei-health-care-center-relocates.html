<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;The Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center’s satellite clinic in Kapolei, the Kapolei Health Care Center, relocated to its new home in the Kapolei Medical Park building last week.</p>

<p>Patients have said they are pleased with the new facility and location.</p>

<p>“The new clinic was a lot nicer and bigger,” said Darcel Baricuatro, mother of one of Kapolei Health Care Center’s first patients at the new site.&nbsp; “Finding the new location was easy and the parking was much better than the first location.”</p>

<p>The organization’s Kapolei Health Care Center’s 6,939 square foot office is nearly three-and-a-half times larger than its original location, with double the amount of exam rooms to service incoming patients.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Patients will also have a larger waiting room and ample parking at the new location, 599 Kamokila Boulevard, located on the corner of Kamokila Boulevard and Fort Barrette Road, across from Chili’s restaurant and next door to Kaiser Permanente.</p>

<p>“The staff is so happy in our new clinic,” said Donna Domingo-Silva, Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center’s Team Office Manager at the Kapolei Health Care Center.&nbsp; “Now that we have this beautiful new office, we have so much more space with which we will be able to provide more services.&nbsp; And with more exam rooms, we are able to see more patients with less waiting time.”</p>

<p>The Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center continues to expand its services through its satellite clinics. This fall the Kapolei Health Care Center also intends to open up pharmacy services.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Currently, the Kapolei Health Care Center provides pediatric, family practice, women’s health, teen clinic, and Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) services. Other programs and services available are nutritional counseling and smoking cessation. Patient assistance services are also available to assist those in need of medical insurance.</p>

<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;Besides the usual summer fun activities, summer school programs, and of course the beach, many keiki are stuck at home figuring out what to do for three months. This summer, the Kapolei Public Library will offer special events to keep our families active in celebration of the 2010 Hawaii State Public Library System Children’s Summer Reading Program from June through July.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>The program fills an important role on Oahu&#8217;s west side, which often has limited options for keiki each summer.</p>

<p>“If you miss signing up for the summer fun programs or can’t enroll your kid because it’s full, then you are stuck because you don’t want your kid at home playing video games all day while you are at work,” said Janet Faye, Kapolei resident and mother of two.</p>

<p>The library&#8217;s summer line up consists of keiki and family story times through the end of August that will include different featured guest readers. All story times will be start at 10:00 a.m. on Mondays and Thursdays and include stories, dance, and songs. Admission is free.</p>

<p>The Child Abuse Prevention Planning Council and State Department of Health are also sponsoring a story time in observance of Child Abuse Prevention Awareness month in July. Target retail store will also be sponsoring three events that will include a performance by the Kenny Endo Taiko ensemble, Mad Science of Hawaii, and a show by the Aloha Clowns. </p>

<p>“[Kapolei Library staff] are doing such a great job offering so many things for not just the kids but the entire family to enjoy for free,&#8221; Faye said. &#8220;We aren’t wasting money at the fair or going to the mall. It’s really great to see how much they are doing for the community, and keeping our kids minds going.”</p>

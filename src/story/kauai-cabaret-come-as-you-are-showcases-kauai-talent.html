<p>Support the work PFLAGKauai is doing with &#8220;Kauai Cabaret&#8212;Come as you are,&#8221; a show full of song, dance, poetry slam, comedy, drag, and drama.</p>

<p>This celebration of diversity in people and in the arts comes together in an evening showcasing some of Kauaiâ€™s best talent. The Cabaret program offers entertainment that everyone can enjoy. There will also be a silent auction with some great items to bid on.</p>

<p>The event benefits two non-profit groups serving Kauai&#8212;PFLAG Kauai and Lambda Aloha. PFLAG Kauai promotes the health and well-being of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender persons, their families, and friends through: support, to cope with an adverse society; education, to enlighten an ill-informed public; and advocacy, to end discrimination and to secure equal civil rights. Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays provides opportunity for dialogue about sexual orientation and gender identity, and acts to create a society that is healthy and respectful of human diversity.</p>

<p>Performers at &#8220;Kauai Cabaret&#8212;Come as you are&#8221; include the cast of <i>Rent</i>, Kauai Sings, Love Tribe, Pink Pebbles Crew and more. <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/hawaii-family-portraits-offers-an-intimate-glimpse-into-our-lgbtq-community/" title="The moving photo exhibit Hawaii Family Portraits will be displayed in the lobby.">The moving photo exhibit Hawaii Family Portraits will be displayed in the lobby.</a></p>

<p>KAUAI&#8212;Effective Jan. 11, 2011, Kauai businesses will be barred from giving their customers single-use plastic bags.</p>

<p>The Kauai County Council on Wednesday voted to join Maui County in banning the bags, which contribute to wildlife deaths and litter and don?t break down in landfills.</p>

<p>Biodegradable bags&#8212;defined as those with no polymers derived from fossil fuels&#8212;will be allowed, as will paper. The county is also planning to distribute 25,000 free re-usable bags to county residents.</p>

<p>Under the bill, businesses can be fined $250 per day for their first violation, and $500 per day if they receive a second violation within a year. The fine goes up to $1,000 per day if the violations continue.</p>

<p>The bill was co-introduced by Councilmembers Tim Bynum and Lani Kawahara. Councilmembers Kaipo Asing and Daryl Kaneshiro voted against the measure, saying they preferred to work on educating people to choose re-usable bags and recycle plastic bags. Enforcement was another issue cited.</p>

<p>Opposition also came from the Kauai Chamber of Commerce, which expressed concerns about increased government intervention in the marketplace, and the Retail Merchants of Hawai&#8217;i and Hawai&#8217;i Food Industry Association, which raised issues about the environmental trade-offs involved with using paper and corn-based biodegradable bags.</p>

<p>Councilman Derek Kawakami abstained from discussion and voting because his family has a chain of local markets.</p>

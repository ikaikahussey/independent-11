<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Derek Kawakami, former Kauai County Councilmember, has been appointed as the newest member of the State House of Representatives. Kawakami was appointed by Gov. Neil Abercrombie to fill the vacant seat of former Rep. Hermina Morita (District 14&#8212;Hanalei, Anahola, Kealia, Kapaa, Waipouli) with a term expiring November 6, 2012.

<p>&#8220;I am pleased to welcome Derek Kawakami to the House of Representatives,&#8221; said Speaker of the House Calvin K.Y.

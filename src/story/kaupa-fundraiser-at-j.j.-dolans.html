<p>The Kalihi Ahupuaa Ulu Pono Ahahui, or KAUPA, is holding a fundraising event at J.J. Dolan’s Irish Pizza is Pub on Tuesday, June 29. Proceeds from the event will be used to fund the creation of a 250-foot public art wall mural at KAUPA Kalihi Stream restoration site near Kalihi Waena Elementary.</p>

<p>A donation of $10 is suggested and includes free pizza from the Best of Honolulu award-winning restaurant. The event begins at 6:00 p.m. and ends at 8:00 p.m. and will include door prizes for attendees. </p>

<p>KAUPA is also looking for artists aged 15 or above who live, work, or play in Kalihi and also have a strong interest in art, developing your talents, and transforming public spaces. Artists must be able to participate in three art workshops on July 17, 24, and 3 and in the painting of the mural the first week of August.</p>

<p>There is also a community meeting on Friday, July 9 from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. at Kalihi Waena Elementary School Cafeteria, 1240 Gulick Ave. KAUPA wants to hear your voice and see your stories visually translated into a mural. The goals of the project are to visually represent the cultural, environmental, social, and political issues and stories of Kalihi. The intention of the meeting is to share information and harness the energy and creativity of the Kalihi community.</p>

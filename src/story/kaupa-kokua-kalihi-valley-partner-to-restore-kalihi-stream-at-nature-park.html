<p>KALIHI &#8212; The <a href="http://www.kaupaforkalihi.org/" target="_blank">Kalihi Ahupuaa Ulu Pono Ahahui</a> (KAUPA) is back from the brink of dissolution thanks to donations to the Save KAUPA Campaign. The nonprofit group will now be able to continue its work toward the restoration of the Kalihi Stream and the Kalihi ahupuaa, and the preservation of the area’s natural and cultural resources.</p>

<p>KAUPA has announced a partnership with <a href="http://www.kkv.net" target="_blank">Kokua Kalihi Valley</a> (KKV), one that will see KAUPA volunteers assist KKV with the restoration of the part of Kalihi Stream that runs through KKV’s nature park property, including the uncovering of an ancient auwai, or irrigation channel. </p>

<p>Both KAUPA and KKV are seeking volunteers for this work, which will be, at times, rigorous. KAUPA provides gloves, bags, boots, and tools, as well as water and light refreshments. It is recommended that volunteers clothes they don’t mind getting dirty, close-toed shoes, sunscreen, and a hat. </p>

<p>The cleanups will take place on Saturday, May 14, May 21, June 11 and June 18, from 8:30 a.m. to noon. Cleanups will also be held on Tuesday/Wednesday through the end of June.</p>

<p>To volunteer, call 381-3643 or email kaupa4kalihi@hawaii.rr.com.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Fifteen Kalihi young people, aged 14 to 30, attended the first of four art workshops in preparation for painting a wall mural along Kalihi Stream. Local artists Meleanna Meyer, John “Prime” Hina, Kahi Ching, and Solomon Enos directed the youth in the basics of line, form, color, and proportion. The workshops, sponsored by Kalihi Ahupuaa Ulu Pono Ahahui (KAUPA), will culminate in the painting of the mural in October.</p>

<p>The Kalihi Waena wall mural will be the first of a series of murals to be painted along Kalihi Stream. KAUPA surveyed the community and held a public meeting on July 9 to find out what residents would like to see in the mural. Initial responses include scenes of nature and a representation of the various ethnicities of Kalihi. </p>

<p>The volunteer artists, under the guidance of the master artists, will study the history of Kalihi and use the opinions of the community to create the design for the mural.</p>

<p>Spaces are still available for artists who are interested in attending the workshops and painting the mural. KAUPA is looking for volunteers aged 14 and above who live, work, play, and love Kalihi. </p>

<p>To volunteer, contact Marissa at kaupa2create@yahoo.com. Workshops will take place on August 21, September 4, and September 25, with painting of the mural happening in the first week of October.</p>

<p>KAUPA is a nonprofit, community-based organization centered in Kalihi Valley with the goal of instilling an environmental ethic of caring for the land  in Kalihi. KAUPA provides environmental education opportunities and activities within the community and embraces both the traditional Hawaiian way of caring for our ahupuaa and the scientific process by advocating a balance in today’s modern challenges with the wisdom of the past.</p>

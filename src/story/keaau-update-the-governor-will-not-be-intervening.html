<p>Donalyn Dela Cruz, Deputy Director of Communications for the Governor&#8217;s office, responded this afternoon to the petition from Kea‘au residents for more time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Governor will not be intervening. </p>

<p>The Abercrombie administration continues to push forward on homelessness initiatives. Hopefully those who do not have family options for immediate assistance will find assistance at a shelter.</p>

<p>You jump on the dance floor shamelessly and start gyrating your hips, flailing your knees and throwing your date around arbitrarily. And you’re getting stink eye. And you deserve it.</p>

<p>Let the 12th annual <a href="http://hispaniceventshawaii.com/salsainparadise.html">Hawaii Summer Salsa in Paradise Festival</a> solve your chorographical woes.&nbsp; Workshops and parties stretched over four days will not only give you the confidence to impress your Hispanic friends but expose you to a host of nationalities through music and dance. </p>

<p>“Believe me, you will learn several of the basic moves in Salsa, Bachata, Merengue,” says Nancy Ortiz, event coordinator and host of the Alma Latina radio show. “And you do not need a partner. It’s people-friendly, even if you are shy. Salsa aloha style!”</p>

<p>The event, which will be held at four different Honolulu venues, will also celebrate El Dia de San Juan, bringing together Hawai‘i’s Puerto Rican community.</p>

<p>The festival is also hosting a qualifying competition for the World Latin Dance Cup with the winner receiving a trip to Miami to represent the 50th state amongst 650 competitors from 40 countries.</p>

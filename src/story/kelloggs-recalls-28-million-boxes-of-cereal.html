HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;Kellogg’s Brand Cereal, the world’s largest cereal company recalled around 28 million cereal boxes across America last week due to various complaints by customers. Cases of nausea and vomiting were reported with 20 customers complaining they noticed a nasty smell coming from the cereal. The cereals with the most recalls are Fruit Loops, Apple Jacks, Pops, and Honey Smacks.</p>

<p>The Kellogg’s franchise said the off-taste and smell is caused by a slightly elevated level of substance commonly present at very low levels in the waxy resins used to make the packaging materials that are approved by the FDA. These substances are commonly used to coat foods such as cheese, raw fruits and vegetables, such as cucumbers. They are also used in packaging materials. Kellogs stated that they did not identify any substances that are not commonly used in packaging materials. </p>

<p>The president of the company, David Mckay, formally apologized to the public for this incident, stating the customer’s health and safety is top priority for the company. To check if you own one of the boxes being recalled, look at the expiration date on the box. The affected boxes are dated March 26, 2011 and June 22, 2011.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Kellogg’s decision comes in a period where other high-profile voluntary recalls have been made by businesses such as McDonalds and Girl Scout cookies. </p>

<p>Kellogg’s reaction to the complaints came quickly with the most affected products coming back in a short amount of time. Still there were concerns about how it was handled. Alina Popescu tweeted on the Everything PR website: “What puzzles me is that the recall has happened on Friday but according to the Examiner.com coverage of the topic, they waited until Sunday to issue a press statement explaining the situation.”</p>

<p><i>Youth News for The Hawaii Independent</i> sent two reporters to grocery stores on Hawaii Island and were unable to find any product dated during the recall time frame.</p>

<p><i>For more information on the topic refer to <a href="http://consumeralert.kelloggs.com/consumeralert.aspx?id=3870" title="http://consumeralert.kelloggs.com/consumeralert.aspx?id=3870">http://consumeralert.kelloggs.com/consumeralert.aspx?id=3870</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>You may also contact the Kellogg Consumer Response Center at the following number: (888) 801-4163. If you find a box of cereal reported in the time zones of affected boxes, contact the company and a full refund will be given.</i></p>

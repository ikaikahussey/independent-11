<p>The KEY Project will hold a community meeting tonight in Windward Oahu to discuss land use and drug issues in the area. The meeting will also celebrate the life of Hawaii sumo wrestler Percy Kipapa, who was stabbed to death in May of 2005 by an ice dealer who had 31 prior arrests and was out on bail at the time of the murder.</p>

<p>The book <i>Big Happiness</i> (UH Press, 2011) seeks to explain how this could have happened, and explores Hawaiiâ€™s past, spanning several decades of recent local history and delving into the multiple causes leading to our current crystal meth epidemic&#8212;causes ranging from the Great Mahele, to the mid-1970s Windward land battles, to the construction of H-3, to the political grandstanding that substituted for real attempts to address Hawaii&#8217;s drug problem throughout the first decade of the millennium.</p>

<p>A celebration of Percy Kipapa and public forum on land-use and drug issues will include speakers from the community and refreshments. The parents, other family, and friends of Kipapa will attend.</p>

<p>The award-winning fourth annual University of Hawaii Kids First! Film Festival returns with four summer Sundays of free family films. This year&#8217;s screenings&#8212;suitable for children ranging in age from 2 to tweens&#8212;include green themes, animations adapted from beloved children&#8217;s literature, plus stories about kids and pets from around the world.</p>

<p>Kids First!, a project of the Coalition for Quality Children&#8217;s Media, is the largest traveling children&#8217;s film festival in the world. Curated locally by UH Manoa&#8217;s Outreach College, Kids First! films are free of gratuitous violence; race, gender, or religious bias; inappropriate content; and condescension towards children. Age-appropriate groupings of films entertain through a balance of animation and live action, plus varied themes from different cultures. To add to the festivities, door prizes are awarded at all screenings. Parents, grandparents, friends and neighborhood kids&#8212;everyone can enjoy the Festival because it&#8217;s juried by kids, parents, teachers, and child advocates nationwide to qualify for the Festival. Perhaps best of all, it&#8217;s free.</p>

<p>The screenings are the following Sundays at 3:00 p.m.in the UH Manoa Art Auditorium:<br />

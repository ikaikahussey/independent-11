<p>MAUI&#8212;The County of Maui Department of Transportation announced today that it is working to resolve the recent delay problems that have plagued the Kihei Islander route.&nbsp; </p>

<p>According to the department, unusual delays have been reported by both riders and Maui Bus drivers. While some of the delays may be due to weather related clean-up in the area, heavy ridership and also the popularity of the $2.00 daily passes may also be adding to the late arrivals. </p>

<p>The Department is currently working to modify the Maui Bus schedule and coordinate with other routes, so that there is no further hardship to the riding public. </p>

<p>Transportation director Jo Anne Johnson said in a statement: &#8220;We are truly sorry for the inconvenience to the public and ask for their patience and understanding while these delay problems are being addressed. We hope that it can be resolved quickly and with a minimum of inconvenience to our loyal riders.&#8221; </p>

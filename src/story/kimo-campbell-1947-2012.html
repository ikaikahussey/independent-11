<p>James Kimo Campbell, progressive philanthropist and early shareholder in the Hawaii Independent, passed away on February 16.</p>

<p>From his obituary in the Marin Independent Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James Kimo Campbell Passed away February 16th, 2012 of complications from ALS. He was 65. </p>

<p>Kimo was born in Los Angeles on February 11, 1947. He was raised in Ewa Beach, Hawaii and attended Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii. He came to Northern California in 1966 and attended the College of Marin and UC Berkeley. He was an active student leader and worked for a time as a journalist for the Marin Independent Journal. Kimo was elected to the Marin Community College Board for four terms in the seventies and eighties and ran a small publishing house, Pueo Press, which specialized in Hawaiiana. </p>

<p>As a philanthropist and activist, he supported numerous community groups over the years through his foundation, the Pohaku Fund, focusing on environmental protection, civil rights and Hawaiian sovereignty and through active board service with a variety of organizations throughout his life. He was also an active political supporter of progressive political candidates across the country. He was a lifelong fan of the University of California Golden Bears, an avid historian and book devourer. </p>

<p>He is survived by his wife, Kerry Tepperman Campbell of San Rafael, his two children, Mahealani Campbell of Sebastopol and Kawika Campbell of San Francisco, and a loving community of friends and family. In lieu of flowers, donations in his name can be made to the Hawaii Community Foundation and/or ACLU of Northern California. The family will hold a private funeral; a memorial for friends and community will be held in the coming months.</p>

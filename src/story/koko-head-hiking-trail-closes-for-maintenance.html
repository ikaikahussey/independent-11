<p>HAWAII KAI &#8212; The Koko Crater Tram Trail, a popular hiking trail along the old tram line on the slopes of Koko Head Crater in East Honolulu, will be closed for maintenance beginning at <br />
5 a.m., Monday, May 2, 2011. </p>

<p>The trail is scheduled to reopen at 5 a.m., Friday, May 6.&nbsp; The trail closure is necessary to remove a 2,000-foot long, ¾” steel wire cable that currently runs the length of the tram’s track.&nbsp; The wire rope, built during World War II, is deteriorating and is being removed as a preventive safety measure. </p>

Much of the current large-scale development proposed is a very old fashion and is based on real estate development, exploiting the land and bringing in thousand of more visitors and visiting students. Modern development would strengthen our Agriculture Sector and supplement it with well-paying 21st Century Media, Film and TV jobs for local community. There are many Agricultural Programs, grants and supports which could strengthen farmers in Koolau Loa. These AG programs include: US Department of Agriculture Programs, Hawaii Agricultural Alliance Programs and even free Ag programs from College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. There are also some young Ag-Entrepreneurs setting-up innovative businesses. How can our community best utilize these resources?’</p>

<p>3. Kam Hwy Upgrades- As a result of Burt Greene’s perseverance, Hauula is now getting some much-needed stripping, on our piece of Kam Highway. Thanks Burt for your advocacy for Hauula!</p>

<p>4. Hauula Elementary School- HES is creating a Home-School Compact; will focus on Hawaiian Values; have revised the wellness policy- will complete assessment and develop a work plan; completed HSA (grade 6-fourth quarter scores went from 1 8%to 25% in reading proficiency and 9% to 31 % in math. HES can provide signage, can put banners on fence. In the future will have electronic marquee. HES has a current Emergency Preparedness Plan and it is practiced throughout the year. Parents should not come down to the school to pick up children. LDS church is the shelter for the school. Not sure yet about principal position. There is a hiring freeze, maybe we will know more in June. HES can always use community volunteers; just call the school to volunteer. The May Day celebration at HES will be May 13 from 9-10:30 AM. All are invited!</p>

<p>5. Hauula Community Park- We have sent an email to Dept of Design and Construction and Dept of Land and Natural Resources and Parks and Rec. to let them know that we would like for them to transfer the land at 54-260 Hauula Homestead Rd. from DLNR to City and County, Parks and Rec. Dept so that it can be developed as an addition to the Hauula Community Park. The current Hauula Community Park is short 6.5 acres according to the state standards for Community Parks. This 5 acre parcel was identified in the Koolauloa Park Master Plan as the number one site for park expansion. It is currently available since a 30-year lease was recently cancelled. This parcel will be sufficient to develop football and soccer fields for our children in Hauula and the Koolauloa area. We are in hopes that this proposal will go before the Land Use Board in June. We have started an online petition and will also do a hard-copy petition. Jessica Wooley offered to write a letter to support our request to have this parcel of land transferred from DLNR to the City and County Parks and Recs Dept so it can be developed as an addition to Hauula Community Park. Thanks Rep. Jessica Wooley.</p>

<p>6. Ahupua’a Initiative- In our April 27th meeting we had a guest speaker, Debbie Gowensmith for the Hawaii Community Stewardship Network. They help to empower communities in Hawaii to improve their quality of life through caring for theft environmental heritage. They can assist us with assessing the condition of our community from ecological to cultural; developing, managing and evaluating projects/activities to ensure they are having the desired impact; and building equitable partnerships. We hope to stay involved with this network. Our next meeting will be on May25th at the Hauula Community Park Building from 6-7:30 PM. Interested folks are welcome!</p>

<p>7. Hau’ula Civic Center Access- The policy that has been shared with us by the City and County (Bryan Mick and Charles Woodward —Facilities Maintenance) is that in order to rent the multi-use room in the Civic Center for community meetings the charge will be $50 for 2 hours and we would need to provide a copy of a liability policy along with the payment. I think we need to keep working on this issue, any suggestions appreciated!</p>

<p>Kuakini Health System (Kuakini) invites the entire community to its 110th Anniversary Celebration in the Hale Pulama Mau Building on Saturday, July 17 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on the Kuakini campus.</p>

<p>The free event will include Rock Wall Climbing; massages from Aisen Shiatsu School and Shiatsu Therapeutic Association of America; a Fun Fitness Challenge; blood pressure checks; breast cancer risk assessments; Derma Scan sun damage screenings; a health expo; and prizes. Event guests will be treated to a variety of giveaways, balloon creations, cake, shave ice, popcorn, and healthy snacks. Parking will be validated.</p>

<p>Kuakini’s roots date back to July 15, 1900 when the Nihonjin Jizenkai (The Japanese Benevolent Society) opened the 38-bed Japanese Charity Hospital for the unfortunate, sick and injured Japanese citizens in Hawaii who were without family or friends. Today, Kuakini provides services for all ethnicities. Kuakini is committed to meeting the needs of the community through comprehensive acute medical, surgical and emergency services and long term care. In honor of Kuakini’s milestone anniversary and long commitment to Hawaii’s communities, Mayor Mufi Hannemann, proclaimed July 2010 as Kuakini Health System Month.</p>

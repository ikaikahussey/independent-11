<p>Last Thursday, University of Hawaiʻi Board of Regents member Benjamin Kudo called for a halt on new construction projects on University of Hawaiʻi campuses. Kudo is concerned that spending on new projects is affecting the University&#8217;s ability to maintain the rest of its buildings. </p>

<p>And he couldn&#8217;t be more right. The University is currently sitting on a repair and maintenance backlog of $487 million, of which 80 percent is at the flagship Mānoa campus.</p>

<p>Two expensive and ongoing construction projects, the Campus Center Renovation and Expansion Project ($46.5 million) and the Information Technology Center ($43 million ), are also taking place on the Mānoa campus. </p>

<p>Students and faculty have often wondered why UHM&#8217;s Campus Center (CC) is being renovated while classrooms across the campus sit in various states of disrepair and obsolescence. In fact, CC has a totally separate charter from the rest of UHM and planned their renovations separately from the rest of the campus Capitol Improvement Projects (CIPs).</p>

<p>Meanwhile buildings across the campus, from the dance facilities down in lower campus, to Kuykendall Hall, the 80,000 square foot epicenter for the Humanities, sit in disrepair.</p>

<p>Kuykendall Hall has been in bad shape for years. Professors and students alike have had to deal with a host of concerning wears and tears on the building including mold, broken air-conditioners, ground termites, asbestos-filled fire-doors (since removed) and a suspicious rate of breast-cancer and other illnesses within the English Department.</p>

<p>“The building has a long and sad history of neglect and poor retro-fitting,” said UHM English Professor Steve Canham. “We&#8217;re the core of the University, but the image of this building—what it tells the visiting students and their parents—who would want to come take classes in this building?”</p>

<p>“With all the sustainability projects system-wide, you&#8217;d think this one, which is national-level, would be at the forefront,” agreed fellow English Professor Kristin  McAndrews. </p>

<p>McAndrews is referring to a long-standing <a href="http://manoa.hawaii.edu/chancellor/sustainability/projects/Kuy_Monitoring.pdf">CIP plan</a> to repair Kuykendall and transform it into a model for sustainable architecture, planning and design. This CIP is separate from the building&#8217;s needed repairs in the backlog, but would have taken care of those issues as well. </p>

<p>Would have, because the plan has stalled out over a lack of funding from the Legislature, according to Director of the UH Center for Smart Building and Community Design, and Interim Assistant Vice Chancellor for Physical, Environmental &amp; Long Range Planning, Steve Meder.</p>

<p>“As CIP projects came out in the Legislature this past session, Kuykendall didn&#8217;t get funded,” said Meder. “But Chancellor Apple wants to continue to pursue funding for it. It&#8217;s too bad, because this is a real, meaningful project that could be an engine of change and opportunity in the state.”</p>

<p>Canham agrees. “This was a chance to do it right; to really put UH on the sustainable map,” he said.</p>

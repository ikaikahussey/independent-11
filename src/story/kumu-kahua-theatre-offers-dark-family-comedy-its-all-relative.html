<p>DOWNTOWN &#8212; Kumu Kahua Theatre presents Hawaii playwright Edward Sakamoto&#8217;s<em> It&#8217;s All Relative</em> beginning Thursday, May 26, running until June 26. Sakamoto&#8217;s previous works, <em>Stew Rice</em> and<em> Aloha Las Vegas</em> met with wide critical acclaim.</p>

<p><em>It&#8217;s All Relative</em> is a dark comedy that explores relationships within the Miyamoto family. Happy and stable on the surface, the Miyamotos reveal a collapsing marriage, sibling rivalry, resentment, regret, and a midlife crisis. It&#8217;s a telling portrait of a local family, each and all struggling with lingering issues in modern Hawaii.</p>

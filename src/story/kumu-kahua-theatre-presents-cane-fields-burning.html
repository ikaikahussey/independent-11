<p>DOWNTOWN &#8212; Kumu Kahua Theatre presents <em>Cane Fields Burning</em>, winner of the Kumu Kahua/UH Manoa playwriting contest, beginning Thursday for a month-long run of shows ending on October 9. The show goes on Thursdays through Sundays.</p>

<p>Ghosts, demons, and dark memories haunt Hawai‘i’s plantation fields in the tale of a curse passed down through three generations.&nbsp; An old man has died, and as his son and grandson sort through his belongings, the photograph of a beautiful woman exposes the violent secret buried in the old man’s past. <em>Cane Fields Burning</em> uses the elegant power of Japanese Noh theatre to tell the story of a family struggling to escape its tortured history. The play contains adult content.</p>

<p>Kumu Kahua Artistic Director, Harry Wong, directs the play, with Katherine Aumer as Assistant Director.&nbsp; The cast includes acclaimed local actors Stu Hirayama, Shiro Kawai, Wil T.K. Kahele, Evelyn Leung, Justin Fragiao, Jaime Bradner, Elexis Draine, Lisa Ann Katagiri Bright and Danielle Zalopany.</p>

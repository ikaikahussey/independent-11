<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Youth throughout the state started work last week for the Hawaii Youth Conservation Corps Summer Program (HYCC). After a weeklong training camp that took place on Oahu, nearly 150 youth will be spending the rest of their summer working with conservation organizations throughout Hawaii.</p>

<p>HYCC’s Summer Program teaches youth life skills and provides the opportunity to earn college credits, a stipend, and an educational award. This summer, HYCC teams are hard at work on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Hawaii, Lanai, and Molokai.</p>

<p>Kupu, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that administers the HYCC programs, partners with  various organizations statewide in order to provide youth with a hands on learning experience in the field of conservation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This year Kupu saw nearly 900 applications for the 150 available positions for the summer program. Each week teams of 10-12 work with different organizations at different locations, working to help restore and preserve Hawaii’s natural resources. Participants apply for one of two types of positions, members and team leaders, and typically range in age from 15-24 years old. The 2010 Summer Program has 15 teams statewide working alongside and learning from conservation managers, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Forestry and Wildlife, Kahoolawe Island Reserve Commission, and other agencies.</p>

<p>HYCC participants work with different organizations at sites that are not always accessible to the general public, including a trip to Kahoolawe.&nbsp; They work on various projects including invasive species removal and management, native outplanting, wetland restoration and trail maintenance.&nbsp; Participants also gain cultural knowledge and a greater appreciation for Hawaii and its natural resources. HYCC’s programs teach youth the importance of conservation, while helping them to develop vital life skills, and become the next generation of natural resource managers.</p>

<p>“HYCC is an important program in the community,&#8221; said Lisa Schattenburg-Raymond of Maui Nui Botanical Gardens. &#8220;It encourages our youth to get involved in shaping the communities that they are a part of. It helps these students find a depth of knowledge through more dimensions than a book can lend. Hands-on experience with culturally-significant areas and things bring about change through education and responsibility.”</p>

<p><i>HYCC teams will be working throughout the state until July 23. For more information about Kupu, visit <a href="http://www.kupuhawaii.org" title="www.kupuhawaii.org">www.kupuhawaii.org</a>.</i></p>

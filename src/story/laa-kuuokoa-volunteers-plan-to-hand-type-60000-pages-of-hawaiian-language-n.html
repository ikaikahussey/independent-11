<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Over 3,000 volunteers are expected to help make 60,000 pages of Hawaiian language newspapers available to the world via the Internet on this Lā Kū‘oko‘a, Hawaiian Independence Day.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people from the Native Hawaiian community, schools, and organizations are expected to attend the launch of the ‘Ike Kū‘oko‘a Initiative on Monday, November 28 from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at ‘Iolani Palace.</p>

<p>The initiative is spearheaded by Awaiaulu, Inc., a local non-profit organization, which is seeking 3,000 volunteers from around the world to make 60,000 pages of Hawaiian-language newspapers accessible online.</p>

<p>Participants are asked to come with their laptops to join in the initiative. Limited laptops will be available on site for attendees to register online and begin hand-typing pages of Hawaiian language newspapers. In support of the launch, Sprint Hawaii will be on site to provide WiFi access. Knowledge of Hawaiian language is not required to participate. Volunteers can register online at <a href="http://www.awaiaulu.org" target="_blank">www.awaiaulu.org</a>.</p>

<p>“The importance of this volunteer effort cannot be understated,” said Kumu Hula Kealiʻi Reichel, who is supporting the initiative. “This project will shed further light on the thoughts, emotions and ‘ike of our kūpuna, and provide another connective thread past and present.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://thehi.tv/topics/ike-kuokoa-initiative">‘Ike Kū‘oko‘a Initiative</a> is funded by organizations such as Pūʻā Foundation, Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Kamehameha Schools, Hawai‘inuiākea: Center for Hawaiian Knowledge, U.H. Sea Grants Hawai‘i, and numerous civic clubs and hālau in Hawai‘i and abroad.</p>

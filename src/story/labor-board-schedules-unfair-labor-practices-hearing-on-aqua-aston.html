<p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a complaint today against Aqua-Aston Hospitality in response to five unfair labor practice charges filed by UNITE HERE Local 5 against Aqua-Aston (formerly Aston Hotels &amp; Resorts) since July. The charges include allegations that Aqua-Aston unlawfully threatened and discriminated against workers for engaging in lawful union activity, even going so far as to discipline two workers and terminate one.<br />
 <br />
In April, the NLRB issued a complaint against Aqua-Aston for eight additional unfair labor practice charges. Local 5 alleged that Aqua-Aston violated federal labor law by intimidating and harassing workers at the Aston Waikiki Beach and Hotel Renew. Aston agreed to settle these allegations by posting notices in the hotels committing that the hotels “will not threaten [employees] with adverse job consequences if [they] engage in union or other protected and concerted activities.”<br />
 <br />
The new complaint alleges several instances where Aqua-Aston management continued to threaten workers for engaging in union activities, even after it agreed to a settlement in April promising to cease these unlawful threats.<br />
 <br />
Edgar DeGuzman, a maintenance worker at Aston Waikiki Beach, says he received a written warning just for mentioning the union.<br />
 <br />
“This isn’t right. The hotel posted these notices, and then I got disciplined just for talking about the union. I am happy to hear that the NLRB is going to schedule a hearing,” said DeGuzman.<br />
 <br />
Another charge alleges that Gary Ettinger, Executive Vice President of Operations, “threatened employees with the loss of their jobs for engaging in union and/or protected concerted activities.”<br />
 <br />
The NLRB complaint notifies both Aqua-Aston and Local 5 that a hearing will take place starting February 2, 2016.<br />
 <br />
Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is owned by Xenia Hotels and Resorts (NYSE:XHR), a recently spun-off affiliate of Inland American Real Estate Trust Inc.</p>

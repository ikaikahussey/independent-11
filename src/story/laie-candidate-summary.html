<p>The La&#8217;ie Community Association&#8217;s Candidate Forum that was held last night (Tuesday August 7) went fairly well despite a few glitches. Two of the three candidates for House District 47 did not receive the 15 prepackaged questions before the start of the forum. This turned out to be a good thing for the audience as we were able to see how good Gil Riviere and Richard Fale are at impromptu reasoning. Gil did well, Richard was almost adequate.<br />
Most of the questions were regarding development in and around La&#8217;ie which was expected. However, the subject that created the most buzz was a question on rail. When an audience member submitted the question &#8220;What is your position on rail?&#8221; In answering, both Richard Fale and Ululani Beirne danced around the question without revealing their support or lack of support for this project. An audience member pressed candidate Fale for a yes or no and he replied that &#8220;The voters will ultimately decide this matter either on the 11th of this month or in the November general election. When it was his turn, Representative Riviere replied that although he supports the concept of rail, he cannot support the current rail proposal as it is now being implemented and therefore cannot support it. The room broke into the most vigorous applause of the evening. <br />
No knock out blows - but Representative Riviere drew the most positive response from the audience and may have carried the evening.</p>

<p>In regards to Senator Hee&#8217;s and Colleen Myers&#8217; turn at the podium. This was a total mismatch. Senator Hee answered questions clearly, confidently, and added legal decisions and constitutional references for extra measure. While gaining some support in staunch republican town of La&#8217;ie over issues like same sex marriage, former House District 47 Representative Myers may have lost some backing from the contingent of native Hawaiians when she stated that &#8220;I do not now nor have I ever supported any rendition of the Akaka Bill.&#8221; Despite the flaws in this piece of legislation, Meyer&#8217;s non-support of some form or any form of reparations or entitlements that benefit indigenous Hawaiians was a real eye opener. <br />
A clear hands down win for Senator Hee.</p>

<p>This is just my take on the event and obviously the voters will decide on August 11th and then again in November. </p>

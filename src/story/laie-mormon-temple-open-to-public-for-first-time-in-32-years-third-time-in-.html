<p>LAIE&#8212;For the first time in 32 years, the Laie Hawaii Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints will be open to the public for seven days from October 22 to November 13. The open house marks the end of a thorough 18 month-long renovation, one of the only circumstances that leads to a temple’s opening to the public, and as well as to its rededication, which will take place on November 21. </p>

<p>“Once a temple is dedicated, only members of the church who are in good standing are allowed to go in,” Dennis Drake, the media representative for the event said on Monday. He added, “This is only the third time the Laie temple has been open to the public since it was built in 1919, 91 years ago.” </p>

<p>According to the Church, the restoration project refurbished both the interior and exterior of the temple and is the “most comprehensive effort since 1978” when the church was last opened to the public. <a href="http://Mormontemples.com" title="Mormontemples.com">Mormontemples.com</a> describes temple dedication as a time when members of Church offer the building to God. According to the site, the temple must be dedicated before any ordinances can take place in it and those who attend the dedication must have obtained a “temple recommend” through an interview with the bishop of their congregation, certifying their worthiness.</p>

<p>“It has been 32 years since we’ve been privileged to invite guests into our place of worship,” said Hawaii Area Seventy Elder, Scott D. Whiting in a statement. “For many, this is an opportunity of a lifetime and we are excited to invite the people of Hawaii to view this magnificent temple.”</p>

<p>Built in 1919, the Laie temple serves approximately 50,000 church members living on Oahu and Kauai. The temple’s total floor area measures approximately 47,224 square feet, according to <a href="http://ldschurchtemples.com" title="ldschurchtemples.com">ldschurchtemples.com</a> and was the first temple built in Polynesia.</p>

<p>“The open house is for any of the public to view it and to ask questions,” said Drake.</p>

<p><i>Prior to rededication, visitors can join tours starting at the temple visitor center that include a 12-minute video presentation and a 25-minute walking tour through the temple. Visitors are invited to tour the temple during the open house daily, except Sundays, from October 22 to 30 from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., November 1 from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., November 2 to 6 from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., November 8 from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and November 9 to 13 from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The Church said that although open visitation is available during the open house, reservations are preferred and can be made by calling 1-866-537-8457 or online at <a href="http://www.lds.org/reservations" title="www.lds.org/reservations">www.lds.org/reservations</a>.</i></p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Public Lands Development Corporation, a brand-new state corporation charged with developing public lands, will meet for the first time on Monday, August 29 at 2:30 p.m. in the Kalanimoku Building.</p>

<p>This inaugural meeting was originally planned for last week, but was hastily cancelled because it didn&#8217;t meet state open access laws, according to a report by <a href="http://www.environment-hawaii.org/">Environment Hawaii</a>.</p>

<p>What to look for in this meeting: item VII on the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/meetings/PLDC-agenda-110822.pdf">agenda</a>, dealing with the &#8220;Public Land Optimization Plan,&#8221; and item VIII, a discussion of potential projects for development.</p>

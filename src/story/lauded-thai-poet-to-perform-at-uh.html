<p>MANOA&#8212;Thailand’s award-winning free verse poet <a href="http://zakariyaamataya.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Zakariya Amataya</a> will perform at UH Manoa’s Orvis Auditorium for Rhyme and Reason, presented in conjunction with Shangri La: Center for Islamic Arts and Culture. As a winner of the prestigious Southeast Asia Write Award, Amataya is the first Muslim recipient from Thailand.</p>

<p>The son of illiterate farmers, Zakariya Amataya was born in 1975 in Narathiwat province, one of Thailand`s three Muslim-majority southern provinces. Amataya`s poetry often pulls from the struggles associated with this part of Southeast Asia. Though his poetry is written in the Thai language, he grew up speaking a dialect of Malay. Amataya studied Arabic language, literature and Islam at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama in India, where he discovered his passion for poetry. He is now completing an M.A. in comparative religion at Mahidol Unviersity in Bangkok. </p>

<p>Also performing will be Hawaii poet <a href="http://www.kealohapoetry.com/" target="_blank">Kealoha</a>, who has been recognized internationally and has performed all over the world, including Switzerland, Brazil, New York, and Chicago. He is the founder of HawaiiSlam, Youth Speaks Hawaii, and First Thursdays, which is the world’s largest registered slam poetry competition.</p>

<p>In addition, ukulele virtuoso <a href="http://taimane.com/" target="_blank">Taimane Gardner</a>, who is acclaimed for her fast, electric style of playing. Influenced by world famous musician Jake Shimabukuro, Gardnered met Don Ho at age 13 and became a part of the legendary performer’s stage show. She now performs regularly all over Hawaii.</p>

<p>Kealoha and Amataya will also perform a series of shows at selected State libraries on Oahu.</p>

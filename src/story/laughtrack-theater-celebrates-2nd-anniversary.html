<p>Laughtrack Theater Company on Bethel Street in Chinatown, Hawaii’s only improvisational Comedy Theater, turns two years old on Saturday, September 4.</p>

<p>During uncertain economic times, weathering the highs and lows of operating a new business is an enormous challenge. Fortunately for co-owners Shannon Winpenny and Kim Potter, they have enjoyed the support of the Chinatown Arts District community, as well as their students, friends, and family to help make their second year indeed successful. To show thanks, Laughtrack Theater is throwing a birthday party to include a power house line-up of improv comedy ensembles on this very special Saturday.</p>

<p>The birthday celebration welcomes the debut of <b>Meryle Necklace.</b> A sight to behold, Meryle Necklace members vary in size, between 5’1” and 6’3” and have uncommon wit and preternatural comedic instinct. Each member has been carefully taught to use a variety of improvisational skills, which give the performance a fine detail, definition, and contrast to the Harold form of improv, in true signature Laughtrack fashion. As with the entire cast of performers, each member of Meryle Necklace has been trained and polished, which took months upon months of effort and energy under the watchful eye and tutelage of Artistic Director Shannon Winpenny. </p>

<p><b>Peas, Braines, and Burritos</b> will be performing the Fishbone. This is a comedic form based upon the nature of cause and effect. Upon providing the suggestion for the performance, the audience can sit back and enjoy a journey as each scene that is performed causes the next to be created.</p>

<p><b>Aftermath</b>, Laughtrack Theater’s longest-running performance ensemble, is an experimental two-person that show exposes what happens after an event suggested by the audience. It explores offbeat characters, relationships, themes, ideas, and philosophies, while telling the story of what happens when two people have to deal with the aftermath. Co-owner Shannon Winpenny will be joined by special guest improv artist Larissa Nielsen.</p>

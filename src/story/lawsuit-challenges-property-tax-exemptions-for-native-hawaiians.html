<p>HONOLULU &#8212; H. William Burgess, long known for his involvement in lawsuits challenging native Hawaiian entitlements, is now involved in a lawsuit challenging property tax exemptions for native Hawaiians. The lawsuit was filed on September 15.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-336.htm" target="_blank"><em>CORBOY v. LOUIE</em></a> objects to the fact that petitioners (who are non-native Hawaiians) pay significantly more in property taxes than native Hawaiians living on homestead lands. The petitioners assert that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_v._Cayetano" target="_blank"><em>RICE v. CAYETANO</em></a>, in which the Supreme Court ruled that “native Hawaiian” is a racial classification, and is therefore unconstitutional under the 15th amendment as a voting eligibility requirement. The lawsuit extrapolates that ruling to deem biased taxation based on race as similarly unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In an email to local news media, Aloha for All, Inc., a non-profit organization, says “The use of such a destructive power by the state and counties to discriminate between homeowners based solely on their racial ancestry, destroys the concept of equal protection at its most direct and basic level.”&nbsp; </p>

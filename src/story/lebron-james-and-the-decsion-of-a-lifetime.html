By now we all know the outcome of Lebron James&#8217; decision, which has in turn changed him from hometown hero to villain of the NBA. If you were able to catch the hour-long nauseating ESPN special, “The Decision,” and didn’t fall asleep or walk way last week, Lebron announced to the world that he was taking his talent to the South Beach of Miami. It might sound like a great deal for James&#8212;to pack up from cold Cleveland and head south to the vacation destination, where there is publicity, stars, and more ways to get in trouble. At the same time he is leaving the franchise he started his NBA career with seven years ago, disappointing legions of fans that stuck by his side hoping to bare “witness” to the greatest player to take the court since Michael. </p>

<p>Many fans, players, coaches, and executives question his choice of Miami, joining all-stars Dwane Wayde and newly acquired Chris Bosh from Toronto. James had far better options to make himself a name without the big names helping him. Teams in pursuit of James included the New Jersey Nets, where he could of resurrected a franchise; the New York Knicks, to play in Madison Square Garden, the greatest stage of basketball; the Chicago Bulls, to follow in Jordan’s footsteps; or even remain in Cleveland and continue to be the hometown hero. </p>

<p>In retrospect of James&#8217; decision, former NBA retired all-star Charles Barkely summed things up best.</p>

<p>“In fairness, if I was 25, I&#8217;d try to win it by myself. Not technically by myself, but I would want to be the guy. ... LeBron is never going to be the guy, ” said Barkely on NBA TV. </p>

<p>According to ESPN polls, the rest of the United States agrees with Barkely: 59 percent of the nation agreed that they like Lebron less now since his Miami decision and 51 percent agreed that the Lakers would be likely to repeat as NBA champions this upcoming season compared to the 39 percent that voted for Miami. </p>

<p>Lebron’s decision was based off his past seven season with the Cavs. Every season, the franchise brought James a good, but not great, supporting cast. As he carried his team to back to back best record seasons in the NBA and scoring the MVP title these last year two years, he could not make it to the NBA finals. Lebron decided it was time to move. So he looked toward Miami, eyes set on surrounding himself with players that would hopefully get him a bit further than before.</p>

<p>Decision aside, what disappointed many NBA fans, broadcasters, and analysts is the spectacle he drew immediately after the Cavaliers exit of the NBA playoffs. While the playoffs continued, the media quickly turned attention to James and what his future held. </p>

<p>“What upsets me the most is they talked about Lebron so much right after their loss, that it took away from the playoffs, which was way more important. He just handled it all wrong and didn’t do it respectfully,” said David Lane, a Hawaii resident and Radford High School girl’s basketball coach. </p>

<p>Loved or now hated, Lebron will play for the Heat next season in his continuous chase for his first championship ring. And as everyone finally moves past the big “decision,” the nation and probably the world will tune into next season to see if it was worth even all the hype.&nbsp; </p>

<p>That’s it for now. Don’t forget to go for a run, swim, hike, play a pick-up game or just get out of your office, if you have one. Enjoy Hawaii and being healthy!</p>

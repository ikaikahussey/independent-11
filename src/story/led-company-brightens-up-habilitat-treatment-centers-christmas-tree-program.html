<p>KANEOHE&#8212;HolidayLEDs.com, an internet retailer based in Jackson, Michigan, will be making donations to Habilitat, a long-term residential substance abuse treatment center located in Kaneohe. </p>

<p>Founded in 1971, the nonprofit organization is based on the Therapeutic Community Treatment Model and is regarded as one of the nation&#8217;s most effective treatment organizations. Habilitat&#8217;s program, which focuses on empowering its participants to choose not to use drugs (rather than treating addiction as a disease) boasts a 52 percent success rate. The relative high rate of success is attributed to Habilitat&#8217;s vocational training programs, which give its participants the skills they need to succeed in the world without drugs or alcohol.</p>

<p>Because Habilitat is a nonprofit organization, it relies heavily and donations and fundraising programs to provide funding to support its programs. Habilitat raises money by hosting luau, operating car washes, selling books and CDs, and by operating an annual Christmas tree sale. </p>

<p>“The annual Christmas tree program is a great fundraising event for us and helps us earn more than $350,000 annually,” said Daniel Edwards of Habilitat. Each year Habilitat sells over 2500 Christmas trees through its two retail lots and over 52 affiliated school fundraising programs. All of the money raised through the programs goes back to the affiliated school fund raising programs or to Habilitat. </p>

<p>“We are able to fund a lot of individuals for rehabilitation and pay for several program events with the money we raise through the Christmas tree program,” Edwards added.</p>

<p>This year Habilitat hopes to attract additional attention and prospective customers to its two retail lots by improving its holiday decorations. </p>

<p>The Christmas lights donated by HolidayLEDs.com will be used to decorate Christmas trees at Habilitat&#8217;s two retail lots in Honolulu on November 27.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; Tripler Army Medical Center’s Fisher House and Kapua Productions are teaming up with Indigo Ultralounge for “Metal Mana,” an open air festival at the end of Nuuanu Avenue in Downtown on Saturday to honor Hawaii’s fallen heroes and provide support for their families.</p>

<p>The event stage will feature Kapena, Natural Vibrations, Eight O Eight, Big Dawg, Danny Estocado, and the “world’s greatest” Led Zeppelin tribute band Led Zepplica. That band has toured the world for years, with a massive fan base that continues to go wild for the authenticity of the music and mannerisms Led Zepplica recreates. Their several past Honolulu shows at the now defunct Pipeline Café were sellouts</p>

<p>Street Grindz food wagons, Liquid Pleasures and Indigo will provide food for the event, and Budweiser and a variety of spirits will also be on hand.</p>

<p>A Metal art build-off and display will also be featured, along with a Miss Metal Mana bikini contest with $1500 going to the winner.</p>

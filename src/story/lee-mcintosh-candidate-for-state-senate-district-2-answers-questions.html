<p><b>Why are you running for office?</b><br />
I am running for office because it is a great opportunity to further serve my community.</p>

<p><b>What is the single most important issue for your constituents?</b><br />
I believe the biggest problem in my district is the lack of local jobs. Most individuals have to drive to Hilo or Kona to work every day.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
I will work with the Legislature to create an environment that is favorable to local businesses by reducing onerous regulations. This will result in the creation of more businesses and jobs. Not raising taxes and fees will allow businesses to retain their current employees, and eventually encourage the hiring of new employees.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
Friends, Republicans, and my immediate family.</p>

<p><b>Who do you plan on including in your staff?</b><br />
I am focusing on getting elected first.</p>

<p><b>What’s your strategy in dealing with the &#8220;homeless&#8221;?</b><br />
The Legislature can create an economy in which it is easier for churches, businesses, and individuals to reach out and minister to the &#8220;homeless&#8221; by not raising taxes or fees and streamlining onerous regulations. After the budget has been balanced, only then should the Legislature look at how taxes can be cut to provide relief to families and businesses, which will enable them to share with others.</p>

<p><b>What’s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
This is a county issue.</p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for House Bill 444?</b><br />
I would have voted against HB444 because 69.2 percent of voters in 1998 passed a constitutional amendment limiting marriage between a man and a woman. Civil unions is a step towards instituting homosexual marriage. There are already State and federal laws that allow these individuals to obtain the legal benefits and protections that they desire. There is not a need for a civil unions bill.</p>

<p><b>Do you support the Akaka Bill?</b><br />
This is a federal issue that only applies to the Governor if it is passed.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
Repealing onerous regulations for campaign contributions, reporting, and becoming a candidate.</p>

<p>Repealing public funding because it further discourages interaction between candidates and constituents.</p>

<p>Elected officials can engage their constituents in solutions to problems facing the community and keep them informed on progress through talk stories.<br />
Create a high school program where elected officials help teach our high school students how the County and State government works, and the importance of participation and voting.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii’s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Not raising taxes and fees.</p>

<p><b>How do we solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem?</b><br />
Creating an environment that is favorable to local businesses will help solve unemployment. The most important issue is not raising taxes or fees. Raising taxes is a devastating, short sighted solution that hurts businesses, the only true solution to unemployment. Repealing onerous regulations that make it difficult to start or operate a business will also help.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Another issue to seriously consider is to repeal the HRS that requires businesses to offer health insurance to their employees. This discourages small businesses from growing by hiring new workers, and also places a burden on employees by reducing their earnings with health insurance that they may not necessarily need. Employees should be given the option to purchase their own health insurance which will allow them to keep it when they leave their employer. These are just some of the many solutions that the Legislature can consider to solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem.</p>

<p><b>What do you mean by stating &#8220;upholding the definition of marriage&#8221; as your platform?</b><br />
I was trying to state positively my opposition to civil unions and homosexual marriage in a way that would be easily understandable by my constituents to make it clear where I stand on the issues.</p>

<p><b>How do you feel about the veto of House Bill 444?</b><br />
I believe that the governor did the right thing in upholding the provision for repealing the State Constitution.</p>

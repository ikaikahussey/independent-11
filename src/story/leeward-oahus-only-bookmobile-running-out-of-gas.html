<p>AIEA&#8212;One of Hawaii&#8217;s best resources for literacy has run out of gas&#8212;literally. Hawaii Literacy&#8217;s Bookmobile, or Classroom on Wheels, currently has more than 200,000 miles, major oil leaks and other mechanical problems that forced it last month to halt this much-needed service. Each year Leeward Oahu&#8217;s only Bookmobile offers thousands of children homework help, reading programs, and other activities to encourage literacy.</p>

<p>In 2009 alone, 1,092 children visited the Classroom on Wheels and more than 15,000 books were checked out. Until recently, Hawaii Literacy&#8217;s Bookmobile visited the Nanakuli Teen Center and Boys and Girls Club, the Waianae Boys and Girls Club, and three transitional housing centers: Kauiokalani, Maililand and Ohana Ola O Kahumana each week. It also provided service to seven preschools in the Koolauloa area on the Windward side. In a survey conducted by Hawaii Literacy, 95 percent of parents felt that the bookmobile helped their children&#8217;s reading skills.</p>

<p>&#8220;In honor of National Bookmobile Day April 14, we wanted to let people know how much our program impacts the children of Oahu. Our Classroom on Wheels gives these kids something to look forward to each week, while fostering literacy in a population where better literacy is sorely needed,&#8221; said Megan Naihe, Hawaii Literacy&#8217;s Classroom on Wheels Program coordinator. &#8220;Thing for me its amazing to see kids face light up when I show up, I have a whole group waiting for me to pull up, so excited to see them excited and it&#8217;s not the manapua man it&#8217;s the bookmobile.&#8221; </p>

<p>Hawaii Literacy received the current Bookmobile in 2007, but it already had 200,000 miles on it and the engine is now not repairable. Hawaii Literacy would like to obtain a 21-passenger van, or a converted handi-shuttle or regular shuttle with less than 85,000 miles on it. Likewise, Hawaii Literacy could revive the existing Bookmobile if someone is willing to donate a new engine for the current van, a Ford E350.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our goal right now is to get a really good reliable van. We have everything else planned out, we have people that will do the interior for us. Aloha Petroleum has set us up with the first two years worth of gas, we just need to get a van, said Naihe.</p>

<p>Supporters can join the Hawaii Literacy cause or donate via <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/456217" title="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/456217">http://apps.facebook.com/causes/456217</a>. Meanwhile, cash donations toward a new Bookmobile can be made at all five Hawaii Self Storage locations (Kaimuki, Salt Lake, Pearl City, Mililani, and Kapolei). A strong proponent of literacy through its Lockers for Literacy program, Hawaii Self Storage provides 5,000 free books, theirs to keep, each year to local public first graders. Hawaii Self Storage is also accepting donations of new or gently used books and educational games for Hawaii Literacy&#8217;s Bookmobile.</p>

<p>Hawaii Literacy offers a multitude of programs aimed at promoting literacy for adults and children alike in the islands. Since 1971, Hawaii Literacy has helped thousands of adults learn the basic reading and writing skills to get better jobs, improve their parenting skills, and succeed in life. Programs include Adult Literacy programs on Oahu and Kauai; the popular Bookmobile (&#8220;Classroom on Wheels&#8221;) Program, which offers books, literacy-related activities, and computer use to low-income families on the Waianae Coast; a Family Literacy program founded in 1990 that provides services to Kalihi area housing projects; an ESL program offering small classes to adults in the Kalihi housing projects; and an Adult Literacy Drop-in Center in Kalihi for adult students who have various literacy needs and/or are seeking ESL instruction. Hawaii Literacy is seeking to expand its services to people on all of the islands; the emphasis is on working with the under-served adult population. </p>

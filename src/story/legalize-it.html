<p>The new bill â€“ <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=699">HB 699</a> allows for personal use of pot, and creates licenses for the growth and sale of marijuana.</p>

<p>And yes: this would allow for general excise taxes to be collected on these herbal transactions.</p>

<p>The Associated Press quotes House Minority Leader Rep. Aaron Ling Johanson, as saying that <a href="http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/Hawaii-lawmakers-want-to-legalize-marijuana/G73hHvEVWEqW-66_jh62_w.cspx">legalization may increase crime rates</a>. Recent results in California provide a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/28/california-marijuana-decriminalization-_n_2205997.html">different conclusion</a>, however.</p>

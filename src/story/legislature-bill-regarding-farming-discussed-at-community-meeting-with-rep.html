<p>HALEIWA&#8212;With only two weeks left in the legislative session, the fates of several bills that would have a direct impact on Hawaii farmers and ranchers are being decided. Leaders in Hawaii&#8217;s agriculture community point to an immediate need for affordable land and longer leases, among other things. Lawmakers think they can help.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, April 20, approximately 15 farmers and ranchers hailing from Punaluu to Kahuku gathered at the Kahuku High School library. The purpose of the nighttime meeting with State Rep. Gil Riviere (R) of District 46 was to discuss the major problems facing Hawaii farmers today and the bills in the Legislature that may address them. </p>

<p>Also in attendance were State Rep. Jessica Wooley (D) of District 47, Junior Primacio of the Koolauloa Neighborhood Board, and several community members. </p>

<p>“We’re here to learn about bills being passed or not passed, and which ones are favorable for famers,” Primacio said at the start of the meeting. </p>

<p>Primacio said major problems around since the 1970s have historically affected farmers on the east and north shores of Oahu, who he described as “the sons of the plantation farmers.” Difficulties in securing affordable ag land, for example, are rooted in a disjointed procedure&#8212;something he said can be resolved through awareness and education.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to somehow get the farmers together,&#8221; Primacio said. &#8220;There are many obstacles, rules, and regulations that need to be known and addressed. Awareness is important.&#8221;</p>

<p>Compounding the issue for farmers is the lack of staff in the State Department of Agriculture. “It&#8217;s lean times in the department and we need to stay viligant,” Riviere said, before summarizing current bills.</p>

<p><b>On protecting land</b></p>

<p>One piece of legislation, <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=227" target="_blank">House Bill 227</a>, would make it easier for farmers to control trespassing, which often leads to damage to property and crops and increases the liability of land owners. Trespassers may also misuse lands as illegal dump sites and places to conduct illicit activities.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Current laws exclude people on unimproved and apparently unused lands from being cited for criminal trespass unless notice of trespass is personally communicated to that person. In many cases, trespassers are armed and located miles from the nearest town or police station. In those situations, giving personal notice is impractical and dangerous. House Bill 227 aims to expand the definition of criminal trespass and to minimize the obstacles involved in citing a trespasser.</p>

<p>One farmer expressed support for House Bill 227, saying that most farmers try to live on their land to protect it from trespassers, but that not all can.</p>

<p>Riviere also described in length <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=1230" target="_blank">House Bill 1230</a>, which would allow farmers to build non-residential structures on agricultural zoned land without a county permit, as long as they build it to code. </p>

<p>Lawmakers said the measure would reduce the start-up and expansion costs incurred by local farmers by allowing the construction of small, low-risk, nonresidential structures used for agricultural or aquacultural operations. Under the bill, farmers would be able to use readily available, low‑cost structures to store materials, equipment, and other supplies while also protecting their assets against inclement weather, vandalism, and theft.</p>

<p>House Bill 1230 received support from the East Oahu County Farm Bureau; Aquaculture Planning and Advocacy LLC; Oceanic Institute; Hawaii Aquaculture and Aquaponics Association; Hawaii Agriculture Research Center; Kunia Water Cooperative; Deeo Blue Research; Hawaii Cattlemen&#8217;s Council; Day2 Resources LLC; Analytical Services Inc.; Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation; Island Harvest Inc.; and six individuals.</p>

<p>On the less favorable end (for farmers) of the legislation spectrum is <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=865" target="_blank">House Bill 865</a>, which would raise insurance fees from 50 cents to 75 cents per 1,000 pounds of cargo&#8212;including seeds, fertilizer, and feed.</p>

<p>“This seems to me grossly unfair,&#8221; Riviere said of House Bill 865, &#8220;when a lot of [farmers&#8217; cargo] is not likely to have invasive species. The majority of invasive species come in on air planes, yet a box of flowers doesn’t weight much.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>The last slaughterhouse</b></p>

<p>Later in the evening, conversation turned to the last slaughter house in operation on Oahu, located in Campbell Industrial Park. <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&amp;billnumber=249" target="_blank">Senate Bill 249</a> would appropriate funds for the State to acquire the slaughter house. </p>

<p>Those in opposition to the acquisition said that it would put the State in direct competition with privately owned slaughterhouses on Maui, Hawaii Island, and Kauai. There are no other government-owned slaughterhouses in the United States. </p>

<p>“My position is, if we’re going to make a go at agriculture, we shouldn’t lose the last slaughterhouse on the island,” Rivere said. </p>

<div class="pull-gold">“We need more land at a cost that we can afford to rent.&#8221;</div>

<p><br />
<b>A tough business</b></p>

<p>Near the end of the meeting, farmers refocused their concerns on how expensive it is to farm equitably.</p>

<p>“It takes me more than one acre to raise one calf,” said a part-time rancher from Punaluu, who explained that he and his wife are only part-time because they both hold day jobs. &#8220;If I need 40 calfs to make it work and hope to expand, 40 acres that each cost $100 month to lease, how can I pull that off?”</p>

<p>He added that because lenders deem the couple “part-time ranchers,” they didn’t qualify for loans and were ask to dip into their home equity.</p>

<p>“We need more land at a cost that we can afford to rent,” said another Kahuku farmer, noting the thousands of acres inland from the coast that go unused each year. He added, “Once a year my property gets completely flooded for two weeks. I&#8217;m going to lose what I have, or just not plant a crop while I wait for it to happen. But it’s nearly impossible to afford to lease more property.”</p>

<p>Most in attendance agreed that longer leases, and more land being made available at affordable prices, are the biggest issue they face.</p>

<p>“We got a lot of farmers out here, we gotta give them the tools. Something’s got to be done,” said Primacio. </p>

<p>Rivere agreed, saying a “a consistent, measured voice” would help.</p>

<p>An issue that closed the meeting was the lack of a food certification facilities for farmers to clean and wash their produce to get “that little green sticker” from the Department of Health. The certification allows farmers to sell their produce directly to larger markets without losing profit to a middle man. Without this, farmers are restricted to selling the produce at flea markets, farmers markets, and Chinatown. </p>

<p>“We can’t do it,&#8221; said a farmer from Kahuku who does not have easy access to certification facilities. &#8220;We just have to sell it cheap to someone else who makes the big bucks after it’s certified.” </p>

<p>In order to get Oahu&#8217;s farmers up to date on the latest legislation, Rivere suggested informational community classes that inform farmers of bills that they may benefit from, and how to take advantage of them. A Punaluu farmer added that classes would need translators for several languages to get the information across to a substantial amount of farmers. Riviere said he would be open to helping the classes become available.</p>

<p>“Unless we help the farmers somehow, someway, the farms are not sustainable,&#8221; Primacio said. &#8220;The reality is farmers might make some money but they cannot survive. One bad crop and they die ... The only reason the plantation survived for so long is that they were sustainable, they had everything the needed. Today, farmers only have one or two tractors, one goes down and they’re jeopardized.” </p>

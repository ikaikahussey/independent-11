<blockquote><p>After discussing a slew of election-related bills this session, lawmakers agreed on a bill that will require political action committees to disclose in all advertisements the names of the top three donors that contributed to the message.</p>

<p>According to the state Campaign Spending Commission, 16 super PACs spent $4.8 million on state and county elections last year — most of which was aimed at the Hono­lulu mayor&#8217;s race, which pitted pro-rail candidate Mayor Kirk Caldwell against anti-rail candidate former Gov. Ben Caye­tano.</p>

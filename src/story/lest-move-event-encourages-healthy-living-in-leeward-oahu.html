<p>MAILI &#8212; The City and County of Honolulu presents <em>E ‘Oni Kâkou, Let’s Move!</em> on Saturday, October 15 from 10 a.m.-2 p.m., at Maili Beach Park. The event is part of a national initiative encouraging Americans to get active by promoting a healthy lifestyle through recreation. The local event features healthy cooking demonstrations, including a session by celebrity chef Grant Kawasaki from OC16’s <em>Hawaiian Grown</em> cooking show. There will be free blood pressure testing and exercise clinics, such as zumba and hot hula. Vendors from Ma‛o Farms and Kahumana Farms will be selling fresh organic produce. </p>

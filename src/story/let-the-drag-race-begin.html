<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Honolulu’s gay pride parades were just teasers to one of the LGBT’s biggest and most festive events of the year, the annual “Universal Showqueen Pageant.” The pageant, which celebrates the “ultimate in the art of female impersonation,” gathers both local and mainland contestants to vie for this prestigious title and over $10,000 worth in cash and prizes.</p>

<p>Co-producer of the pageant Jason Kina says: “We put on this pageant because we’re proud of the transgender and drag community. It gives the contestants a night to shine and come out glamorous. There are a lot of gowns, costumes galore, drama and extravagance.”</p>

<p>This year marks the 27th year for the “Universal Showqueen Pageant,” which takes place  Saturday at 7:00 p.m. (doors open at 6:00 p.m.) and is held at the Hawaii Convention Center. On average, over 1,500 people attend this event and it is expected that there will be 2,000 in attendance this year.</p>

<p>“We thank the contestants, community, and friends and family of the contestants; they really make the pageant.” says Kina.</p>

<p>The Universal Showqueen Pageant is also known to have its share of well-known, local judges. Among the judges, this year, are former KITV Sports Anchor Shawn Ching, Kumu Hula and Entertainer Kealii Reichel, Hawaii News Host Steve Uyehara, T.V. personality Emme Tomimbang, Las Vegas headliner Lani Misalucha, and Miss Hawaii USA 2010 Renee Nobriga. </p>

<p>Comedian Augie T. is slated to host the event.</p>

<p><i>Tickets for the pageant are $50 and can be purchased at Diamond Head Video (Kapiolani location only). For more information on Universal Showqueen, you can call (808) 943-6066 or (808) 372-9350.</i></p>

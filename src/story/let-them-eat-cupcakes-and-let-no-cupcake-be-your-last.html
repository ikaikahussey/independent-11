<p>What do Hawaii journalists do when their big corporate &#8220;mainland-run&#8221; company lays them off? Look for PR jobs. Otherwise, as seen in the latest venture by two talented former <i>Honolulu Advertiser</i> employees, you start a cupcake business ... obviously.</p>

<p>Let Them Eat Cupcakes was founded by Nick Gervais and Kawehi Haug following the great Honolulu newspaper merger of 2010. With some time on their hands, and an opportunity to try something different, the duo decided to take their working relationship from cubicle mates to business partners and cupcake bakers extraordinaire. </p>

<p>They specialize in making gourmet cupcakes in small batches, from real ingredients, all done with a lot of class and a little bit of attitude. The most basic cupcakes come in three flavors: vanilla, double chocolate, and cream cheese-filled red velvet. But they&#8217;ll make cupcakes in just about any flavor you can think of, from haupia to Meyer lemon to chocolate malt.</p>

<p>Be sure to let Let Them Eat Cupcakes let you eat cupcakes the first chance you get. They&#8217;ll be at Slow Art Friday tonight, October 15 from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Pauahi Street in Chinatown. Let no cupcake be your last!</p>

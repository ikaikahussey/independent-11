<p>HONOLULU&#8212;This Father’s Day the Honolulu Academy of Arts’ Bank of Hawaii Family Sunday, a monthly free day of activities and entertainment, focuses on a universal pastime of fathers everywhere: fishing.</p>

<p>The museum, with its tranquil courtyards and lush central lawn, offers a great place to spend a fun day with dad&#8212;for free. Families can take in the jangly Venturesesque sounds of the Surfsonics, see the latest Hasao Miyazaki animated film Ponyo, make gyotaku prints, and go on a gallery hunt for art related to marine life. That’s just the bait&#8212;there’s a lot more to do at Let’s Go Fishing!</p>

<p>When the family gets hungry, everyone can head to the Pavilion Café, which makes kid-friendly food such as hot dogs and sloppy joes just for Bank of Hawaii Family Sunday. And for those who didn’t get dad a gift, The Academy Shop, where artful items can always be found, will be open.</p>

<p>Special guests include Olomana Gardens, which will showcase an aquaponics system that grows fish and plants in one integrated, soilless system, to produce fresh, organic edible fish and vegetables; and the Hawaii Koi &amp; Goldfish Association, which will display live competition fish.</p>

<p>The Bank of Hawaii Family Sunday program now includes a monthly drawing contest. The Academy gives contestants a theme and drawing supplies. The winner receives a $15 gift certificate to The Academy Shop and his or her artwork is used to create the following month’s event brochure and is posted on the Academy website. Last month’s winner was seven-year-old Malia Anderson.</p>

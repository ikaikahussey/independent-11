<p><i>The following is a message from <a href="http://www.defendoahucoalition.org/" target="_blank">Defend Oahu Coalition</a> calling for participation in a protest on October 28 at 4:00 p.m. in front of the Turtle Bay Resort on Kamehameha Highway.</i></p>

<p><br />
The Occupy Wall Street movement has grown into a global hot button issue as more and more concerned world citizens have recognized that institutional corporate greed is largely responsible for the current economic crisis.</p>

<p>This movement, which appears to include folks from all walks of life, has arrived at Hawaii’s idyllic shores with full force.</p>

<p>Groups like “Occupy Oahu,&#8221; “Occupy Honolulu,&#8221; and &#8220;Occupy Magic Island” have formed to voice their common opposition to corporate greed.</p>

<p>Defend Oahu Coalition has been battling corporate greed for the past five-and-a-half years out on the North Shore of Oahu and has been somewhat successful in keeping over-development at bay. Case in point&#8212;the Turtle Bay expansion, which is currently owned by the banks and Wall Street hedgefund managers.</p>

<p>However, the banks and hedgefund managers who now own the 880-acre Turtle Bay property have come for their due and are currently pushing plans to develop a large swath of pristine oceanfront real estate that is home to multiple endangered species. </p>

<p>Defend Oahu Coalition has partnered with Unite Here to voice our opposition to their plan to pave over a large chunk of the North Shore.</p>

<p>If you want to send the banks and hedgefund managers a clear message, join us from 4:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on October 28 in front of Turtle Bay Resort to protest both the project and corporate greed.</p>

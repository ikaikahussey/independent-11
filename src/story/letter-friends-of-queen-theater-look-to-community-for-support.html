<p><i>The following letter is in response to the <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/local/read/Kaimuki/community-comes-together-to-save-the-queen-theater-and-other-historic-kaimu/" title="Queen's Theater article">Queen&#8217;s Theater article</a>, dated April 14, 2010. Please stay tuned for future meetings and events surrounding this issue.</i></p>

<p>Originally formed after the fall of the Varsity Theater, Friends of Queen Theater&#8217;s main focus is to create an organization to focus concerned energy into returning the theater to community use.</p>

<p>We felt from the beginning that the ultimate goal is to see her function again as a venue for live theater, films, concerts, and other events. We also felt that the people of Kaimuki should be the ones to ultimately decide her fate.</p>

<p>The group quickly became an umbrella for many creative ideas and energy from those that had long suffered watching their Queen be unused and neglected.&nbsp; We are lucky that the theater is located in an area where so many talented and concerned citizens are itching to tackle this issue. The Hawaii Theatre, which is now a viable and thriving part of the Renaissance of Chinatown, had to find most of its support outside of the residents. </p>

<p>Currently, we are recording oral histories of past patrons and employees of the Queen that will become part of our application for the Queen&#8217;s status on the State Historic Register. That will lead to a grant financing an architectural proposal for the restoration of the building. We continue to look for ways to communicate with residents and business community members. </p>

<p>Our current 1000 Friends of the Queen Campaign gives everyone interested an opportunity to show their support of the project.

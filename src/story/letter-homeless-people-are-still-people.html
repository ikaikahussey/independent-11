<p><i>The following letter is in response to the story &#8220;<a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/20110717_Roundup_of_homeless_feared_during_APEC.html" target="_blank">Roundup of homeless feared during APEC</a>,&#8221; which ran in the </i>Honolulu Star-Advertiser<i> on July 17.</i></p>

<p><br />
It was an affront to see the photo of an elderly homeless man on your July 17, 2011 <i>Star-Advertiser</i> (SA) article, &#8220;Round-up of homeless feared during APEC.&#8221;</p>

<p>You need to show basic respect for this homeless man. Just because he is homeless does not entitle SA to treat him like a criminal. This man is not in an ideal situation, but he is still a human being. Every human being, prince or pauper, deserves basic respect. He has to be somebody&#8217;s son, or brother, father, uncle, or cousin. Who knows?</p>

<p>To add insult to your injury of this homeless man, you put his photo for sale for $26.95! Is SA sharing its profit with him? Did SA ask him for permission to market his plight? Whatever happened to basic decency? </p>

<p>Please review your policy. I hope this will never happen again.</p>

<p>Mahalo,</p>

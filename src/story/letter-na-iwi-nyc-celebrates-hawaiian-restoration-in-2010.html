<p>In the United States, regardless of our political views, most of us celebrate July 4th and it is observed as a national holiday. Similarly, we feel that regardless of our political views on Hawaiian sovereignty, we can still come together as one, to celebrate July 31st and have the day be observed once again as our own national holiday.</p>

<p>On July 31, 1843, after a six month illegal occupation of the Hawaiian Kingdom by British Naval Officer Paulet, King Kamehameha III, Kauikeaouli, was restored to the throne with the assistance of British Admiral Thomas. On this day Kauikeaouli proclaimed the phrase, &#8220;Ua mau ke ea o ka &#8216;?ina i ka pono&#8221; or &#8220;The sovereignty of the nation is perpetuated in righteousness.&#8221; Let us come together, to honor and celebrate, the true origins of Hawai&#8217;i's State motto.</p>

<p>Ka L? Ho‘iho‘i Ea, celebrated from 1843 to 1893, commemorates the British Crown&#8217;s acknowledgment of Hawai‘i as an independent nation. A testament to Hawai‘i and our right to self-governance. Originally, Ka L? Ho‘iho‘i Ea was a week long annual celebration marked by Hawaiian patriotism and all the best that our islands have to offer including music, crafts, games, food and community. It was celebrated for 50 years until, in 1893, Hawai‘i once again came under illegal occupation, this time by the United States of America.</p>

<p>Ka L? Ho&#8217;iho&#8217;i Ea was banned throughout the Hawaiian Kingdom in the year 1893 along with other Hawaiian national holidays such as La K?&#8216;oko&#8217;a or Hawaiian Independence Day. Ka L? Ho‘iho‘i Ea then experienced a rebirth in 1975 when Hawaiian national, scholar, and patriot Dr. Kekuni Blaisdell resurrected this holiday in honor and celebration of our continued independence and sovereignty, despite a century long American occupation. </p>

<p>We restore this happy day and invite all to come celebrate just as our kupuna did in Hawai&#8217;i 167 years ago. N? ?iwi NYC joins similar Ka L? Ho&#8217;iho&#8217;i Ea events being held in Boston, Rhode Island and Hawai&#8217;i, to celebrate and honor our ancestors, our history, our sovereignty and our unending fight for justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ua mau ke ea o ka &#8216;?ina i ka pono.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sovereignty of the nation is perpetuated in righteousness.&#8221;</p>

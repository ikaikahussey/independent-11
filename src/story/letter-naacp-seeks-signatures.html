<p>We are not backing down.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/tea-party-rejects-naacps-call-to-condemn-racist-signs-and-language/" title="Yesterday, the NAACP passed a resolution ">Yesterday, the NAACP passed a resolution </a>condemning the racist acts of Tea Party protesters. The backlash from the Tea Party has been furious.</p>

<p>But we are not an organization that shies away from controversy. The NAACP was founded on hope, not hate&#8212;and we will not stand idly by as racists work to divide our nation.</p>

<p>Add your name to our pledge to unify America and stop the racism:</p>

The NAACP does not have a problem with the Tea Party, nor its existence. We have a problem with their acceptance and their welcoming of prejudice into their organization.</p>

<p>And in case there is any misunderstanding about what defines racism, let me be clear.</p>

<p>In March, racial slurs were hurled at members of the Congressional Black Caucus as they passed by a Tea Party health care protest in Washington, DC. Missouri Representative Emanuel Cleaver was spat on. People at the rally held signs covered in bigotry.</p>

<p>That is racism. That is racism filled with hate, ignorance, and acts of violence. And we will not stand for it.</p>

<p>We are calling on all Americans to stand for the values that have made our country the land of the free and the home of the brave. <a href="http://action.naacp.org/PledgeToStopHate" title="Sign the pledge now">Sign the pledge now</a>.</p>

<p>The past year has been one of major triumphs and major setbacks in the fight for racial equality. But we will not let bigotry silence us.</p>

<p>We are one people. We are one nation. And we are all NAACP Americans.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support,</p>

<p><i>Ben Jealous<br />
President and CEO<br />

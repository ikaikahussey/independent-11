<p><br />
Aloha Mauna Kea Ohana,</p>

<p>For the last 15 years, we have made substantial progress in our efforts to protect Mauna Kea. Fighting to protect Mauna Kea continues to be an honor for which our gratitude is offered to Akua, Na Akua, and our Kupuna.</p>

<p>We have fought hard not only because of our love and respect for Mauna Kea but because the issues that culminate on our sacred summits (Mauna Kea and Haleakala) are the same as those we are facing across the entire archipelago&#8212;such as protecting Hawaiian rights and public access. A victory for Mauna Kea and Haleakala is a victory for our rights and access from the mountains to the sea.</p>

<p>Last January, our efforts for Mauna Kea were dealt a heavy blow when Judge Glenn Hara of the Third Circuit dismissed our case. Judge Hara&#8217;s decision combined with the political maneuvering of the University of Hawaii and State&#8217;s Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) impact the existing legal rights of Native Hawaiians, environmental groups, and the public at large to challenge developmental activities on public trust lands. This is serious and could impact the way conservation lands are governed across the archipelago for years to come.</p>

<p>The Mauna Kea Hui is committed to continue our fight for Mauna Kea and to overturn any unjust policies and we need your kokua.</p>

<p>These are tough times&#8212;felt by all. Please know we ask for your Aloha, prayers, and any kokua you may be able to offer. We thank you very much for your time and continued show of Aloha for Mauna Kea.</p>

<p>Aloha no,</p>

<p>Kealoha Pisciotta, President, Mauna Kea Anaina Hou</p>

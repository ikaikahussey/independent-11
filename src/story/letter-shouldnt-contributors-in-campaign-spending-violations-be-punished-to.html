<p>My compliments to Barbara Wong and the Campaign Spending Commission staff for their professional work in the <a href="http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20100415/NEWS01/4150319/Former-Honolulu-councilman-Felix-to-pay-50-000-fine" title="John Henry Felix campaign spending violation case">John Henry Felix campaign spending violation case</a>. With an important and contentious election season commencing, it is gratifying to know that they are &#8220;watching the store,&#8221; especially if there are any others out there who may be thinking of ways to circumvent campaign spending rules.</p>

<p>One aspect of the enforcement process does bother me, however. The candidate receiving the illegal contributions is sanctioned, but the contributors usually are not. Aren&#8217;t both sides part of the same equation?</p>

<p>I apologize, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that not sanctioning both contradicts the City&#8217;s current push to cite the &#8220;johns&#8221; along with the prostitutes.</p>

<p><i>The following letter was written by Honolulu City Councilmember Tom Berg, who represents Kapolei, Ewa, and the Waianae Coast.</i></p>

<p><br />
The Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill is <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/hawaiinews/20110720_City_pursues_extension_of_Waimanalo_landfills_life.html" target="_blank">destined to plague our district</a> for another decade or more unless we act to stop it. General comments are being accepted up to August 13. I sent a letter to the Department of Planning and Permitting requesting the comment period be extended.</p>

<p>I have introduced <a href="http://www4.honolulu.gov/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-110528/5x6pz-5m.pdf" target="_blank">Resolution 11-100</a> that combats the neglect, poor judgment, and lack of planning to remedy our landfill crisis. In my opinion, we need a specialist to focus on expediting new technologies to be permitted and get them up and running sooner than later to render the landfill obsolete. Instead, our City leaders are advancing resources to keep the landfill alive when my efforts counter that to rather expend resources to make landfill operations a way of the past. Nowadays, we can recycle more efficiently and lead the way in this industry.</p>

<p>Putting homeless families on agriculture land is worth the try and our office is leading the way for solutions. Let&#8217;s grow families instead of weeds. Our <a href="http://www.councilmanberg.com/pdfs/Reso11-54CD1proposed.pdf" target="_blank">Resolution 11-54 CD1 Proposed</a> is gaining ground. The <a href="http://www.councilmanberg.com/pdfs/shipping_container_flyer_2sht.pdf" target="_blank">shipping container concept</a> was recently covered by the <i><a href="http://www.midweek.com/content/zones/west_coverstory_article/shipping_containers_could_turn_into_homes/" target="_blank">MidWeek West Oahu Islander</a></i>.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Abercrombie,</p>

<p>I am 17 years of age and I go to Waianae high school. I&#8217;ve lived on the Westside for all of my life. I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way! I&#8217;m a very good but also concerned student, who worries a lot about what is going to happen to my family, the other homeless people who I have known for all of my life and I. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m proud to say that I&#8217;m graduating this year and also I&#8217;ll be going to the famous Butte College which is located in California after graduation. I&#8217;m attending Butte college with scholarships I&#8217;ve earned over time. Thanks be to God! </p>

<p>What I&#8217;m mostly concerned about is, what&#8217;s going to happen to my loving family, a family for college next? What&#8217;s going to come of them and many other homeless people? I don&#8217;t want to be attending my college and have to be worried about everyone while I am attending. So could you help us to overcome a very, very, important situation please? I know with God&#8217;s help, all of us who&#8217;ve been homeless for years, are going to overcome this obstacle! </p>

<p>Only you can be so kind to steer our way and change our date of eviction! Please help us to move on without such stress, or major worries! We really, really need to have time! All the families who I know are really stressing right now! It&#8217;s hard concentrate on moving and finding another place to live when time is quickly closing in on us. Once again, could you give my family and all the the other families an extension to move and find a decent place to live? Please kind sir, help us to try and overcome all the very difficult problems that we have to deal with.</p>

<p>God Bless and God Speed Mr. Abercrombie!</p>

<p>Faithfully yours,</p>

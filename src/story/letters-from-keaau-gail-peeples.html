To whom it may concern, </p>

<p>My name is Gail D. Peeples. I&#8217;m one of many who lives at Kea‘au Beach Park along with my husband, daughter, son, son-in-law, and five minor grandchildren. We&#8217;ve all lived at Kea‘au Beach for approximately 15 years. We&#8217;ve also learned to adjust to living here over all the years. </p>

<p>My husband and I lived in Ma‘ili for 16 years when our kids were little. But back then, we always had money, cars, a house, etc. My husband always had good jobs to help him provide for us, but our company folded and another good job he had went bankrupt. There was even another job he had for a long time when one of his supervisors took all of the monies from the government that was supposed to pay them for working. (He&#8217;s in hiding still). From then on, it seemed like everything was just going bad for us! There are so many other similar stories from a lot of other families and a lot of them are so heartbreaking for anyone to hear. </p>

<p>Over the years on the beach, a lot of things just accumulated and there is so, so much to do and so very little time. A lot of us don&#8217;t have any vehicles at all to help us to get moving. The beach is pretty much all everyone knows. It has been our only home we know for a long, long time. It would be so greatly appreciated if we could have more time! More time moving, more time to move our things out. I hope you would find it in your kind and loving heart to give us an extension to get our things together. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s not too much to ask for considering! All we need is a little more time! Please help all of us and all of the other many families who need an extension to move! Thank you so much for taking the time to consider reading all of our letters. I really hope we can help each other out. After all we are all God&#8217;s children! Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts. Please make it happen! </p>

<p>With all my love and hope, wishing for a miracle, sincerely yours,</p>

<p>Gayle D Peeples</p>

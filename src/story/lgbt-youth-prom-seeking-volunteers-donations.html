<p><i>The following is a message from Pride At Work Hawaii, which advocates for full equality for LGBITQ workers in their workplaces and their unions, and works to build mutual support between the labor movement and the LGBITQ community. Pride At Work Hawaii (an affiliate of the Hawaii State AFL-CIO) is a chapter of Pride At Work (www.prideatwork.org), a constituency group of the AFL-CIO:</i></p>

<p>Those of us who grew up in earlier times may envy the apparent openness and awareness of today&#8217;s youth; however, even though popular culture has begun presenting more positive images of LGBT people, the challenges faced by LGBT youth haven&#8217;t gone away. In fact, even as they come out younger, today&#8217;s youth face new challenges around issues of gender, sexuality, and acceptance on top of longstanding problems of harassment and discrimination. Because of this, and because we believe in encouraging the next generation(s) of leaders for our community, Pride At Work Hawaii has made supporting our LGBT youth one of our organizational priorities. </p>

<p>To that end, we strongly support the work of Q Element, an organization of and for LGBT youth. Q Element will once again be presenting its annual prom this month, and we encourage everyone who can to volunteer and/or donate to help this wonderful, important (and fun!) event. Information on the Prom, as provided by Q Element&#8217;s Caroline Leyva, is below.</p>

<b>LGBT Youth PROM 2010</b></p>

<p>LGBT Prom is expecting 100 to 120 youth and young adults, ages 24 and under, to attend. The prom offers Oahu&#8217;s LGBT youth and young adults a night of glamour and excitement to create a memorable event. In addition to the fun, LGBT Prom strives to provide a safe and substance free environment for our community&#8217;s LGBT youth and young adults.</p>

<p>LGBT Prom is looking for volunteers who are at least 25 years old, a member or ally of the LGBT community, a positive and mature role model for Oahu&#8217;s LGBT youth, and not romantically involved with any youth attending prom.</p>

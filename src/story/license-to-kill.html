<p>For myself, I can only say that with the recent killings, two in Hawaii, Mike Brown in Ferguson, and Eric Garner in New York, we can see an increasing escalation of police violence against everyday people. And as usual, people of color pay the highest price. There are no illusions, no veiled insinuations. </p>

<p>Agents like Deedy are clear that their training and their intention is to kill. No warning shots. No dialogue necessary. If an officer or agent feels threatened in any way, they are trained that it is their right to take you down with lethal force. And as the Not Guilty verdict on murder shows, they can do it with impunity.</p>

<p>So hold close to your loved ones and cherish the time you have with them. Because in this Brave New World, any tiny mistake you make - jaywalking, wearing a hoodie, selling cigarettes - gives them license to kill.</p>

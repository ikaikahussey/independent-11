<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day this Sunday, an occasion that despite my status as a mom I often regard strictly as a Hallmark holiday. Still, I enjoy getting a treat on that day, whether it be something my daughter made or a few extra hours in bed with a good book. I also like jewelry, preferably something unusual and hip.&nbsp; So it is worth hinting that Lily Lotus Boutique in Kaimuki is hosting a Satya Jewelry Trunk Show this weekend. Friday May 7 kicks off the event with cocktails from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Send mom with a few friends to peruse these beautiful and inspirational adornments, though watch out&#8212;the temptation might be overwhelming. Hailing from New York City, Satya Jewelry is a favorite with celebs ranging from Scarlett Johansen to Susan Sarandon and blends a global, yoga vibe with a fashion forward sensibility. Despite the chic factor, they maintain a reasonable price point and will be 15% off throughout the weekend. Liliy Lotus Boutique is located at 1127 12th Avenue. </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Governor Linda Lingle has released $65.5 million to the Department of Education (DOE) for repair and maintenance projects to public school campuses and DOE facilities statewide.</p>

<p>The funds will be used as part of an effort to implement an estimated $140.5 million worth of repairs and improvements at close to 250 public schools across the state: $46 million on Oahu, $8.9 million on Hawaii Island, $7.5 million on Maui, and $3.1 million on Kauai.</p>

<p>The planned projects include electrical repairs, reroofing, resurfacing of driveways, drainage improvements, computer lab repairs, replacing doors and windows, fire alarm upgrades, air conditioning improvements, ventilation and ceiling fan upgrades, handicap ramps, restroom renovations, new fences, new cafeteria equipment, installing safety railings, plumbing repairs, parking lot improvements, and various structural improvements.</p>

<p>&#8220;The State’s focus on repair and maintenance of public schools and our ongoing capital improvement project plan to modernize public facilities statewide is helping to stimulate the economy and create jobs for our residents,” Lingle said.</p>

<p>The three names submitted by the Democratic Party to fill the vacant Senate District 22 (Mililani Mauka, Wahiawa, Haleiwa, Mokuleia, North Shore) seat are: Laura Figueira, John Kampfer, and Lei Learmont.</p>

<p>The three names submitted by the Democratic Party to fill the vacant Senate District 7 (Kauai and Niihau) seat are: Ronald Kouchi, Barbara Robeson, and Sandra Wright.</p>

<p>Lingle is seeking public comments on the six candidates. Public comments may be sent via e-mail to joy.watari@hawaii.gov or by fax at (808) 586-0006. All comments should be submitted by the close of business on August 25.</p>

<p>The individuals appointed by the Governor will serve on a temporary basis until State Senators for the two vacant seats are elected in November&#8217;s General Election.</p>

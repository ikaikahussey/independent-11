<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Although Honolulu ranks 49th among U.S. cities in population, the island of Oahu, and its population of about 905,000 people, ranks as the 12th largest municipality (according to the U.S. Census Bureau, anyway). One of the hallmarks of a major metropolis is a thriving live music culture, and in that respect the City and County of Honolulu, which all of Oahu comprises, meets that standard. There are a whole lot of places to find live music night and day, every day. For the purpose of the following list of vital performance venues, we’ll consider all of Oahu “Honolulu,” as residents can be home within an hour after taking in a show anywhere on the island. </p>

<p>Pipeline Café is Honolulu’s de facto concert hall venue for touring national acts. Also featuring standup and improv comedy, Pipeline hosts all manner of popular music, from hip hop to hardcore: the major acts that don’t quite rate a booking at Neil Blaisdell Center. The NBC is Honolulu’s major concert venue. Some of the most legendary names in entertainment in the world have performed in the arena or at the concert hall. The only bigger venue in Honolulu is Aloha Stadium. Exclusively the province of icons like Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, and U2, a concert at the stadium is worth attending no matter who is performing, as it will always be a very big deal. The Waikiki Shell is Honolulu’s premiere festival venue, ideal by virtue of its relaxed outdoor setting and the fact that you can enjoy concerts from the park just beyond the fence for free.</p>

<p>But the availability of live music at a variety of non-concert venues is among the things that make a city special. Honolulu is no exception. Too numerous to list entirely, the number of live music venues here is indicative of a flourishing musical culture. The following, in no particular order, are some of the most familiar places that can be relied upon for good, live entertainment.</p>

<p>In Honolulu-proper, or “town,” music lovers can find a fix every night of the week. Anna Bannana’s, in its 40 years of existence, has always been legendary for its shows featuring underground rock, funk, and reggae by favorite local and national bands. Waikiki is home to places like Jimmy Buffett’s and Kelly O’Neil’s, both among many establishments that host live music every night. Just outside Waikiki, Jazz Minds is home to Honolulu’s hep.</p>

<p>Downtown is home to a handful of live music venues, O’Toole’s Irish Pub being among those to have live music every night with no cover charge. Next Door hosts local and national indie acts in a red brick, concert hall setting. The Dragon Upstairs features studied jazz professionals in an intimate, low-light setting.</p>

<p>Outside of town, there are places like Kemoo Pub in Wahiawa and Kainoa’s in Haleiwa that feature quality rock and reggae and don’t require a trip to town for the country folk. Over in Kailua, Boardriders and Big City Diner feature local acts ranging from reggae to bluegrass.</p>

<p>Clearly, there is no dearth of live music in Honolulu. Many here are keen on seeing bands regularly, whatever their musical preferences may be, and venue owners in the industry are keenly aware of that fact. A quick check of calendar listings will provide music lovers all they need to find what they’re listening for in Honolulu.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Political Action Committee and Executive Board of UNITE HERE! Local 5&#8212;a local labor organization representing over 10,500 hotel, health care, and food service workers throughout Hawaii has voted to endorse former State Senator Gary Hooser in his bid to become Hawaii’s next Lieutenant Governor.</p>

<p>Citing his record in support of Hawaii’s working families, Joli Tokusato, a worker at the Ilikai Hotel for the last 20 years and chair of Local 5’s Political Action Committee said: “There’s one candidate in this race with experience we can count on, and that’s Gary Hooser. Senator Hooser is the only neighbor island candidate and the only one with leadership experience on the both the County and State levels. He knows our issues and listens to our concerns because he understands the value of hard work.”</p>

<p>Rod Kane, a cook at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani hotel added, “I’m proud of our Union’s endorsement of Gary Hooser because he’s consistently stood with us on the front lines of fighting for good jobs for this community. He was there for us at Turtle Bay, in our campaign at the Royal Kona Resort on the Big Island, and our statewide hotel and Kaiser campaigns as well.”</p>

<p>Tokusato said Hawaii&#8217;s workers and communities are being hurt by big business.</p>

<p>“Working families in every community around our State are feeling the squeeze, yet more and more money is being sucked out of our State while wealthy corporations continue to use the economy as an excuse to hurt workers, Tokusato said. &#8220;In this economy and in this election, we need a real leader who will work with us to defend our community and stand up for the little guy, not another typical politician; we need real experience, and not just talk or a catchy campaign slogan.&#8221;</p>

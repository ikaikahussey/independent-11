<p>Hawaii hospitality and healthcare union Local 5 has filed eight unfair labor practice charges against Aston Waikiki Beach and Hotel Renew, alleging violations of federal labor law against non-union workers at the two hotels.<br />
 <br />
The charges allege that the two hotels, both managed by Aston Hotels &amp; Resorts, violated federal law through the unlawful organization of an aggressive anti-union campaign that included threats, interrogation and surveillance. <br />
 <br />
In February, workers began organizing for a fair process for union representation. The Aston Waikiki Beach and Hotel Renew employ 160 and 25 workers, respectively. Workers from various departments have voiced concerns about the lack of respect from management.<br />
 <br />
“One of my supervisors told me, ‘You’re already old and supposed to retire. Don’t sign [in support of a fair process].’ And after I joined a rally in support of the union, another supervisor told me she could write me up for going,” says Elpidio Sera, an employee in the housekeeping department at Aston Waikiki Beach, “This makes me not want to come into work because they’re bullying and intimidating me.”<br />
 <br />
“After an unfair labor practice charge was filed against our housekeeping supervisor, she said to us during one of our morning briefings, ‘You guys wrote me up. Now I’m going to write you guys up.’ Then she specifically called out two coworkers and me. She was speaking much louder than usual. I felt threatened, but I stood my ground,” says Tino Fabro, who also works in the Aston Waikiki Beach housekeeping department.<br />
 <br />
Miami-based Interval Leisure Group, which owns Aston Hotel &amp; Resorts, reported that Aston’s Hawaii resorts have increased their revenue per available room, or RevPAR, by 4.2% year over year.</p>

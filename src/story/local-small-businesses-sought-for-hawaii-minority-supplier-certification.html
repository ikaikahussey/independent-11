<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Hawaii&#8217;s small businesses are invited to attend several information sessions on how to beef up the tools necessary to make it in today&#8217;s economy.</p>

<p>Hawaii Minority Supplier Certification (HMSC) is holding free talks and a pau hana session this week to go over the benefits of being a certified minority supplier, maximizing services, and how to navigate Corporate America.</p>

<p>A Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) is a business that is at least 51 percent owned, operated, and controlled on a daily basis by American citizens who identify as an ethnic minority (Hawaiian, Asian Pacific, Hispanic, African American, Asian Indian, and Native American). In general, the purpose of the MBE designation is to partner with larger firms to gain access to the resources that most MBE&#8217;s do not have access to.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the goal of HMSC to provide minority businesses with nationally-recognized certification to connect corporate members with certified Hawaii minority suppliers.</p>

<p>HMSC says certification provides exposure to business opportunities, national and local referrals, direct access to procurement executives and buyers, invitations to private networking events and seminars, and access to business development resources.</p>

<p>HMSC is a regional chapter of the Northern California Minority Supplier Development Council (NCMSDC), a 501(c)3 non-profit national organization comprised of 38 regional councils with a combined consitutency of over 15,000 certified Minority Business Enterprise suppliers, and 3,500 corporate members.</p>

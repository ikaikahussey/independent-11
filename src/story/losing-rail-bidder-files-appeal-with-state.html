<p>One of the companies that did not win the core systems contract for Honolulu&#8217;s rail transit system filed an appeal Wednesday with the State, claiming that the City wrongly disqualified its proposal. <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/15001902/losing-rail-bidder-files-appeal-with-state" target="_blank">Hawaii News Now&#8217;s Ben Gutierrez reports</a>.</p>

<p>On Thursday, June 30 at 1:00 p.m., Sumitomo Corporation Vice President Gino Antoniello will announce the company’s plans moving forward in regards to the City’s denial of their protest at Goodsill Law Offices at 1099 Alakea Street, Suite 1800.</p>

<p>MANOA &#8212; The Lyon Arboretum will honor Endangered Species Day with two days of family activities at the 200-acre botanical garden, home to ever 5000 plant species in Manoa&#8217;s lush interior. The activities are designed to raise awareness about Hawaii&#8217;s endangered plant species and to highlight the critical need for conservation and habitat protection.</p>

<p>Scheduled activities include a native Hawaiian species photo contest, a film festival, a keiki scavenger hunt, and a plant sale. Tours will be offered with tips on planting and propogation.</p>

<p>The Manoa Arboretum was founded by the Hawaii Sugar Planters Association in 1918. The original Director, Harold Lyon, planted over 2000 plant species on the property. The site was conveyed to the University of Hawaii in 1953, and renamed in honor of Lyon after his death in 1957.</p>

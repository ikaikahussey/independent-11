<p>Former Honolulu Symphony pops conductor Maestro Matt Catingub this week announced the formation of Hawaii Pops, Hawaii’s first independent pops orchestra.&nbsp; A non-profit organization, Hawaii Pops will launch its first season in September 2013, offering a series of concerts featuring popular artists, music and entertainment at the Hawaii Convention Center. The premiere season will run through May 2014.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hawaii Pops will offer music lovers three distinct experiences: full orchestra performances, jazz orchestra or big band performances, and small ensemble performances. Full orchestra performances will feature an orchestra of 40 musicians and offer guests an evening of music, dinner and dancing in the Hawaii Convention Center’s Ballroom.&nbsp; Jazz orchestra or big band performances will feature an ensemble of approximately 12 musicians who will back up special guest artists from the jazz or contemporary music fields. Small ensembles of three to six musicians will also be available to perform in small venues and at private functions.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hawaii Pops season will run from September to May with the first concert scheduled for September 14, 2013.</p>

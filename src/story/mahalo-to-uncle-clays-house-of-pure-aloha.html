<p>My thanks to <a href="http://www.houseofpurealoha.com">Uncle Clay&#8217;s House of Pure Aloha</a> for sponsoring the Independent this week, and for helping us to launch our new weekly newsletter. Uncle Clay has the best shave ice toppings on the island, including Kalespin, which is a great way to get your kids to eat their vegetables. Kudos to them for making a quality local product, and mahalo for making local journalism possible.</p>

<p>Stop by this weekend after voting to get one free topping, and tell them you read about them here.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Storm Water Quality Branch of the Department of Environmental Services (ENV) is holding both the Kaneohe and Waimanalo &#8220;Make-A-Difference Day&#8221; events this Saturday, October 9.</p>

<p>Volunteers must check-in by 8:00 a.m. at the Castle High Auditorium parking lot or Kahawai Stream on Kalanianaole Highway. King Intermediate School students and residents of Waikapoki and Waikalua check-in at Ben Parker Elementary School. Cleanups start at 8:30 a.m. and take two hours.</p>

<p>The City will educate participants on healthy yard and clean stream practices as part of its Adopt-A-Stream projects at Kawa and Kahawai streams. Volunteers will clear weedy overgrowth, amend soil, plant shrubs, and ground cover to stabilize the soil, mulch, and gather green waste for disposal. Free mulch will be available to residents at Mekia and Kakaina streets while supplies last.</p>

<p>Participants should dress to get dirty and bring water, a hat, old shoes, and sunscreen. All participants must sign a release form to participate in the cleanups.</p>

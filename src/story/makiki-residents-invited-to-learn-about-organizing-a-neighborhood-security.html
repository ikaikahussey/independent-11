<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On Monday, January 24, the Honolulu Police Department and Makiki legislators are holding a meeting to get residents caught up on how to set up a Neighborhood Security Watch (NSW) program. </p>

<p>The meeting, held at Christ United Methodist Church from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., will look into what it takes to start a NSW, how the community benefits, and what resources are available to volunteer groups. Essentially, a NSW empowers residents to partner with police and with each other to increase the safety and security of their homes and communities, and more importantly to build community unity and pride.</p>

<p>A potluck gathering immediately follows the presentation and meeting. </p>

<p>The international leg of Malama Honua was supposed to begin tomorrow with Hokule&#8217;a and its sister ship Hikianalia departing from Hilo for Tahiti. The Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS) canoes must wait for a suitable weather window in order to depart safely for the first destination on the worldwide voyage.<br />
 <br />
In consultation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), PVS president Nainoa Thompson has determined that conditions will not be ideal for departure on Saturday, May 24. Weather permitting, the crews are now planning to depart from Hilo on Tuesday, May 27.<br />
 <br />
The Voyaging Society released a statement saying, &#8220;PVS will continue to prioritize the safety of its voyaging canoes and crew members by waiting for the appropriate weather conditions for departure.&#8221; </p>

<p>There are no public ceremonies or media events planned by PVS for the day of departure.</p>

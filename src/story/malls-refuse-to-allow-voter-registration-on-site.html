<p><a href="http://www.nationalvoterregistrationday.org/">National Voter Registration Day</a> is right around the corner (Sept. 24), and the <a href="http://www.lwv-hawaii.com/">League of Women Voters Hawaii</a> is doing it&#8217;s best to get Honolulu residents registered. Voting is a part of our civic duty. It&#8217;s the backbone of democracy. And while we <em>are</em> voting for politicians, the act of registering to vote itself is not political.</p>

<p>Ala Moana Shopping Center and Pearlridge Shopping Center seem to be confused about that. Both malls denied the League&#8217;s request to register voters on their premises. Both would have made excellent target sites in the League&#8217;s efforts to get young people registered especially. It would be one thing if the League was promoting a particular candidate or party, but they aren&#8217;t. They&#8217;re performing they&#8217;re own civic duty by helping under-represented groups (like young people) grow their voice and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>One shopping center that has it figured out the right way is Mililani Town Center. The League will have representatives there on the 24 from noon to 6 p.m.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A man accused of threatening to behead freshman Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, was arrested Wednesday by Mexican and California police in Tijuana, say the FBI and Capitol Police.</p>

<p>Aniruddha Sherbow was set to make his initial appearance in federal court Thursday in San Diego, where more details of his alleged crime are expected to be unveiled. According to media outlets in Hawaii, Sherbow sent an e-mail to the FBI threatening to decapitate Gabbard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresoever she may be, and to sever her head from her body,&#8221; he reportedly wrote.</p>

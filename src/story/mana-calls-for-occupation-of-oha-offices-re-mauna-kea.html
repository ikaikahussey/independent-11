<p>MANA, Movement for Aloha No ka ʻᾹina, is calling upon the lahui kanaka (Hawaiian community) and supporters to join us in occupying the Office of Hawaiian Affairs for an extended vigil from Wednesday April 22, 3 p.m. until positive results for the protection of Mauna Kea are achieved. Concerned community members are being asked to bring their sleeping bags, toothbrushes, flags and banners and occupy the office until the Board of Trustees meeting on Thursday at 12:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Two primary demands will be made of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs:</p>

<p>That OHA Board of Trustees must agendize the Mauna Kea TMT issue</p>

<p>That OHA must join the lahui kanaka and utilize its vast resources and position to protect Mauna Kea and support the efforts of beneficiaries who are occupying the mountain</p>

<p>“OHA’s own strategic plan provides every reason and justification that they need to support and stand in solidarity with their beneficiaries to oppose the building of the TMT and to do their part to bring an end to any further desecration of the most sacred place in all of Hawaiʻi,” said MANA spokesperson Andre Perez. “Despite weeks of testimony and calls to the board over Mauna Kea, it’s entirely absent from this week’s agenda. OHA cannot continue to sit and ignore the most important and volatile Hawaiian issue of the decade. It is their responsibility to support their beneficiaries.”</p>

<p>Ku Kiaʻi Mauna organizers Lanakila Manguail and Kahoʻokahi Kanuha will be present at the occupation and will provide an update on the situation on the mountain. Other activities will include workshops, mele lahui (national songs) by Palani Vaughn and Jon Osorio, and Aloha ʻᾹina speeches by Kaleikoa Kaʻeo and others.</p>

“Mana Foods is pleased to team up with the community to help those devastated in Japan.&nbsp; It is always a worthwhile cause to help neighbors in need,” said Thielk.</p>

<p>Donations raised will go to support the Japanese Cultural Society of Maui&#8217;s Japan relief effort &#8220;The Aloha Initiative,&#8221; to provide citizens of Japan who have been displaced by the recent earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis with a warm and welcome home, &#8220;Wear Jeans for Japan&#8221; is being co-sponsored by the County of Maui and Carden Academy of Maui. During this event, people will pay for the privilege to dress casually by wearing jeans on May 13.&nbsp; Some county departments and local businesses have already taken up the challenge.</p>

<p><em>“Enhance, protect, conserve and manage Hawaii’s unique and limited natural, cultural and historic resources held in public trust for current and future generations of the people of Hawaii nei, and its visitors, in partnership with others from the public and private sectors.” — Department of Land and Natural Resources Mission Statement</em></p>

<p><a href="http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/">The Department of Land and Natural Resources</a> (DLNR) is responsible for “managing, administering, and exercising control over public lands, water resources, ocean waters, navigable streams, coastal areas (except commercial harbors), minerals, and all interests therein.” </p>

<p>DLNR is headed by an executive Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) which sets policy for the Department to execute. The director of DLNR also serves as the chair of BLNR, the chair of the Commission on Water Resource Management, and as the state&#8217;s Historic Preservation Officer.</p>

<p><strong>The Board and the Commission</strong></p>

<p>BLNR is composed of seven members: one from each of the four land districts (county), two at large, and the chairperson (the executive head of the department). Members are nominated and, with the consent of the Senate, appointed by the Governor for a four-year term. No more than three members of the board may be from the same political party. Any member having any interest—direct or indirect—in any matter before the board must disqualify him/herself from voting on or participating in the discussion of the matter. </p>

<p>BLNR convenes twice monthly to review and take action on department submittals, including land leases and Conservation District Use Applications (CDUAs). Testimony from the public on program actions, development plans, permit applications and all other BLNR actions are accepted and heard at this time. The BLNR is governed by Hawaii Revised Statutes, Chapter 171-4.</p>

<p>The Commission on Water Resource Management administers the State Water Code, which was created by the 1987 Hawaii State Legislature. The commission’s general mission is to protect and enhance the water resources of the State of Hawaii through wise and responsible management.</p>

<p>There are a total of seven members on the commission. The chairperson of the BLNR (director of DLNR) also serves as chairperson of the Water Commission, and the other ex-officio member is always the Director of the State Department of Health. The other five members are appointed by the Governor from lists submitted by a nominating committee, subject to confirmation by the Senate. </p>

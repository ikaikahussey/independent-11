<p>Based in Kailua, Manoa Chocolate is setting a powerful example for our local economy: they&#8217;re producing their chocolate right here in the islands. </p>

<p>Spearheaded by Dylan Butterbaugh, the small company is raising money to expand their operations, so that they can bring their excellent product into retail stores. They set a goal of $15,000 on Kickstarter, and as of this writing, they&#8217;re at $17,831. Check out their project <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1948542746/manoa-hawaiian-chocolate-bean-to-bar-handcrafted-f">here</a>.</p>

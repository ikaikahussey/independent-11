<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Starting March 11, the Honolulu Academy of Arts will extend its museum hours on the second Thursday of every month. On that day the museum will be open from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The evening is called aloHAA, and is part of an effort to make the museum more accessible to people who may want to explore the galleries and special exhibitions, but can&#8217;t make it during regular museum hours. At 5:00 p.m., the Pavilion Cafe will open as a counter-service lounge selling small-plate, easy-to-eat dishes such as steak Florentine sandwiches. A bar will serve beer, wine and a specialty cocktail. The evening will also feature music&#8212;live and recorded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Art can be a transforming and uplifting experience,&#8221; says Academy Director Stephen Little. &#8220;Combine a couple hours in the galleries with a cocktail and some appetizers by chef Mike Nevin in the cafe, and you have a perfect way to unwind after work.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the inaugural aloHAA, Little will give two short talks about the Academy&#8217;s big spring exhibition, From Whistler to Warhol: Modernism on Paper, which is on view through July 3. The talks will be held in Gallery 27 at 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Regular museum admission&#8212;$10 for adults, $5 for seniors, military and students&#8212;applies during aloHAA. Members get in free.</p>

<p>Visitors can make a full evening of aloHAA&#8212;see what&#8217;s new in the galleries, have something to eat and drink, then see a film at the Doris Duke Theatre. There is separate admission for the theater.</p>

<p>After 4:30 p.m. visitors can park for free in the staff parking lot at 1035 Kinau Street, just Diamond Head of the Admiral Thomas condominium. Regular guest parking is the parking lot behind the Academy Art Center at Linekona, at Victoria Street between Beretania and Young streets&#8212;just $3 for four hours (available at the Front Desk) 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., then $4 flat rate from 4:00 p.m. on.</p>

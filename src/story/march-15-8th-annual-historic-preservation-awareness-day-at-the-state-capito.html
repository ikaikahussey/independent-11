<p>The 8th Annual Historic Preservation Awareness Day is scheduled for Monday, March 15 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on the third floor of the Hawai&#8217;i State Capitol. The event is co-sponsored by the Historic Hawai&#8217;i Foundation and the State Legislature&#8217;s Heritage Caucus 2010.</p>

<p>More than 40 historic preservation organizations and leaders from across the state will feature distinctive and informative exhibits to help raise awareness about preserving and perpetuating Hawai&#8217;i's heritage.</p>

<p>Participants include Mission Houses Museum, Pacific Aviation Museum,&nbsp; Laupahoehoe Train Museum, Bishop Museum, Arts District Merchants Association, Friends of &#8216;Iolani Palace, Chaminade University&#8212;Interior Design, Kailua Historical Society, Malama o Manoa, Hawai&#8217;i Junior Archaeology Outreach Program, Commander Navy Region Hawai&#8217;i, the University of Hawai&#8217;i at Manoa&#8217;s College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources&#8212;fashion collection, and more.</p>

<p>This partnership between the Historic Hawai&#8217;i Foundation and the Heritage Caucus is an example of public, private and non-profit sectors working together to protect and preserve Hawai&#8217;i's cultural places.</p>

<p>The Historic Hawai&#8217;i Foundation and the lawmakers of the Heritage Caucus are committed to the preservation and promotion of our historic buildings and sites to ensure that later generations will have the opportunity to enjoy the unique treasures of Hawai&#8217;i's history and heritage. Some of these treasures include Honolulu Hale, Tantalus Drive, Fort Kamehameha and Haleiwa Residences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Historic Preservation Awareness Day is part of the collaborative effort to demonstrate the range of business, education, advocacy and arts organizations engaged in preserving Hawaii&#8217;s historic and cultural resources,&#8221; said Kiersten Faulkner, Historic Hawai&#8217;i Foundation Executive Director.</p>

<p>The public is encouraged to attend this free event to show support for Hawai&#8217;i's heritage and share their ideas while learning about the various efforts going on or being planned to protect our historic places. Some organizations will offer membership signup.</p>

<p>Historic Hawai&#8217;i Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1974 by citizens concerned about the need to protect Hawai&#8217;i's legacy and essential character. It has since become the driving force behind preservation efforts in the state, encouraging the safeguarding of historic buildings, areas and communities tied to Hawai&#8217;i's history. Historic Hawai&#8217;i Foundation strives to ensure that the heritage remains a living and useful part of the present within the communities.</p>

<p>The Heritage Caucus, created in 2006, is comprised of 36 representatives and seven senators. Its mission is to collaborate with the community to identify and preserve the state&#8217;s historic resources and to cultivate appreciation for Hawai&#8217;i's unique heritage. This year, the Caucus focuses on advocacy by engaging individuals and organizations interested in the preservation of Hawai&#8217;i's historical resources.</p>

<p>The Honolulu Board of Water Supply (BWS), in partnership with the Pearl City Urban Garden Center&#8217;s Oahu Master Gardeners Cooperative Extension Services and the Friends of Halawa Xeriscape Garden, invite the community to &#8220;A Morning with the Plant Doctor&#8221; at the Halawa Xeriscape Garden.</p>

<p>Whether you have a &#8220;green&#8221; or &#8220;black thumb,&#8221; visitors will greatly benefit from the expertise and knowledge of these certified Master Gardeners as they address general plant concerns&#8212;discovering what&#8217;s bugging your plants while learning how to conserve water outdoors. The BWS and its partners hope that this informational morning educates the community about alternative ways to conserve water outdoors.</p>

<p>Those wishing to visit with the plant doctor are encouraged to bring several samples from each plant and store them in separate bags. Also, please do not bring dead or dried leaves.

<p>The public is invited to the Hamakua Community Resource Fair on Sunday, March 21 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Honokaa County Gym on Hawaii Island.</p>

<p>The Hamakua Resource Fair is a collaborative effort by county, state, and federal officials and will bring together government, financial, educational, health care, and community groups in an effort to share information with the residents of Hamakua about the programs and services that are available to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This fair is a collaborative effort among different groups in our community to introduce and bring available resources to Hamakua,&#8221; Rep. Mark Nakashima said.</p>

<p>The program will also include a celebration of athletes and scholars from Honokaa for their respective achievements over the last year. Participants will also be provided with an update of projects throughout the Hamakua District.</p>

<p>&#8220;In these challenging economic times, it is important for us to work together as one&#8212;county, state and federal&#8212;to support each other,&#8221; said Mayor Billy Kenoi.</p>

<p>The fair is free and open to the public and lunch will be served.</p>

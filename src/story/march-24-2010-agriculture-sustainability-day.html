<p>Experience all that local agriculture has to offer at the 2010 Agriculture Sustainability Day on Wednesday, March 24 at the Hawaii State Capitol. Now in its fourth year, the event showcases Hawaii&#8217;s diverse agricultural industry and the many partnerships that make up this thriving industry. Exhibitors will be situated on the fourth floor walkway of the Hawaii State Capitol from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Ag Sustainability Day is an opportunity for policy makers and the public to learn about Hawaii&#8217;s agriculture industry and meet many of the organizations and people who supply our communities with locally grown and produced products. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity to get to know the farmers and organizations that are crucial to the sustainability of our industry,&#8221; says Mae Nakahata, Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation President.</p>

<p>The Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation (HFBF) along with the Hawaii Food Industry Association (HFIA), Hawaii Food Manufacturers Association (HFMA), Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA), the University of Hawaii at Manoa College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (UH-CTAHR), and Aloha Air Cargo are this year&#8217;s sponsors.</p>

<p>In helping to promote local agriculture and a healthy lifestyle, there will also be a Farmers Market co-sponsored by Representative Clift Tsuji, Senator Russell Kokubun, Senator Jill Tokuda, and Senator Dwight Takamine. All produce and products at the Ag Sustainability Day Farmers Market will be locally grown and/or produced. Proceeds from the Farmers Market will be donated to the Hawaii Food Bank.</p>

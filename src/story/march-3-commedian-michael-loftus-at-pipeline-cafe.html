<p>Michael Loftus&#8217; career as a comic and actor started in Columbus, Ohio, where he founded the comedy troupe called Midwest Comedy Tool &amp; Die. After sharpening his craft, he decided to head out west to pursue stand-up. Once in Los Angeles, he began writing and performing for the Acme Comedy Theater and soon after, his career took off. He is currently a writer on the hit ABC comedy series The George Lopez Show. He has appeared on Comedy Central&#8217;s Premium Blend and on Star Search. In addition to his own comedy album, he has appeared on the Warner Bros. comedy album, Executive Privilege, alongside Kevin Pollack and The Best Of Bob &amp; Tom CD. He is a regular performer at Improv clubs across the country delivering his high energy, off-the-cuff comedy to sell-out crowds. Watch as one man battles his political cynicism with the world today while simultaneously juggling the red-state/blue state politics within his own extended family.</p>

<p>Michael Loftus&#8217; wholesome looks might fool viewers, but this seemingly mild-mannered Midwesterner has a sharper tongue than some may realize. Whether he&#8217;s pointing out the pros and cons of sleeping naked or likening a wedding ring to a mystical relic out of &#8220;Lord of the Rings,&#8221; Loftus uses energetic physical comedy to cynically skewer life in suburbia and beyond.</p>

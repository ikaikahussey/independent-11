<p>The Department of Environmental Services&#8212;Storm Water Quality Branch is conducting the Isenberg Adopt-A-Block cleanup Saturday, March 6.</p>

<p>Volunteers are needed from 8:00 a.m. to 10 a.m. to cut grass, clean streets, and gutters, pick up litter, remove graffiti, and stencil storm drains.</p>

<p>ENV&#8212;partnering with the Pride in Moiliili volunteers, numerous businesses, schools, public officials, the state, and military&#8212;will provide supplies. Volunteers need to sign a release form when checking in at Moiliili Field.&nbsp; Volunteers should bring water, wear a hat, old shoes, sunscreen, and dress to get dirty.</p>

<p>The event creates awareness of non-point source pollution and water quality issues, provides information on protecting our waters to specific audiences, encourages partnerships between citizens and local government, and motivates positive behavioral change to keep streams healthy.</p>

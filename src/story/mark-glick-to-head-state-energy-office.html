<p>HONOLULU&#8212;It was announced Monday that Mark Glick will step into role of Energy Administrator for the Strategic Industries. Glick will oversee the <a href="http://energy.hawaii.gov/" target="_blank">State Energy Office</a>, which is part of the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT). </p>

<p>The Energy Office’s role is to provide a catalyst through investment, policy, and regulatory frameworks that enables the development of clean energy businesses, projects and the growth of new jobs for Hawaii. The office is guided by the State&#8217;s proposed, and loosely defined, goal of reaching 70 percent clean energy by 2030.</p>

<p>Glick headed operations and economic development for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs from 2003 to 2010.&nbsp; As Director of Economic Development, he was the architect of changes to the agency’s 17-year old low-interest financing program and led efforts to establish the Hawaii Procurement Technical Assistance Center.</p>

<p>Glick joined DBEDT in July of 2010. There, at the State Energy Office, Glick has managed the $9.5 million Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant and was tasked to the Hawaii Economic Development Task Force created by The Food and Energy Security Act 73(10) serving as the principal author of the Task Force’s Report to the 2011 Hawaii Legislature.</p>

<p>The appointment fills the position formerly held by Ted Peck, who resigned in December. Estrella Seese filled the role as Interim Administrator since January.</p>

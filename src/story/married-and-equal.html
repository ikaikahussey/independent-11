<p><em>Above: Monica Montgomery (left) and Donna Gedge (right) smile after completing their marriage application, 45 minutes after midnight on Monday. The pair have been a couple for 35 years.</em></p>

<p>After decades of sound and fury, the first same-sex marriages early Monday morning happened in almost complete silence and intimacy. Standing in huddles on a stage in a Waikiki lounge, the couples  read their vows and their officiants performed an act which had only minutes-before become legal. </p>

<p>And in a few short minutes, the hushed sanctity of an intimate conversation transitioned to applause and standing ovations for the pioneers of marriage equality.</p>

<p>Among the group of newlyweds this morning is a person who was part of the team that prepared for the <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/dont-forget-the-baehr-case">Baehr</a> lawsuit, more than two decades ago. Monday&#8217;s weddings would not have been possible without efforts like Baehr, and the many people who pushed for civil unions,&nbsp; reached out to non-LGBT organizations such as labor unions, or who simply maintained hope in the face of intolerance and hate. </p>

<p>The arc of the moral universe is indeed long, and it&#8217;s through consistent pressure from the hopeful that it bends towards justice.</p>

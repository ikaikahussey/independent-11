<p>WAILUKU&#8212;The Maui Fire Department has contained a brushfire which burned an estimated 10 acres in Olowalu overnight.</p>

<p>The fire was first reported around 8:30 p.m. above a pig farm in the area. Although flames did not damage any homes, three families living in nearby homes were evacuated as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p>The weather was a mixed blessing for fire fighters. While wind last night helped spread the fire rain early this morning helped them contain the blaze. As of about 8:15 a.m. fire fighters had the fire 100 percent contained however crews remain on scene to mop up and monitor the situation.</p>

<p>WAILUKU, Maui&#8212;Heavy rains have snarled Lahaina traffic and Upcountry power but otherwise Maui County work crews have reported no major weather incidents this morning.</p>

<p>Police said wind and rain were responsible for a downed traffic signal at Kaanapali Parkway. Two other traffic lights&#8212;one near Kapoli Street and another near Hilo Hatties&#8212;are also affected.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Maui police officers are on scene directing traffic until the traffic signals can be repaired.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In Maalaea the heavy rains threatened to overflow a culvert near Haoli Road and public works crews were considering closing the road. However the rains have since eased and crews are allowing the road to remain open while they monitor the situation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Also Department of Water Supply repair crews continue to work on a damaged 8-inch water main in the Kula area. Area residents were notified yesterday to boil their water before using it or to use water from two of the countyâ€™s water tankers stationed in the area.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Water Department officials will notify the public when the water is safe to drink after the line is repaired and the water tested for contamination. </p>

<p>Maui Electric Company officials said about 1,400 customers in the Ulapalakua and Keokea area lost power at 9:20 a.m. when the weather snapped a power line along Kula Highway. Power was restored to all customers at around 10:45 a.m. </p>

<p>Another much smaller power outage affecting about 20 customers living along Polipoli Road is still ongoing. </p>

<p>The Parks Department also announced that rains have forced the closure of the Waiehu Golf Course and Keokea Park in Kula. </p>

<p>Maui Civil Defense officials announced this morning that their Emergency Operation Center is activated at Level 3, which would be to monitor the situation countywide. </p>

<p>The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the island of Maui at 8:24 a.m. The warning is in effect until 11:15 a.m. but may be extended if flooding persists. </p>

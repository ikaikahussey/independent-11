<p>WAILUKU&#8212;Maui County Mayor-elect Alan Arakawa announced on Monday his re-appointment of Rob Parsons as the incoming environmental coordinator.</p>

<p>As Maui County&#8217;s first Environmental Coordinator, Parsons established close working relationships with the State Department of Land and Natural Resources, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Maui Invasive Species Council, EPA, watershed protection organizations, and dozens of other community-based environmental groups, and governmental agencies, Arakawa said.</p>

<p>Parsons helped to initiate and monitor the &#8220;Pump Don&#8217;t Dump&#8221; for Maalaea boaters to protect ocean resources from wastewater dumping, assisted with the coastal acquisition of 277 acres at Waihee and 73 acres at Muolea Point in Hana, began hands-on wetlands restoration efforts at Laie in central Kihei, and helped with rapid-response to the wiliwili gall wasp infestation.</p>

<p>Parsons also aided with planning and implementation for the Appliance Recycle weekend that resulted in citizens sending 55 shipping containers to Oahu for processing while Maui struggled with having no state-approved metal recycling facility for two years.</p>

<p>During the past four years, Parsons worked with national consumer advocate Food and Water Watch as Hawaii liaison on open ocean aquaculture issues and served as a member of Maui County Renewable Energy Alliance. </p>

<p>&#8220;A healthy environment enhances everyone&#8217;s quality of life&#8212;visitors, residents, indeed all living species,&#8221; Parsons said. &#8220;I encourage everyone to participate, and to offer their input as to where the Arakawa administration&#8217;s environmental efforts are needed most. This kind out community input and outreach is essential.&#8221;</p>

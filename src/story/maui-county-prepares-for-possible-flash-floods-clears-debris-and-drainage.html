<p>WAILUKU, Maui&#8212;Maui County Civil Defense, the Department of Public Works, and the Maui Police Department are on high alert for possible flash floods over the next several days.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/flash-flood-wednesday-thursday/" title="The National Weather Service is predicting heavy rains">The National Weather Service is predicting heavy rains</a> due to an approaching cold front from the northwest. Thunderstorms are expected Wednesday and Thursday for the western part of the state.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>In response, Maui County officials held an emergency meeting this afternoon to coordinate efforts of all the departments. The County wants to be prepared for other potential flood situations like that which hit South Maui last month.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;People were caught by surprise when the floods hit last time,&#8221; said County Council member Don Couch, who represents the South Maui area. &#8220;I want to let the community that we are doing everything that we can possibly do to prepare for a possible flood.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Police are monitoring the situation and are ready to redirect traffic or redirect traffic becomes necessary.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Public Works officials say crews have cleaned debris out of culverts and drainage from Maalaea to Wailea since the flooding last month. They include the Waiakoa, Kulanihakoi, and Waipuilani gulches along with the Keokea Reservation Resivoir which runs past St. Theresa&#8217;s Church in Kihei.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Officials said the gulches overflowed because rain Upcountry washed down all sorts of debris which residents may have been thrown into area ditches.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Workers found bicycles and furniture among the trees and branches blocking the culverts. They are urging residents to use the county landfill in the future if they need to throw away their unwanted property.</p>

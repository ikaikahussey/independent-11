<p>WAILUKU, MAUI – The <a href="http://www.co.maui.hi.us/index.aspx?nid=141" target="_blank">Maui County Office of Economic Development</a> (OED) has announced that it has purchased ten booths at the <a href="http://www.theflowershow.com/home/index.html" target="_blank">Philadelphia International Flower Show</a>, held from March 4 to 11, 2012.&nbsp; The theme of the flower show this year is “Hawai`i, Islands of Aloha.” </p>

<p>The show is the largest fresh flower &amp; products show in North America, with approximately 300,000 people attending the nine-day event.&nbsp; The flower show organizers have offered vendors from all counties in Hawai`i a “Hawai`i Market Place” which will be designed to showcase local Hawai`i made products and cultural crafts.&nbsp; Hawai`i Tourism Authority and the Maui Visitor’s Bureau will also be participating in the show to promote Hawai`i and Maui County. </p>

<p>Maui County is now soliciting local vendors who want to participate in this opportunity and sell their products at this show.&nbsp; In addition to the booth space, the Office of Economic Development will be offering each company who qualifies an assistance package to help defray costs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Products that are eligible are Maui County made food products, cultural crafts, Hawaiian music CD’s, fresh flowers or packaged nursery products, value added soaps &amp; lotions, fresh fruit, packaged coffee etc.&nbsp; The county will pick a diverse group of vendors that have a large quantity of product that will be ready to ship to Philadelphia in March.&nbsp; The requirements are that 51% of the value of the product must have been derived within Maui County, and the company must have a website with an active shopping cart.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“The purpose of promoting our companies to these new mainland buyers is to entice them to re-order from our companies’ shopping carts in the future,” said Teena Rasmussen, OED Coordinator.&nbsp; “Without the shopping cart requirement, there would be no mechanism to gain future business from this endeavor.”</p>

<p>A special informational meeting is scheduled on Sept. 7, 2010 at 8 a.m.&nbsp; in the Mayor’s Lounge on the 9th floor of the County building.&nbsp; Interested companies are urged to attend this meeting as the County vendor list of participants must be completed by October 1st. </p>

<p>For further information or for interested companies from Lanai and Molokai, interested parties can call the Maui County Office of Economic Development at 270-7710.</p>

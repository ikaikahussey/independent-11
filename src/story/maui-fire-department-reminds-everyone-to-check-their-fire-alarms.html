<p>MAUI&#8212;A Waiehu man’s escape from a burning home Sunday has prompted the Maui Fire Department (MFD) to remind everyone to check their smoke detectors.</p>

<p>MFD reports that 84-year-old Rick Liserr was asleep in his single story home at 1356 Hiahia St. when he was roused awake by his smoke detector going off sometime prior to 12:27 p.m. Liserr managed to exit the house and escape injury although the fire caused a total of $400,000 damage to the house and contents.</p>

<p>Had the smoke detector not gone off Liserr might have not been able to escape injury, or worse. In light of this incident, MFD is urging everyone to check their smoke detectors at least once a month and to change their batteries at least once a year.<br />
 <br />
“Everyone is very happy that Mr. Liserr made it out of his home okay,” said MFD Fire Chief Jeff Murray. “Make sure your smoke detector is working properly and know what to do if one is activated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cause of the fire is under investigation although it is believed to be accidental. Investigators said most likely it began due to an electrical short in the garage.</p>

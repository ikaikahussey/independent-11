<p>WAILUKU, MAUI &#8212; The Aloha Initiative co-founder Keith Regan has announced that community meetings are scheduled on Sunday, May 1, at 3 p.m. at Kahului Hongwanji Mission social hall and Tuesday, May 3, at 6:30 p.m. at Door of Faith Church to provide information to prospective host families and other volunteers wanting to help with The Aloha Initiative, a project led by the Japanese Cultural Society of Maui to provide citizens of Japan who have been displaced by the recent earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis with a warm and welcoming home. </p>

<p>The meetings will include a presentation by Dr. Al Arensdorf, a Red Cross trainer in disaster mental health and in psychological first aid, on what to expect, how to use an evidence-based intervention called “Psychological First Aid” both for host families and disaster workers and for persons displaced by disaster, and tips for both adults and children as to how to cope and how to recover by being resilient.</p>

<p>Members of The Aloha Intiative returned from the Tohoku region of Japan last Friday after meeting with government and nonprofit organization leaders there to discuss disaster relief. A press conference was held in Fukushima City and, since then, the program has received TV and newspaper exposure in Japan.&nbsp; The tremendous publicity has resulted in The Aloha Initiative phone in Japan ringing off the hook with inquiries and requests to sign up for the program.</p>

<p>To date, over 130 families throughout Hawaii have signed up to open their hearts and homes to the people of Japan, and over $150,000 in pledges has been received to help defray the transportation and insurance costs.&nbsp; “More host families and donations are needed to meet the demand,” said co-founder Lynn Araki-Regan.</p>

<p>Students from several Maui schools donated handmade gifts to the children of the Tohoku region. “When we presented the gifts to those living in the extremely chilly shelters, they were extremely touched,” said Regan.&nbsp; <br />

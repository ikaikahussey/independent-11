<p>WAILUKU&#8212;Maui Mayor-elect Alan Arakawa appointed Douglas P. McLeod as energy commissioner of Maui County.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>McLeod is a graduate of The Johns Hopkins University and formerly practiced as an environmental lawyer. As an attorney, McLeod worked on energy generation, transmission, and storage issues throughout the country. He also has experience developing renewable energy projects in Hawaii and on the Mainland, including both net metered solar pv projects and the new Feed In Tariff solar pv systems. </p>

<p>On Maui, McLeod built two commercial buildings using &#8220;green&#8221; principles, and his Two Daughters Building in Kihei is a leading example of energy efficient building practices, Arakawa said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maui County is on the leading edge of renewable energy development, and I hope to help Mayor-elect Arakawa find ways for these projects to benefit the people of Maui, Molokai, and Lanai in terms of economic development and jobs,&#8221; McLeod said. &#8220;We will also work to identify County-owned facilites that are good candidates for renwable energy systems so that the cost of operating government buildings will be as low as possible.&#8221;</p>

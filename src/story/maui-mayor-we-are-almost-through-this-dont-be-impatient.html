<p>WAILUKU, Maui&#8212;Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa is urging residents to stay away from evacuated areas which are still being hit by the tsunami.</p>

<p>Waves are flooding streets, overflowing sewage lines and leaving dirt, leaves, coconuts and other debris strewn everywhere. Affected areas include Kihei, Kahului, Lahaina and Maalaea.</p>

<p>Maui police have blocked off these areas but some motorists are still trying to drive through. In one instance a police officer had to chase down a car and knock on the driver&#8217;s window to get him to stop and go around a flooded street.</p>

<p>&#8220;The threat of the tsunami is not yet over,&#8221; said Mayor Arakawa. &#8220;Residents and tourists will know when they can go back to their homes and hotels because we will give them an all clear signal. </p>

<p>&#8220;We are almost through this. Don&#8217;t be impatient because that could result in someone getting hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roads are likely to remain closed for another hour at least.</p>

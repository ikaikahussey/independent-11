<p>Wailuku, MAUI&#8212;Last month, Maui County Mayor Alan Arakawa challenged Maui County departments as well as the island&#8217;s businesses, community groups, and schools to take action in helping Japan&#8217;s citizens who were displaced by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster.</p>

<p>Arakawa asked Maui residents to participate by encouraging their employees, students, and friends to make a donation to The Aloha Initiative project, a fundraising effort that had donors wearing jeans during a designated time period.</p>

<p>Organizers of the Aloha Initiative announced that over $35,000 has been received through the &#8220;Wear Jeans for Japan&#8221; fundraising efforts. </p>

<p>Out of the total funds received, Mana Foods donated $20,000 through donations made by its customers, employees, and owners and generated the most donations per employee. Arakawa presented the &#8220;Wear Jeans for Japan&#8221; award to Theresa and Edward Thielk, Mana Foods owners.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so grateful to Mana Foods and the various entities for their generosity and support. Special thanks to Carden Academy and Mary Lynne Goode for helping to coordinate this unique and successful fundraising project as well as generating donations for The Aloha Initiative project,&#8221; said Tiffany Iida, president of the Japanese Cultural Society of Maui, the nonprofit organization leading the fundraising effort.</p>

<p>The Aloha Initiative program will provide citizens of Japan displaced by the March earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis with a home in the islands beginning in early July. </p>

<p>Japan residents selected for the program will be done on the basis of greatest personal need and circumstance. Those chosen will be flown to Hawaii and spend up to 90 days with host families willing to take the displaced residents in and provide them with a warm, nurturing environment during their time of crisis. The Aloha Initiative will pay for ground and air transportation to and from Hawaii.</p>

<p>While over $115,000 has been raised to date, The Aloha Initiative Honorary Chair Arakawa said that more money needed to support this overwhelming effort. Those interested in making a contribution to The Aloha Initiative may do so at any First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii, Guam, and CNMI through June 30.</p>

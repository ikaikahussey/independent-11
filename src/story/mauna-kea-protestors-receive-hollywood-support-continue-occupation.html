<p>As momentum builds and protestors receive continued support in their efforts to block construction of the Thirty-Meter Telescope, the mountain&#8217;s &#8220;protectors&#8221; say they have no plans to leave their encampment at the Mauna Kea Visitors Center, approximately 9,200 feet above sea level. They will soon reach the two week mark of their encampment. </p>

<p>Although more than 30 arrests were made on Thursday, April 2, by the Hawaii County Police Department in conjunction with the Department of Land and Natural Resources&#8217; Division of Conservation and Resource Enforcement, the protectors (as they are being referred to on social media) of the sacred mountain continue their stand against the construction of the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) and continue to build momentum and gain support. Yesterday, actor Jason Momoa (<em>Stargate: Atlantis, Game of Thrones</em>), who is Samoan and Native American, posted a picture on Instagram expressing solidarity for the protestors:</p>

<p>One reason for the building of momentum and support, say protestors, is what they are calling Kapu Aloha. “Abiding by this is what has fueled and protected us in this movement,” says Lanakila Mangauil. Mangauil says the Kapu Aloha is about conducting oneself with respect towards others, under any and all circumstances. </p>

<p>Over the weekend, hundreds of supporters ascended the mountain to join in the protection efforts, with many flying in from Maui, Molokai, Oahu and Kauai. Although no construction has taken place since the day arrests were made, the protestors have no plans to vacate their camp.<br />
 <br />
Protectors of the mountain have many reasons why they oppose the proposed construction of the TMT, one being that the mountain is considered sacred (perhaps the most sacred site in all of Hawaii). The mountain is named after Wākea who mated with Papahānaumoku to birth Hawaii Island. The peak of the mountain is considered to be wao akua, or the realm of the gods, as it is the dwelling place of gods and goddesses such as Poliahu, Waiau, Lilinoe, Lihau, Kukahauula, Kahoupokane and Mooinanea.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Another reason for the opposition to the TMT is the fact that protectors feel that the TMT does not adhere to the developmental laws of conservation lands as determined by the State of Hawaii. The mountain contains many religious shrines as well as burial sites and sits on top of the largest aquifer on the island of Hawaii. </p>

<p>Lastly, some protestors argue that, even if the TMT was in compliance with the laws of developing on conservation lands, the State of Hawaii is illegal, as the Hawaiian Kingdom was never lawfully annexed by the United States of America and, therefore, continues to exist today according to International Law. This stems from the fact that Americaʻs only claim to annexing Hawaii is by a Joint Resolution passed on July 7, 1898. Joint Resolutions are domestic laws with no authority outside the boundaries of the authorizing nation&#8217;s territory. Because the State of Hawaii is viewed as illegal, the protestors argue that every extension and branch of the State is therefore also illegal, and all contracts between the TMT corporation and the State of Hawaii are void. </p>

<p>The protestors have received support in the form of donations of food, water, money and other necessities and, while these donations are appreciated, those atop the mountain are asking that any attempts at raising funds and collecting and delivering donations be communicated with them first, so as not to mismanage resources and cause confusion amongst the people with regards to what funds and donations can be used for.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Kahoʻokahi Kanuha, one of the protestors who was arrested in the first group last Thursday, says, “We canʻt thank everyone enough. The amount of support we have received over the past week is absolutely unbelievable and simply amazing. I am not quite sure our people have seen a movement like this in their lifetime and I think itʻs a testament to the fact that our people have been ignited and are ready to move forward and solidify ourselves once again throughout the world as a people and a country.”</p>

<p>Give the woman who has the toughest job in the world a night of laughter and celebrate your mom at Capone&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day Comedy Smash. The all-star cast features the hottest comedian today, Tracy Morgan from NBC&#8217;s  Emmy-winning sitcom &#8220;30 Rock,&#8221; plus Comedy Central&#8217;s Lavell Crawford and Jeremiah J.J.

<p>Mom and her guests are sure to laugh out loud as Tracy Morgan makes his first ever appearance in Hawaii. The comedian can currently be seen in Kevin Smith&#8217;s new comedy &#8220;Cop Out&#8221; starring Bruce Willis and next month can be seen in the comedy &#8220;Death At A Funeral&#8221; featuring Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Zoe Saldana and Danny Glover. Then later this year Morgan appears alongside Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal in the independent romantic comedy &#8220;Nailed.&#8221; Most people will remember Morgan from his days with &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; where he appeared for seven seasons and created such memorable characters as &#8220;Astronaut Jones&#8221; and &#8220;Brain Fellows.&#8221;</p>

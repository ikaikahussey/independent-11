<p>Mayor Peter Carlisle and top City officials joined the <a href="http://www.hawaiifoodbank.org" target="_blank">Hawaii Foodbank</a> at Honolulu Hale today to stuff a City bus with donated food items and raise public awareness about hunger in Hawaii.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, more than ever, the hungry of Hawaii need our help,&#8221; said Carlisle, who proclaimed April 2011 as &#8220;Food Drive Month.&#8221; &#8220;The Hawaii Foodbank&#8217;s mission is to help ensure that no one goes hungry, and it&#8217;s very important for all of us to assist in any way we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The City and County of Honolulu kicked off its annual food drive in February, and hopes to raise more than 12,000 pounds of food and $10,000 for the Hawaii Foodbank by April 16. The Honolulu Fire Department will be accepting non-perishable food donations from the community at all neighborhood fire stations from April 1 through April 30, Mon. through Fri., 8 am to 5 pm.</p>

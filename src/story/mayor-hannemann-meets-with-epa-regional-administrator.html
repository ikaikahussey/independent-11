<p>Mayor Mufi Hannemann met in San Francisco with the new EPA Region IX Administrator Jared Blumenfeld on Monday, March 15.</p>

<p>The meeting covered the City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Wastewater program and consent decree negotiations.</p>

<p>Since 2005, the City has dedicated more than a billion dollars to its wastewater program.&nbsp; Another $1.6 billion in wastewater improvements is planned over the next five years.</p>

<p>Sewage spills, also called Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSO) in calendar year 2009 declined 17.3 percent compared to 2008. Last year, ENV recorded 101 total SSOs from gravity mains, lower laterals, pump stations, pretreatment facilities and force mains, compared to 122 in 2008.</p>

<p>Hannemann said that Administrator Blumenfeld plans to visit Honolulu later this month to continue the dialogue between the City and the EPA.&nbsp; At that time, Blumenfeld is expected to  present the City and County of Honolulu with three EPA awards, including two Energy Star awards for efficiency at both the Fasi Municipal Building and Honolulu Hale, and the $499,000 EPA Climate Showcase Community Grant.</p>

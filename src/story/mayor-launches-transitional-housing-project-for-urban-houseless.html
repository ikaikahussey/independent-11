"teaser":"The city is soliciting bids for a transitional housing project in urban Honolulu.  <blockquote> The City has issued a Request for Proposals to invite agencies interested in partnering on the project, and will provide $3.5 million from the City's Affordable Housing Fund to acquire and/or renovate an existing structure to provide transitional housing to homeless persons with special needs. A specific project site has not been identified. Funds will be awarded to a nonprofit agency that will be responsible for working with neighborhoods in urban Honolulu to obtain a community consensus that The Pathways Project is an acceptable means to address homelessness in their neighborhood. A specific project site will be identified to implement the project only after a positive community consensus has been achieved. </blockquote>",

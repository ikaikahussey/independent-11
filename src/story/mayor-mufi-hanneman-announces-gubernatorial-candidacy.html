<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Preceded by a sentimental speech by one of his primary school teachers, Mayor Mufi Hannemann made official his gubernatorial candidacy at Fern Elementary in Kalihi late yesterday afternoon. The press conference had been postponed, originally announced for 2:00 pm. </p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome to my part of the hood,&#8221; he said, welcoming more than 200 of his supporters gathered at lunch tables in the cafeteria. SHOPO and a handful of other labor unions were on hand and thanked for their efforts on behalf of his electoral aspirations.</p>

<p>Hannemann&#8217;s tone was hopeful and humble as he spoke of his roots and admitted to being &#8220;the spoiled one in the family.&#8221; Education was forefront among the issues he spoke on, with a healthy state economy and sound environmental policy also addressed specifically.</p>

<p>Using familiar and colorful local colloquialisms like &#8220;akamai&#8221; and &#8220;paddle the canoe,&#8221; Hannemann presented himself as a grassroots-minded candidate and identified with an understanding of the importance of stable families. He stressed the importance of promise fulfillment and of leaving Hawaii &#8220;better than we found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following his announcement, Hannemann made a candidate&#8217;s walk through the crowd, shaking hands, hugging, and smiling. The earnest campaigning began shortly after the press conference, as he and fellow candidate Neil Abercrombie exchanged sharp soundbites over the race for the governorship, presumably over Twitter and other social media before the evening broadcast news.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In the latest effort to keep Hawaii&#8217;s &#8220;homeless problem&#8221; out of site, Honolulu Mayor Peter Carlisle today signed into law <a href="http://docsiis01:8080/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-181386/039(10),%20CD1,%20FD2.pdf" title="Bill 39">Bill 39</a>, which establishes “Pedestrian Use Zones” that reserve substantial portions of City sidewalks for pedestrians in high pedestrian traffic areas.</p>

<p>On the surface, the City&#8217;s description of the bill makes it sound like Hawaii has a serious foot-traffic problem, with the Pedestrian Use Zones clearing the way for Honolulu&#8217;s citizens as they walk to work or do their shopping. Opponents to the bill call it simply another <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/comment-relating-to-the-regulation-of-the-poor-and-unwashed/" title="&quot;homeless ban.&quot;">&#8220;homeless ban&#8221;</a>&#8212;not unlike the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j21HmgFt8sE" title="recent law">recent law</a> banning tents and shopping carts in Honolulu&#8217;s parks.</p>

<p>Bill 39, introduced by Councilmember Ann Kobayashi, prohibits the storage of personal property within a Pedestrian Use Zone, defined as the portion of a sidewalk that extends toward the street up to eight feet from the adjacent private or public property line bordering the sidewalk opposite the curb.</p>

<p>The restrictions will not apply to persons unable to comply due to suffering a medical emergency; or engaged in other activities such as waiting at a bus stop or taxi stand; or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, or similar event conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to and in compliance with an applicable permit.</p>

<p>Pedestrian Use Zones will be established primarily in Honolulu&#8217;s most precious tourist shopping commodities: Ala Moana/Kakaako; Downtown; Kalihi; McCully/Moiliili/Makiki; and Waikiki. The restrictions will apply between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. except in Waikiki, where they will apply between 6:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. of the succeeding day. </p>

<p>Upon conviction, violators&#8212;houseless people targeted by the law&#8212;may be fined a maximum of $50 or be sentenced to community service for a time period determined by a judge.</p>

<p>The measure appears to be one that makes more of a moral statement, such as the smoking-near-a-doorway law, than one that will immediately see Honolulu&#8217;s houseless swept from City streets. Carlisle cautioned that &#8220;resource constraints limit the City’s ability to implement the measure’s requirements immediately in all areas.&#8221; The City will conduct an educational and warning program prior to enforcement.<br />
 <br />
The City Council approved Bill 39 on October 13 by a vote of 5 to 4. The measure will take effect in 60 days, and is <a href="http://docsiis01:8080/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-181386/039(10),%20CD1,%20FD2.pdf" title="available here.">available here.</a></p>

<p>During a declared statewide &#8220;homeless&#8221; crisis that is facing a shortage of affordable housing and shelter space, Oahu&#8217;s houseless population has been banned from beaches, parks, and now city streets. Where will they end up? The answer will likely come via a testifier&#8217;s complaint at the next Neighborhood Board meeting or committee hearing&#8212;unless our communities and elected officials enact real solutions to the multitude of problems that lead to houselessness.</p>

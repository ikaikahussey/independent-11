<p>HONOLULU, HAWAI‘I—On Monday, May 13 at 5:30 p.m., Mayor Kirk Caldwell and Honolulu Museum of Art director Stephan Jost host a community forum regarding Thomas Square.</p>

<p>Thomas Square, along with other public areas where the island’s homeless have gravitated, has become a hot topic among Honolulu citizens, and public and private agencies are beginning to mobilize to address the issue.</p>

<p>“My vision for Thomas Square is to develop the park as the crown jewel in a new Culture and Arts District for the City and County of Honolulu,” says Mayor Caldwell. “This is a priority for me, but it’s also important that we work closely and communicate with the neighbors on each side of the park. Recent events have shone a bright light on the problems within the park, and it is an opportunity for all of us to work hard and come together with some creative solutions. I am very excited about the potential to revive and beautify Thomas Square, especially since we are coming up on an important anniversary.&nbsp; This park, with its rich history and beautiful design, deserves nothing less.”</p>

<p>As director of one of the park’s neighbors, Jost receives feedback about Thomas Square. “Many people have told me about their ideas for the future of Thomas Square,” says Jost. “People want it to be a place they can be proud of and where they can bring their family and friends. Since the park functions as the front yard of the museum in many ways, we are very interested in seeing the park thrive. Additionally, the park is one of Hawai‘i’s most significant historic sites and deserves to be celebrated and respected.”</p>

<p>The community forum will open with a moderated open microphone to solicit ideas from the community about what Thomas Square could be in the future. Then Mayor Caldwell will talk about his vision for the park.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.&#8212;U.S. Representative Mazie Hirono has won bipartisan support for an amendment she introduced to the 2012 Agriculture Approriations Bill that restores $3 million in funding to the Watershed and Flood Prevention Program. The amendment passed by a vote of 288-132, with 107 Republicans voting in favor. Congresswoman Hirono’s was one of only three Democratic amendments to the bill, which passed by a recorded vote.</p>

<p>“This program supports our state and local governments’ ability to improve agricultural water delivery systems for farmers in Hawaii, especially along the Hamakua Coast of Hawaii Island and in upcountry Maui, and in developing flood protection infrastructure for Hilo and Lahaina,” Hirono said.</p>

<p>The federal program focuses on water development and conservation projects in authorized watersheds as well as projects to prevent erosion, floodwater, and sediment damage.</p>

<p>Hawaii currently has four authorized projects under this program with federal funding commitments of $34 million.&nbsp; The projects are as follows:</p>

<p>•
The Upcountry Maui Watershed (irrigation) project will benefit more than 170 farmers with approximately 500 acres of high-value truck and ornamental crops.</p>

<p>•
The Lower Hamakua Ditch Watershed project is projected to eventually irrigate approximately 2,500 acres of cropland.</p>

<p>•
The Lahaina Watershed project will protect about 200 homes, 35 condominiums, 160 commercial buildings, and 4 public facilities within the floodplain.&nbsp; Hotels, recreation, and other visitor industries will also benefit from reduced sedimentation along the shore.</p>

<p>•
The current project area of the Wailuku-Alenaio watershed encompasses approximately 540 acres of rural and agricultural lands in the Kaumana Drive area of Hilo. Approximately 62 percent of the project area is in agricultural use, 16 percent in residential use, and 22 percent in public and other land uses.</p>

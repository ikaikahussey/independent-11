<p>LAIE&#8212;A community-wide meeting will be held on Tuesday, December 7 at 6:30 p.m. in the Kahuku High School Cafeteria to present the public a review draft of the revised Koolau Loa Sustainable Communities Plan and receive comments.</p>

<p>The draft revised plan was released in October 2010 and addresses the need for jobs and affordable workforce housing within the region by including a new community in Malaekahana and expansion of Brigham Young University and the Polynesian Cultural Center in Laie. The draft revised plan also recognizes Turtle Bay Resort’s existing land use entitlements. These issues need to be examined and evaluated in the review process, as community consensus has not been reached.</p>

<p>After comments on this public draft are received and evaluated, the department will prepare an updated version to be submitted to the Planning Commission for review, potential revisions, and approval at a public meeting where the public may testify. The plan then goes to the City Council for further review, potential revisions and final approval at another public meeting where the public may testify.</p>

<p>The Koolau Loa Plan is one of eight regional plans, which guide land use and infrastructure investments for the City and County of Honolulu. The Koolau Loa Plan was first adopted by the City Council in 1999, and the revision will update land use policies and the community vision for the region. Key elements of the plan cover protection of natural, recreational, and cultural resources; agriculture and sustainability; keeping the country “country”; enhancement of commercial areas; and the provision of adequate infrastructure.</p>

<p><i>The draft revised plan and additional information are available at <a href="http://www.honoluludpp.org/planning" title="www.honoluludpp.org/planning">www.honoluludpp.org/planning</a>. Comments on the plan should be sent by January 15, 2011 to Helber Hastert &amp; Fee Planners at info@hhf.com. For more information, call (808) 545-2055. </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Out with the storm, in with the vog and the high surf. Surf is way up in Hawaii this Christmas Day weekend. The National Weather Service in Honolulu issued a high surf advisory for north and east facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii Island through 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 26.</p>

<p>Surf along north facing shores will rise to heights of 10 to 16 feet. Surf along east facing shores exposed to the north swell will rise to heights of 8 to 12 feet.</p>

<p>Inexperienced swimmers should avoid entering the water along north and east facing shores. The swell will produce strong rip currents that can overpower even strong swimmers.</p>

<p>A high surf advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in the advisory area producing large breaking waves, dangerous rip currents, and localized beach erosion.</p>

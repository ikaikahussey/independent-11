<p><i>Merry Christmas Roberta</i> is a heartwarming drama about friendship, forgiveness, and the love of family. Inspired by the &#8220;homeless&#8221; and small business owners who share Honolulu’s Chinatown, <i>Roberta</i> premiered in 2008, receiving Pookela awards for Best Overall Play and Featured Female in a Play. Put on by <a href="http://www.taghawaii.net/OurHistory.html" title="The Actor's Group">The Actor&#8217;s Group</a> (TAG), the play returns this holiday season with two of the principal actors from the original production.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The non-profit organization provides respite for those who are unsheltered and offers solutions that transform the lives of &#8220;homeless&#8221; and at-risk people. IHS remains the only 24-hour walk-in, emergency shelter on Oahu and continues to provide a full range of services to men, women, and families with children who are homeless and in danger of becoming homeless. The agency operates two facilities in Honolulu, one for men at 350 Sumner Street, capable of serving up to 200 men each night, and the other, for women and families, at 546 Kaaahi Street, serving up to 100 single women and 23-27 families with as many as 60 children daily. The agency strives to be ADA compliant and will make reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>TAG has provided more than a decade of theatre in Hawaii and remains a focal point for actors and audiences looking for straight theatre excellence. Based in Downtown Honolulu, the performers and volunteers at TAG are looking to contribute to helping Hawaii&#8217;s &#8220;homeless&#8221; through the arts.</p>

<p><i>Merry Christmas Roberta</i>&#8216;s dramatic content is recommended for mature audiences as a tale that will tug at your heart strings and warm your spirits for the holiday season.</p>

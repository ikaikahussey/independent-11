<p>HONOLULU &#8212; <a href="http://www.korn.com" target="_blank">Korn</a>, a heavy metal band that rocketed to fame with the release of their eponymous debut album in 1994 , will play its first show in Hawaii at Blasdell Arena on Tuesday, August 16. Also appearing will be the outfit <a href="http://www.fivefingerdeathpunch.com/" target="_blank">Five Finger Death Punch</a>.</p>

<p>Korn has faced controversy over lyrics that have been deemed by critics as offensive, vulgar, and obscene. Despite that controversy, Korn has won six Grammy Awards over the years. The Bakersfield, California band has sold over 40 million records worldwide.</p>

<p>With influences as diverse as Sepultura and Pink Floyd, Korn incorporates elements of hip hip into their sound, most recently working with dub-step artist Skrillex on their latest release “Get Up.”</p>

<p>Tickets for the concert will go on sale July 1. For tickets, visit <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com." target="_blank">www.ticketmaster.com.</a></p>

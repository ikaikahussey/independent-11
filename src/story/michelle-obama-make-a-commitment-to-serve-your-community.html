<p><i>Earlier today, First Lady Michelle Obama sent this message to the White House email list about the <a href="http://Serve.gov" title="September 11 National Day of Service">September 11 National Day of Service</a>:</i></p>

<p>Nine years ago, nearly three thousand Americans lost their lives on September 11, 2001. Like many Americans, I was shocked and horrified by the attacks on our country. But I was also inspired by the heroism and selflessness of so many of my fellow Americans in the wake of this tragedy.</p>

<p>From the brave men and women of Flight 93 who sacrificed their own lives to save the lives of others, to the first responders who rushed without hesitation to help those in need, to the young men and women who chose to join our Armed Forces following the attacks&#8212;these tragic events united Americans in a remarkable spirit of solidarity and compassion.</p>

<p>It’s that spirit of selflessness and service that inspired the first September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance last year. On this day all Americans can honor the brave men and women who lost and risked their lives by serving others in their community. </p>

<p>Tomorrow, I will be volunteering with Mission Serve, an initiative bringing together civilian and military communities through service and volunteerism. Working alongside active duty members of the military, wounded warriors, veterans, military spouses and students, I’ll help renovate a community center at a retirement community for veterans in McLean, Virginia.</p>

<p>You can join me in participating in the National Day of Service by finding a service opportunity in your area on <a href="http://Serve.gov" title="Serve.gov">Serve.gov</a>:</p>

<p>Whether you help clean up a local park, participate in a food drive, or help out in a local soup kitchen or school, volunteering strengthens our communities and our country. The National Day of Service presents an opportunity to take time to make a difference in your area and make a commitment to serve your community throughout the year.</p>

<p>On the anniversary of this tragic day in our history, I hope you will join me in honoring all those who put the needs of others before their own by serving in your community. </p>

<p>To all Americans mourning the loss of their loved ones on September 11, the President and I extend our sincerest condolences. Your courage and sacrifice is an inspiration to all Americans. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><i>Michelle Obama<br />
First Lady of the United States</i></p>

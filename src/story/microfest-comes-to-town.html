<p>How does art impact our community?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the question being asked by Network of Ensemble Theater&#8217;s MicroFest USA initiative. Over the past two years, that national coalition of ensemble artists has produced &#8220;MicroFests&#8221; in Detroit, Michigan; Harlan County, Kentucky; New Orleans, Louisiana; and now, Honolulu.</p>

<p>From June 13th to the 18th, MicroFest will lead participants on a journey across the island of O‘ahu, with a series of events aimed at connecting how arts influences communities and urban environments.<br />
 <br />
Local partners include PA‘I Foundation and the Honolulu Theatre for Youth. Events will take place at 808 Urban, The Arts at Mark&#8217;s Garage, the Bishop Museum, Ke Kula ‘o Samuel M. Kamakau, Halau Ku Mana, He Hawai’i Au Farm, and Catholic Charities. </p>

<p>A full schedule of MicroFest events are available <a href="http://www.ensembletheaters.net/content/schedule">here</a>.</p>

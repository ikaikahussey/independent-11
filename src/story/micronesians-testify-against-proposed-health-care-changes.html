<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Testifiers at a January 25 Department of Human Services (DHS) meeting on proposed changes to health care rules were concerned about sufficiently voicing their testimony due to miscommunication and a lack of translators.</p>

<p>DHS employees divided approximately 100 testifiers at Monday&#8217;s meeting in the Liliuokalani Building into two groups in separate rooms to expedite the process. However there was only one translator on hand who stayed in only one of the rooms. DHS said testimony could be translated at a later date.</p>

<p>Following a ruling in December by Circuit Court Judge Gary W.B. Chang, the State is required to follow procedures that will allow for pubic comment and criticism of the proposed rules regarding the level of benefits for Hawaii residents from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau.</p>

<p>Citizens of these nations are allowed to travel, work, and reside in the United States as part of the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) with the United States.</p>

<p>The state&#8217;s proposed rule changes would limit current state funded medical assistance through QUEST, QUEST Expanded Access, QUEST-Net, QUEST-ACE, fee-for-service, and SHOTT programs to citizens of a COFA nation who are under 19 years of age or is pregnant or for emergency services. All other citizens of COFA nations would have to rely on a new plan called Basic Health Hawaii.</p>

<p>The new plan covers up to 12 outpatient doctor visits, 10 hospital days, six mental health visits, and five generic prescription drugs a month. However, the services do not cover preventive care such as regular dialysis and chemotherapy treatments.</p>

<p>Testifiers said that by refusing them access to QUEST, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to receive preventive care treatments and would likely die.</p>

<p>The governor has said that Basic Health Hawaii, offered to 7,000 Micronesians, will save the state $15 million. Basic Health Hawaii is expected to be implemented no later than July 1, 2010.</p>

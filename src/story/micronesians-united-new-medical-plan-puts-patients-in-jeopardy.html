<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Members of Micronesians United showed up to the office of the governor today to protest the new medical plan that will be offered to 7,500 Micronesians part of the Compact of Free Association. </p>

<p>Gov. Linda Lingle has said the new plan starting on September 1, Basic Health Hawaii, will save the State $15 million. The new plan covers up to 12 outpatient doctor visits, 10 hospital days, six mental health visits, and five generic prescription drugs a month. However, the services do not cover preventive care such as regular dialysis and chemotherapy treatments. </p>

<p>Micronesians United has said that many patients who rely on preventive care were not given enough notice to adapt to the new plan and had requested that the governor postpone Basic Health Hawaii.</p>

<p>Lingle did not come out to see the members of Micronesians United. A member from the governor&#8217;s office said she was in a meeting.</p>

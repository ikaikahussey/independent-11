<p><b>Why are you running for office?</b><br />
The people of Puna and Kau have been looked over, passed by, and otherwise ignored. Someone needs to step up. I’m motivated by recent local and world events and feel the time is now. I have passion to do the right thing. I’m not afraid. I have creative solutions to our problems. I communicate well. I am skilled in financial planning, business planning, negotiation, and public speaking. I believe violence and prejudice is wrong. I believe the universe and people are good. We can find common ground. We must make our decisions with love not fear.</p>

<p>Current representation is docile and content. I’ll ensure our government doesn’t forget our rights: to ensure the citizens breathe clean air, drink clean water, eat healthy foods, have adequate shelter, are provided freedom to prosper and pursue happiness, and educate all to their fullest potential. This is the government’s role. Lacking these is government failure. </p>

<p>I have every intention of winning this race and fighting for the people of State Senate District 2 .</p>

<p>I’m passionate about helping small and micro businesses to start, survive, grow, and thrive and protecting our environment and the key to it all is education. Using the rapid advances in technology and breakthroughs with charter schools we can really make a difference but we&#8217;ve got to be willing. Vote don&#8217;t be ignored.</p>

<p><b>What is the single most important issue for your constituents?</b><br />
Business Economy Environment = BEE sustainable</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
Solutions are intertwined with the issues. Property Accessed Clean Energy (PACE), for instance, would potentially take our homes off oil rapidly, saving millions of our people money that currently goes to off island oil. Not to mention putting contractors to work for installations. Who is holding it up? Banks and our current legislators are.</p>

<p>* Education to the public. <br />
* How to grow your own food.<br />
* How to conserve energy.<br />
* How to reduce reuse and recycle better.<br />
* How to start your own micro business and many other higher learning opportunities.</p>

<p>If we keep our money on the islands, in our pockets, or spend it with our neighbors there will also be a multiplier effect. All these things are win-win-win solutions.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
Myself. I haven&#8217;t solicited any funds. I also haven&#8217;t ever received money from RJ Reynolds, Dupont, Monsanto or any other off-Island Company. I have had three people request to give a contribution: Roger Christie, a realtor, and a friend who is a member of the carpenters union for a total of less than $100.</p>

<p><b>Who do you plan on including in your staff?</b><br />
Motivated people who have the skills I lack. I have my eye on a few people who are running in other races. I plan on working with both parties while in office and I may even have a bipartisan staff. Send resumes to mik3hal3@gmail.com.</p>

<p><b>What’s your strategy in dealing with the &#8220;homeless&#8221;?</b><br />
&#8220;Homelessness&#8221; is a complex issue, but the solutions are within our reach. Current outreach programs need more support. We have empty houses and empty buildings. We have the space for them but somehow the money is held up. We have programs currently in place with money for the &#8220;homeless.&#8221; And we have people losing their homes. Why? Our government agencies need to work closer with the current organizations out there to fill the gaps.</p>

<p>To ensure that our citizens can breath clean air, drink clean water, eat healthy foods, provide adequate shelter, provide freedom to prosper, and pursue happiness and educate all to their fullest potential&#8212;this is the government&#8217;s role! I will ensure our government doesn&#8217;t forget these rights or any others. </p>

<p>We need zero tolerance for missing on these issues.</p>

<p><b>What’s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
We need it. The real question is: Our people being stuck in traffic, is that good for the economy? Or the people? I&#8217;ll tell you this, if Oahu gets infrastructure we had better get some too. Efficiency in government and for our citizens sitting in traffic. </p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for HB 444?</b><br />
Yes and Yes. There is no need to mix religious views with these issues. Look at it from a business perspective. Of course we should have equality in partnerships in the eyes of the government. Benefits should not be withheld between a mother and daughter or any other combination of partnership in order to use government benefits. Marriage, however is a religious institution. And that&#8217;s an agreement between the two individuals and their religion and/or God. Government has no jurisdiction over your church, temple, or mosque given that others&#8217; rights are not harmed.</p>

<p><b>Do you support the Akaka Bill?</b><br />
Yes.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
Well we could let our government continue to whittle away at our freedom until the people revolt from oppression.</p>

<p>Or we could allow corporations to profiteer at the demise of the common man and wait till we reach that tipping point where too many people have lost their house and we can&#8217;t eat fish without being poisoned and our crops have been poisoned and genetically altered to the point we are all eating amino acids that taste just like Tasty Wheat.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Or we could all unplug for a minute and drive to the election booth and cast our vote. And hopefully you haven’t been too indoctrinated with corporate or, even worse, movie culture and you’ll vote for Michael W Hale.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii’s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times? How do we solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem?</b><br />
I’m an advocate for small business as seen in <a href="http://michaelwhale.wordpress.com/" title="my resume page">my resume page</a>. I have spoken with many business owners and many feel that doing business in Hawaii is not made easy by our government. In fact it’s one of the worst in the nation. Small businesses drive our economy especially on the &#8220;Big Island.&#8221; We need to nurture and encourage those who are willing to take that risk. We need to devise ways and instruction to help reduce those risks.</p>

<p>Many of our most educated friends and neighbors are lost to higher paying jobs on the &#8220;mainland.&#8221; This must be slowed with a friendlier, new business attitude that includes internships. Our location and natural resources keep us poised to give our children a great lifestyle here on the island.</p>

<p>I propose we offer free business classes held by the Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) and community colleges for college credit. Some of those classes should be the following:</p>

<p>Business start up course<br />
Business promotion coarse<br />
Marketing vs. Advertising<br />
Online business courses<br />
Growing your business<br />
Business burn out avoidance<br />
Financial statements coarse<br />
Business plan coarse<br />
Dealing with regulations<br />
Taxes<br />
Farming organic<br />
Farming for profits<br />
Aquaculture<br />
Permaculture<br />
Sustainable farming<br />
Sustainable renewable energy<br />
Many computer classes</p>

<p>These classes should be results driven that help the business to succeed. Each assignment will bring the business to a more solid level and have actual real world application and merit. In a sense, it will be a business incubation class. These classes are meant to stimulate the local economy and job market. Ideally the classes should be free and open to anyone who wants to start or grow a business and get college credit for it.</p>

<p>How to pay for it: pell grants and unemployment first to work programs. Reduce costs of the class by putting the curriculum online and having previous graduates of the class as in class tutors.</p>

<p>Economic small business stimulus: Taxes discounts should be given to businesses that cater to off-island money being brought on-island.</p>

<p>Hawaii brands: Hawaii brands should have protection from misuse of  “Made in Hawaii” and other important trademarks that are integral to Hawaiian brand success. </p>

<p>Labor and safety: Our workers should be able to unionize and, even better, co-op and be able to form other employee-owned organizations. And they must not be penalized for doing so.</p>

<p>Stronger business formations and structures: Businesses should be encouraged to include employees or other stakeholders as stockholders thus giving power to the employees and creating a dynamic unstoppable business entity owned by a team of vested workers. When hard times come again, they can decide as a group how to stay afloat. In all likelihood this type of company would flourish because it is more nimble.</p>

<p><b>How do you feel about medical marijuana?</b><br />
The cannabis issue is not one issue. But I’ll be brave and address some of it briefly. I believe we have more important issues like helping small businesses, the economy, and the environment.</p>

<p>Medical use: This is a no brainer. If a doctor prescribes it then government has no say other than safety (especially regarding children and driving). If we can protect our children, drivers, and other citizens from all the consequences of legalization, then I&#8217;m all for that personal freedom. Then I’m also in favor of an educational program to inform people, users, and youth of the effects of drugs on the brain&#8212;including the tendency to become addicted to the endorphins released and the decrease of endorphins released from daily living activities when using, causing normal activities to seem boring, and the long term effects on a growing brain. (I understand this is some not all.)</p>

<p>Yes on freedom. Yes on education. Yes on protecting our children. Yes on volunteer programs for the addicted.</p>

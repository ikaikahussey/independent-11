<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Improv comedy in Hawaii is enjoying a surge with the success of the Laughtrack Theater, On the Spot, and the Improvaganza comedy festival. The newest attraction in Honolulu’s improv scene is Mikomiko Second Fridays at Fresh Café. </p>

<p>Mikomiko Improv performs improvisational comedy the second Friday of every month at <a href="http://www.freshcafehi.com" title="Fresh Café">Fresh Café</a>, 831 Queen St. Mikomiko does both short form improv, with games similar to the hit TV Show <i>Whose Line is it Anyway,</i> as well as long form improv, which are original, improvised plays.</p>

<p>Although Mikomiko is Honolulu’s newest improvisational theatre group, its members have, combined, over 75 years of theatre, film, and improv experience, including involvement with other local improv groups such as In Yo Face Improv, On The Spot, and Loose Screws. Mikomoto&#8217;s players have worked with Diamond Head Theatre, Kumu Kahua Theatre, the Hawaii Shakespeare Festival, Honolulu Theatre for Youth, and Laughtrack Theater Company and have dedicated themselves to two things: theatre and making people laugh.</p>

<p>Mikomiko is: Meredith Desha Enos, Walter Eccles, Christopher Obenchain, Kehau Rezentes, Chris Riel, and Shawn Thomsen. Mikomiko is Hawaiian to describe something that is perfectly marinated, savory, and slightly salty. It also has the connotation of something that is entertaining and educational.</p>

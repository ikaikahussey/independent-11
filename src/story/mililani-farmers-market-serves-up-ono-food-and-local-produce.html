<p>MILILAN&#8212;Plate lunches, fresh sunflowers, and locally made healthy treats like flax seed cookies were up for sale at the <a href="http://www.hfbf.org/farmersMarketMililani.shtml" title="Mililani Farmers Market">Mililani Farmers Market</a>. The market, which one Mililani resident calls &#8220;smallish but very busy,&#8221; brings Mililani residents together every Sunday, from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at the Mililani High School (MHS). </p>

<p>The market, which had about 15 booths set up, was buzzing with shoppers toting reusable shopping bags and loading them up with fresh baked bread and vegetables. The Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation and Mililani High School have come together to cosponsor the market that is held in the parking lot by the MHS gym. </p>

<p>&#8220;This market is a step in the right direction. It&#8217;s an important thing to be teaching our children, it&#8217;s at a perfect location, a high school, so that our children are aware of the importance of supporting local businesses,&#8221; explained a Mililani High mom. </p>

<p>A vegetable vendor without many veggies left by the time I got there explained that she sells out of most of her veggies each Sunday. &#8220;There is a lot of people who choose to shop for their produce once a week at farmers markets,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a lot of customers at all the markets I set up a booth at tell me they don&#8217;t shop in the supermarket for vegetables anymore.&#8221; </p>

<p>Island wide there is indeed a growing trend to support local businesses and buy products at their freshest. And it&#8217;s not just vegetables, the Mililani market has fresh local dairy products from the Naked Cow Dairy, fresh flowers and potted herbs and other plants, local honey products, snacks, and local condiments. </p>

<p>&#8220;I like how it&#8217;s sort of ironic that the market is placed directly across from Wal Mart and big time supermarkets,&#8221; said Ann, a new Mililani resident, adding, &#8220;[The market&#8217;s] the exact opposite of them. It&#8217;s locals supporting local businesses and getting the freshest food possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some market goers come to socialize and browse, picking up whatever looks appealing that day. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fun thing to do on a Sunday, a nice way to end the weekend. I go and see some neighbors, my daughter sees friends from school and we buy some snacks to take home,&#8221; said May who has been going to the market for two years.</p>

<p>Other people go with a grocery list in mind. &#8220;I go to get the BaLe breads. They are very well made and much cheaper than in a store. I also pick up all my vegetables on Sunday,&#8221; said Jin, a longtime Mililani resident who walks to the market every Sunday with her granddaughter.</p>

<p>The Mililani Market is still growing, and although the market may not boast the largest amount of tents at each time, the list of vendors who alternate Sundays between other markets is long. &#8220;It&#8217;s a nice surprise. You don&#8217;t know exactly what you will get on a Sunday, but its always a good variety,&#8221; said Jin, adding, &#8220;But we do always know the staples will be there, like vegetables and fruit.&#8221;</p>

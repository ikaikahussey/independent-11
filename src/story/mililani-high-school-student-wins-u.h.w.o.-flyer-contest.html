<p>MILILANI&#8212;Mililani High School senior Sabrina Lowe was thrilled during a surprise visit from the University of Hawaii when as they shared the news with her that she was the grand prize winner in the UH West Oahu Flyer Contest. Lowe had a big smile as she learned that her design would be featured in April issues of <i>MidWeek</i> and the <i>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</i>.</p>

<p>Participants in the flyer contest were asked to submit a flyer that portrays UH West Oahu as a &#8220;top choice for college-bound students,&#8221; according to a university spokesperson.</p>

<p>Lowe was chosen as the grand prize winner out of over 250 entrants from throughout the state and received a brand new Amazon Kindle, a wireless reading device. &#8220;Sabrina&#8217;s flyer is a first-rate example of creativity and a concise message,&#8221; said Gene I. Awakuni, UH West Oahu&#8217;s chancellor. &#8220;With more than 250 entries in this year&#8217;s contest, the judging was difficult as so many of the students were able to convey the importance of higher education at UH West Oahu.&#8221; </p>

<p>Each student who entered the contest had a chance to win an iPod Nano, something each finalist received, an Amazon Kindle, and the chance to get their work published. The public was able to vote online for the grand-prize winning design.</p>

<p>As she heard the news that she won Lowe said, &#8220;I looked at the past winners of this contest and tried to focus on what works and what will appeal to students today.&#8221; Adding, &#8220;I am so excited. I really didn&#8217;t know what to say. I really wanted to win, and I really can&#8217;t believe that I actually did it.&#8221;</p>

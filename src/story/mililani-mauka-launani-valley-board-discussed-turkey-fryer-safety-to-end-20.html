<p>The Mililani Mauka / Launani Valley Neighborhood Board No. 35 met for their monthly meeting on November 16, 2010. It was the board&#8217;s last meeting for 2010, before a meeting for December &#8216;10. </p>

<p>The board addressed City monthly reports and reports from elected officials. </p>

<p>Unlike most meetings, there was no &#8220;board business&#8221; or resident/community concerns. </p>

<p>The board did discuss the number of turkey fryers on sale at the Mililani Wal Mart, which caused the meeting to cover safety tips for using the fryers. The Mililani High School turf project was also discussed, with the project reported to begin in spring of 2012.</p>

<p>Furloughs – It is up to the new administration whether furloughs continue until the end of the fiscal year; furloughs were negotiated with the unions.</p>

<p>Hearing no objection, the agenda was taken out of order to Monthly Reports, Honolulu Fire Department.</p>

<p>Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) – Capt. Carvalho reported the following:</p>

<p>October 2010 Statistics – Fires included 1 structure (Ewa Beach area while relocated), 9 wildland (one in Waianae area while relocated), and 3 rubbish; emergencies included 29 medical, 1 search/rescue (Mililani Cemetery), 9 miscellaneous calls; and 1 major incident involving 4 companies + 1 Battalion Chief (person pinned in Mililani Cemetery).</p>

<p>Fire Safety Tip – A) Consider a fire-resistant artificial Christmas tree. If purchasing a real tree, choose one as fresh as possible, keep it hydrated, and away from heat sources. Use non-combustible materials for decorations and do not overload extension cords. B) When cooking if you must leave the stove even for a few minutes, turn it off. Unattended cooking is the number one cause of home fires. Keep children away from cooking areas. C) The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) discourages the use of outdoor gas-fueled turkey fryers. Further information can be found on www.nfpa.org. D) Share your home escape plan and the designated meeting place outside the home with visiting guests.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns:</p>

<p>Station Relocation – Relocation refers to a fire station crew covering another area, such as Ewa Beach when that company is out on an alarm longer than 30 minutes. However, the Mililani Fire Crews usually relocate to the Waialua area. Since Mililani has two fire stations, the area is always covered.</p>

<p>Turkey Fryers – A) It was noted that Wal-Mart has a lot of turkey fryers for sale and HFD should inform the store of turkey fryers fire hazards. B) The proper way to use a turkey fryer is to place the turkey in the pot, fill the pot with water to cover the turkey (not over flowing), which should the level at to add the oil. Most people put too much oil, which overflows causing a fire.</p>

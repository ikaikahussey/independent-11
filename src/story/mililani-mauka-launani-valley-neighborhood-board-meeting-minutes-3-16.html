Scald burns are the most common injury among children ages four and younger. When boiling eggs for a coloring activity, be attentive to your cooking and children. Do not leave any cooking unattended.<br />
If candles are used, do not leave them unattended or near drapes or other ignitable materials, such as artificial grass, which is commonly used as filler for children&#8217;s baskets. Ensure the candle holder is the proper size for the type of candle being used.<br />
Familiarize yourself with the contents of your children&#8217;s baskets, especially if they contain small toys, and be aware of the manufacturer&#8217;s warning for choking hazards for young children.<br />

<p>Mayor Mufi Hannemann&#8217;s Representative&#8212;Collins Lam gave the following report:</p>

<p>Capital Improvement Project (CIP) Budget&#8212;The CIP budget is being worked on this week.<br />
Traffic Operations at Meheula Parkway and Makaikai Street&#8212;The island-wide Traffic Signal Optimization Project recently completed optimization of traffic signal operations in Mililani Mauka. The traffic signal operations were optimized for several time periods during the day including AM peak, midday off peak, PM peak period, and evening off peak; timing routines were set for weekend operations. The Meheula Parkway corridor in the vicinity of the H-2 Interchange faces challenges because of the high concentration of traffic, especially during the AM and PM peak periods. During these times the area is at saturation, and although optimization increases the efficiency of the operations, the sheer volume of traffic still results in significant traffic queues. The optimization should demonstrate more visible improvements during off-peak times. Increase efficiencies during these time periods should result in less delay to drivers in the area. The optimization project is currently going through a refinement phase where the traffic signal timing programs are tweaked to provide maximum benefit for the community. This process would benefit greatly from any feedback the community can provide.<br />
Community Park Fencing Start Date&#8212;The City Department of Design and Construction will advertise the project on April 13, 2010, with bids opening on May 13, 2010.<br />
Illegally Parked Cars on Aelike Street between Makaikai and Kahele Streets&#8212;Lt. Eric Brown spoke with that area sector sergeant to make checks and take the necessary enforcement action. Due to a previous similar complaint, several citations were issued to low rider type vehicles.</p>

<p>No questions for Mayor Hannemann representative.</p>

<p>Board of Water Supply (BWS)&#8212;Erwin Kawata reported the following:</p>

<p>Water Main Breaks&#8212;No water main breaks reported for the month of February 2010.<br />
Water Main Breaks Information&#8212;Water main breaks are an unfortunate and unavoidable factor in the water utility industry. No water utility is free of main breaks. The BWS works diligently to reduce the amount of breaks that happen every year having more than 2,000 miles of pipeline across the island of Oahu. Aging infrastructure is one of the greatest challenges facing utilities across the nation and world. While our own water infrastructure may not be as old, severely corrosive marine environments significantly impact the underground infrastructure and shorten the service life to the pipeline assets. Proactive steps being taken by BWS towards reducing the amount of breaks are as part of the Quality infrastructure Conservation Initiative (QUINCI), field crews gather data at the main repair site to determine why different pipelines fail. Collected data can be used to develop solutions that can later be incorporated in pipeline design, installation and/or maintenance. The Board also has a team dedicated to detecting leaks within the water system. When leaks are detected, a crew can execute a planned repair job on the main by fixing the leak before it turns into an emergency main break. In an attempt to extend the life of the waterlines corrosion control methods are being worked on.<br />
In an ongoing effort to provide a safe and dependable water supply, BWS carefully manages and plans for the renewal and replacement of its infrastructure.<br />

House Bill 2169  Lowers the average unemployment insurance tax for the next two years. A bill signed into law last week by the Governor becomes effective immediately.

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Budget and House Lay-offs Recommendations  Some positions were not funded while others were replaced. Per the Governor, all departments have cuts. The Department of Agricultures cuts were too severe, thus replacement of a few positions. The House is yet to receive the Senates budget.<br />
Mahalo  Rep. Lee was thanked for supporting the Mililani High Schools new turf request. Rep. Lee explained that the project was not approved. The high school is generously providing their facilities to all schools. The $939,000 will lapse because the project was not approved and started this year. However, the Board of Education (BOE) chooses the projects and lists them on a priority list. Community input is valuable.</p>

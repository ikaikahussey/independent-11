<p>Board of Water Supply (BWS)&#8212;Erwin Kawata reported the following:</p>

<p>Water Main Breaks&#8212;No water main breaks reported for the month of March 2010.<br />
Water System Improvement Projects: Which Mains to Replace and When?&#8212;A) Most Oahu communities were first established centuries ago. As these communities age, major portions of the infrastructure like roads, sewers and water mains are also aging and nearing the end of their useful life spans. The BWS system includes nearly 2,000 miles of pipeline, with more than 40% between 30 and 60 years old. In an ongoing effort to provide a safe and reliable water supply, BWS carefully manages and plans for the renewal and replacement of its infrastructure. B) BWS continually analyzes the water system to prioritize which mains need to be replaced. The four primary factors taken in to account are: a) Condition Assessment-Utilizing maintenance and main break records for historical data and analyzing the factors that affect pipe longevity, like soil type and pipe material, in a predictive analysis, engineers determining which pipe segments have the highest probability of near future failure. b) System Improvements&#8212;BWS identifies areas where the performance of the water system can be improved by adjusting water pressures, increasing main size, or by installing additional fire hydrants. c) Public Impact&#8212;Higher priority is given to mains along major traffic routes where main breaks will have significant impacts on traffic. Mains serving facilities that provide essential services, such as hospitals, or that serve large numbers of customers are given a higher priority. d) Project Coordination&#8212;if there is a possibility to mitigate the impact on residents or motorists by combining projects with other City or State agencies, those projects are also given higher priority. C) Recognizing the impact construction projects can have on a community, these projects are critical to reducing the number of emergency repairs and to ensure a continued safe and dependable water supply. To find out if there is a BWS construction project in your area, log on to www.boardofwatersupply.com, pull down the &#8220;Community&#8221; tab, and click on &#8220;Construction Projects.&#8221; Maps relative to construction projects is posted by neighborhood board districts.

As previously stated, tents are not being prohibited from parks, but will still be allowed to be put up by permit from the City Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR). However, shopping carts are completely banned from the city parks.<br />

<p>BOARD BUSINESS:</p>

<p>Board/Department of Education Discussion on Development of Capital Improvement Project (CIP) Matrix and Mililani High School Field Turf Project&#8212;Eileen Clarke, Board of Education (BOE) representative, reported that due to many requests received for funding projects, the Department of Education (DOE) provides a Capital Improvement Project (CIP) list called the matrix list. The BOE prioritizes the requests according to most need and importance. BOE concerns are equal services for all students. This year&#8217;s BOE decision did no include the Mililani High School field. Priorities are based on the best interests of the students. The Ways and Means Committee mandated that another $80 million be cut from the DOE budget. Unless the funding is released by the legislative Budget and Finance Committee it is not seen by the BOE/DOE. Everyone was encouraged to attend the BOE meeting and give testimony. The agenda is noticed seven day prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Fundraising for Schools by Parents/Communities&#8212;Schools may take donations at anytime. However, fundraisers, etc. must go through the procurement process; there are concerns about raising funds for the schools.<br />
The Priority List&#8212;What can the community do to have the request for the field repairs move up on the priority list? Who prepares the board report for the BOE? Chair Hazama asked for Clarke&#8217;s assistance in helping to move the Mililani High School field repair request up on the priority list.<br />
Community Concerns: A) The Mililani High School stadium is used year round by both public and private schools, is in dire need of repairs, and is a health and safety issue. Volunteers have done their best trying to get the turf ready for soccer season by roping off areas of the field. The Schools&#8217; Community Council currently has raised enough money to purchase products for the field. B) Students are safe in the classrooms, but daily injuries occur at practice on the field. The condition of the field is out of the control for the entire community. C) Double hitter games are shown on Oceanic 16 on the weekends and the field takes a beating. D) It was suggested to have the sports teams practice elsewhere. E)&nbsp; Soccer players are not protected when exposed to the elements and games have been cancelled due to the condition of the field when the weather is bad. F) It hopeful that information provided to Clarke would be taken back to the BOE and that she would speak in favor of this request. G) The request for synthetic field, etc. would just be enhancing what is already there. H) Follow up will be done as where this request is on the matrix list. I) Several years ago, the House and Senate appropriated $950,000 for this project and should be a priority at this time. It takes the efforts and involvement of the DOE and the governor to release the funding; and if included in the legislative budget to work closely with the governor.</p>

<p>Chair Hazama thanked everyone for attending tonight&#8217;s meeting and expressing their views on this important issue. Clarke was asked to inform the Board of the next BOE meeting. Clarke committed to Dr. Brummel (Mililani High School Principal) to speak with Mr. Moore and Mr. Toguchi member of the BOE.</p>

<p>Oishi moved that the Mililani Mauka/Launani Valley Neighborhood Board No. 35 strongly requests that (1) BOE/DOE raise the priority level of the Project and (2) OFB releases the funds to allow the Project to incur for the installation of synthetic turf, field repair and sports stadium improvements projects at Mililani High School.</p>

<p>MILILANI&#8212;The 20th anniversary of <a href="http://www.handsonnetwork.org/nationalprograms/signatureevents/MakeADifferenceDay" title="Make A Difference Day">Make A Difference Day</a> saw millions of volunteers around the world serving their neighbors through food drives, green space expansions, and community building renovations among many other projects. In Mililani Town, volunteers made their difference with paint brushes, rollers, and some elbow grease.</p>

<p>Approximately 350 volunteers came together on Saturday, October 23 to paint over graffiti in celebration of national Make a Difference Day. From 7:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. community members visited six City parks that had been identified as needing the most help in covering up unsightly graffiti. Volunteers painted over new graffiti as well as covered up paint &#8220;blotches&#8221; that served as a previous quick fix to cover up old graffiti. </p>

<p>Volunteers also worked on walls along Kamehameha Hwy and along Meheula Pkwy between Kuahelani Avenue and Lanikuhana Avenue. Paint supplies were purchased by the Mililani Town Association and donations were received from various merchants and local politicians. Volunteers worked on Holanialii Neighborhood Park, Kamaio Neighborhood Park, Noholoa Neighborhood Park, Mililani Neighborhood Park, Mililani Waena Neighborhood Park, and Town Center Park. </p>

<p>Created by <i>USA Weekend Magazine</i>, Make A Difference Day is an annual event that takes place on the fourth Saturday of every October. An estimated three million people chose to volunteer on National Make a Difference day, and accomplished thousands of projects in hundreds of towns. </p>

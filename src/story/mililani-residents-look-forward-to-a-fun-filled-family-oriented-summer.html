<p>MILILANI&#8212;A community with seven recreation centers created to facilitate communal and private family events, Mililani was originally planned to be a family oriented, close knit community. And this summer, there a number of creative family-oriented events to look forward to. </p>

<p>The Mililani Town Association (MTA) has organized a community movie night in hopes of bringing families together on Friday, June 25. In a summer twist on the drive-in experience, <I>Monsters and Aliens</I> will be shown as families float around on inner tubes, noodles, or pool loungers at Mililani Town Center&#8217;s Recreation Center 3, 95-281 Kaloapau St.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good thing to give people an opportunity to join other families and get out right in their own community,&#8221; said a Mililani mom while shopping in Wal Mart. She added, &#8220;It&#8217;s a safe approach, people don&#8217;t have to drive far, or at all for that matter and it&#8217;s much more affordable than taking the whole family out to the movie theater.&#8221;</p>

<p>MTA provides the fun floaties (outside pool toys are not permitted at the family night). Movie goers can bring blankets, mats, and chairs and the MTA will provide popcorn, mochi crunch, and drinks. Admission ranges from $2 to $6. Presale tickets can be bought at the MTA administrative office, 95-303 Kaloapau St., or at Recreation Center 3.</p>

<p>Family bingo night, an MTA organized night that has been popular in the past, is being revived on Friday, July 9. MTA has all new prizes and refreshments to keep the excitement going this year. Family bingo will take place at recreation center 7 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The town association has asked attending families to call the administration office at (808) 623-7300 to reserve their spots, which go on a first come, first serve basis. When reserving a spot callers, need to have their MTA ID card number available and the cards will also be checked at the door of the event. </p>

<p>Each month, the Mililani Town Center also hosts a wide range of free community activities ranging from clown shows, to chess and checker games, hula and musical performances, and crafts.</p>

<p>In 1986 Mililani Town was awarded the title of an All-America City. The award is given by the National Civic League annually to ten cities in the United States and recognizes communities whose citizens work together to identify and tackle community-wide challenges and achieve uncommon results. Mililani is currently the only community in Hawaii to ever receive the award. </p>

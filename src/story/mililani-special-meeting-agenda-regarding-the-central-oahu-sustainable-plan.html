Overdevelopment in Central Oahu: What Can Be Done About It?</p>

<p>Mililani/Waipio/Melemanu Neighborhood Board 25 and the Oahu Chapter of the Sierra Club are co-sponsoring this forum on Central Oahu development.<br />
 <br />
Did you know that the City &amp; County of Honolulu Central Oahu Sustainable Communities Plan adopted in 2002 could result in an additional 22,000 housing units yet to be built&#8212;or some 55,000 plus residents&#8212;in Central Oahu by the year 2025? Castle and Cooke Homes, Inc. has a proposal now before the State Land Use Commission to develop 5,000 homes on some of the best agricultural land left on Oahu at Koa Ridge, adding potentially 15,000 new residents to the area. <br />
 <br />
* Do you feel that further development in Central Oahu will result in more traffic, increased commuter times, overcrowded schools, more urban sprawl, and the loss of needed prime agricultural lands?<br />
 <br />
* Do you feel your future livability and quality of life will be jeopardized by the lack of adequate infrastructure such as schools and roads as the housing development increases?<br />
 <br />
* Can the public school system provide a quality education to this many new children? <br />
 <br />
* How much more development do you think should be allowed in Central Oahu? And, if so, under what conditions?<br />
 <br />
* What solutions/results would you like to see as the development increases?&nbsp;  &nbsp;   <br />

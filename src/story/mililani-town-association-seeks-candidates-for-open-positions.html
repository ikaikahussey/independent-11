<p>MILILANI&#8212;Mililani Town is a tight knit community known for its well maintained common areas and communal efforts to keep the town safe and family friendly. Mililani homeowners work together under the Mililani Town Association (MTA), which is looking for candidates to fill the three vacancies on the board of directors.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old town association says they are looking for candidates who are dedicated to serving the interests of MTA, and have time to attend the association’s monthly board meetings and serve as a member of the MTA standing committees. With nine directors on the board, three open director positions that each last for a three-year term, open up every year. Calvin Maeda, MTA general manager, says the positions are open to Mililani homeowners only.</p>

<p>“The board directors help manage operations of MTA,&#8221; explained Maeda on Friday. &#8220;They oversee usage of our common areas, work with developers, total operations. </p>

<p>Maeda said the association hasn’t received any applications yet, but they are hoping for them to start coming in “in about a month.”</p>

<p>Although the application deadline is December 22 at 10:00 a.m., the election results won’t be announced until the 43rd Annual Board Meeting on March 16, 2011. </p>

<p>“The election is all done by Mililani homeowners. They elect their directors,” Maeda said.</p>

<p>According to the association, current non-profit organization law does not permit spouses to serve on the same board at the same time, for a non-profit organization. “We’ve run into this before, spouses both wanting to be on the board, but we advised them that they cannot,” Maeda said.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.mililanitown.org:82/" title="MTA website">MTA website</a>, the association provides financially stable management with concern for maintaining property values and for the purpose of protecting the peace, health, comfort, safety, and general welfare of the owners of Mililani Town. The association also provides recreational activities at their seven recreational centers, six of which have swimming pools. A planned community of parks and walkways, schools, churches, and support organizations, Mililani has a distinct emphasis on family living.</p>

<p><i>Board of Directors candidate information profile forms are available at the MTA ddministrative offices located at 95-303 Kaloapau Street, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Candidates should include a photograph (passport size) with their application, which can also be downloaded at the <a href="http://www.mililanitown.org:82/" title="MTA website">MTA website</a>.</i></p>

<p>Alternatives to replace the high cost of oil because it has to be shipped in. Hawaii imports 50,000,000 gallons of oil.<br />
HCEI goals by 2030 of using 30% efficiency and 40% sun wind and other renewable energy.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed: Community Opposition – This proposed project took a long time because of community opposition.</p>

<p>Hawaiian Patriot Oil Tanker Spill – In 1977 this catastrophe affected 350 miles west of Honolulu.<br />
Renewable Energy for all Energy by 2030 – Federal, state, county and Hawaiian Electric Company momentum plan is to harness abundant natural resources.<br />
Sun Energy Solar Farm – This sun energy solar farm started service in December of 2008 is located on the island of Lanai with 10 acres of panels; and has a purchase power agreement.<br />
Mililani Renewable Energy Solar Park – Due to the increase in oil prices, an energy solar park is in the conceptual stage to utilize four lots at the top of Meheula Parkway. Existing in that area are two agricultural farms and sub farms. Some of the farmers will be relocated. The property would be diversified with farming on one side and solar on the other.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Cable Project from Lanai to Oahu – There is a 200 mega watt wind farm on Lanai and work is still being done on the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) cable to connect Lanai, Molokai, and Oahu. Cost would be approximately $800 million to $1 billion, but saving $200 million in the process; this is a benefit to buying alternative energy.</p>

<p>- Timetable – Procurement is April 2010, cable laying 2013, completion 2014, and service 2015.<br />
- Fund Source – The cable system developer will finance up front, and the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) managing the consumer’s monthly payments.<br />
- Cable Transfer to Homes – When the power is sold to HECO and the 20 mega watt energy will be transferred by an inverter station to the converter to the homes.

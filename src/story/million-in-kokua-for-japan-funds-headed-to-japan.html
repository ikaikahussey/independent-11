<p>The recent &#8220;Kokua For Japan&#8221; concert in Hawaii raised $1.6 million, and other donations have poured in locally. But Japanese officials have said the country doesn&#8217;t need aid. <a href="http://www.kitv.com/news/27591955/detail.html" target="_blank">KITV4 News reports</a>.</p>

<p>CNN quoted a Japanese official as saying Japan does not need money from other countries to rebuild. In the immediate aftermath of the quake, truckloads of donated food, clothes and household goods were sent in. Now there are huge pallets of toilet paper, plates and other scattered goods from people who were well-meaning, but unclear on what was needed. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/04/18/japan.quake.volunteers/" target="_blank">CNN reports</a>.</p>

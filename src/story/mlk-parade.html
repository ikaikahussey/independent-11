<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;On Monday, January 17, at 9:00 a.m., the 23rd Annual Martin Luther King Junior Parade will travel down Kalakaua Avenue from Magic Island, culminating in a post-parade Unity Rally at Kapiolani Park. After the parade, the bandstand comes alive with stellar music and entertainment. The all-day festivities also include local and ethnic foods for purchase, a childrenâ€™s playground, community booths, and other vendors.</p>

<p>In 2010, over 50 units and approximately 1000 people marched or rode in the parade, while many thousands watched from the sidewalks and buildings in Waikiki.</p>

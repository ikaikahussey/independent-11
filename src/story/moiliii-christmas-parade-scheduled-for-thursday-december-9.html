<p>Get the keiki and head over to the Moiliili Christmas Parade on Thursday, December 9 from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., when the Kapa-Moi Lions Club and Santa pass out candy throughout Moiliili. </p>

<p>The parade starts at Prince Kuhio Elementary, heads down S. Beretania, turns onto Isenberg, and ends at Stadium Park. Groups are welcome to join in and share their pride along with the Citizen Patrol, church groups, Pride in Moiliili street cleaners, the Jaycees and more.</p>

<p>The Kapakahi Moiliili Kazoo Marching Band will also be making it&#8217;s first appearance. If you&#8217;ve been looking for a chance to show off your own kazoo skills, now is the time. Show up at Prince Kuhio Elementary at 5:00 p.m. for practice and a kazoo. Your most outrageous outfit is your uniform as the band marches behind the Pride in Moiliili banner.</p>

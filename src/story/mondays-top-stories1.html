<p>It was a historic week in Hawaii. Governor Neil Abercrombie called a special session of the Hawaii State Legislature to review SB1, a bill that would make Hawaii the 15th state to allow same sex marriage. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/03/hawaii-special-session-photos_n_4209427.html?utm_hp_ref=hawaii&amp;ir=Hawaii&amp;utm_hp_ref=hawaii">HuffPost Hawaii.</a></p>

<p>After early speculation that the Legislature&#8217;s special session to legalize same-sex marriage could be wrapped up in as few as five days, democracy is proving to be not so tidy — and that&#8217;s a good thing. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131103__Session_on_gay_marriage_spurs_people_to_get_involved.html">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>The fact that both the state and Matson had known about a leaking molasses pipeline for more than a year would quickly become a public embarrassment for the DOT. It turned out the state knew the leak had never been fixed shortly after the spill was reported, but lied to the media and lawmakers about it. DOT officials later said they misled the public because they weren&#8217;t sure what they were legally allowed to say. Still, the misstep has worked to undermine the credibility of the very state agency that is supposed to oversee shipping. <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/11/04/20315-hawaii-dot-never-got-around-to-telling-matson-its-pipe-was-still-leaking/">Civil Beat.</a></p>

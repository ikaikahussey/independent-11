Monday night from about 8:30 p.m., a group of about 75 people assembled at the Mauna Kea Observatories Visitor Center on Hawaii Island to view the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122104467.html" title="total lunar eclipse">total lunar eclipse</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth lines up directly between the sun and the moon, blocking the sunâ€™s rays and casting a shadow on the moon. As the moon moves deeper and deeper into the Earth&#8217;s shadow, the moon changes color before your very eyes, turning from gray to an orange or deep shade of red. </p>

<p>Although the moon was mostly obscured by cloud cover throughout Hawaii, even at the 9,000-foot elevation, its disappearance was still visible, although blurry, through the clouds.</p>

<p>People atop Mauna Kea mingled, sipping hot cocoa and discussing the chill at 9,000 feet. Someone produced a ukulele, and before long, all of the visitors at the center were singing along happily with Christmas carols. One family trucked down a cooler full of snow from the summit, and the children at the visitor center played in it, throwing snowballs and sliding around the parking lot.</p>

<p>With the totality of the eclipse, darkness hampered vision and mobility, so visitors collected in their small groups of family and friends. Although the clouds prevented a clear view of the eclipse, the mood on Mauna Kea was bright.</p>

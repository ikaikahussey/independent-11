<p>MANOA&#8212;The University of Hawaii at Manoa, representatives from the City Department of Transportation Services and State Department of Transportation, and other community members launched a Move with Aloha campaign on Friday, showcasing the very first sharrow lanes installed in the State of Hawaii. Approximately 30 people participated in a short bike ride that highlighted the sharrow lanes and share zones on the UH Manoa campus. </p>

<p>Move with Aloha is comprised of three initiatives to ensure the welfare and safety of the campus community engaged in mixed modes of transportation, to promote a pedestrian-friendly campus, and to support sustainable transport:</p>

<p>1. Sharrow lanes (lanes shared by bicyclists and motorists).</p>

<p>2. Share zones (areas to walk wheels such as bicycles and skateboards during high pedestrian traffic).</p>

<p>3. Bicycle routes (designated to ensure a safe commute to and from campus).</p>

<p>Sharrows are identified as a stencil that consists of carrot top arrows with a bicycle symbol inside. The name &#8220;sharrow&#8221; is a combination of the words &#8220;shared lane&#8221; and &#8220;arrow,&#8221; coined by Oliver Gajda of the City and County of San Francisco Bicycle Program. Sharrows are now included in the Federal Highway Administration’s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which is the national standard for traffic signs and road markings.</p>

<p>UH Manoa also plans to install speed meters at the beginning of each semester to raise awareness and serve as a safety reminder to everyone returning to campus. Additional bicycle routes will gradually be included, as UH Manoa works with the City &amp; County of Honolulu and the State of Hawaii on Oahu’s bike plan.</p>

<p>Move with Aloha is a collaborative effort involving numerous campus groups, including the Chancellor’s Office, Facilities &amp; Grounds, Auxiliary Enterprises, Outreach College, Campus Security, Landscape Advisory Committee, Manoa Bicycling Committee, and Cycle Manoa. </p>

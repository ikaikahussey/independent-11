<p>The governor had a list of three names to work from: U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, Schatz and Department of Land and Natural Resources Deputy Director Esther Kia‘aina.</p>

<p>By selecting Schatz, Abercrombie avoids a special election to fill Hanabusa&#8217;s U.S. House seat. It also declares his independence from Dan Inouye, who had put Abercrombie in an awkward position by publicly stating his preference for Hanabusa prior to his passing.</p>

<p>On Twitter, Politico reporter Manu Raju says that <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/284088837217587200">Inouye&#8217;s office is &#8220;very disappointed&#8221; that the late senator&#8217;s choice of his successor was not honored.</a></p>

<p>And though she didn&#8217;t ascend to the seat, it&#8217;s remarkable that Esther Kia‘aina was recommended as a finalist for the seat. She finished poorly in a November race, but is clearly a favorite among party insiders. That&#8217;s quite an accomplishment.</p>

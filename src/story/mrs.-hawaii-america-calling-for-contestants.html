<p>The 35th annual Mrs. Hawaii America Pageant is seeking Hawaii’s married women as contestants for the coveted 2010 title. The 2010 Mrs. Hawaii America will be crowning a new queen to represent the state on July 23, 2010 at the Neil S. Blaisdell Exhibition Hall, Pikake Room from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.</p>

<p>There are 3 phases of competition: interview, swimwear, and evening gown. Contestants must be 18 years or older and, of course, married. The Mrs. Hawaii organization is looking to provide much needed recognition to Hawaii’s married women to show how extraordinarily beautiful, poised, compassionate, and genuinely real they are. She must be the type of woman who feels the need to continue making a difference in life. These women are more than just homemakers, they are the core to the family unit.</p>

<p>The winner will go on to compete at the national Mrs. America Pageant held this summer in Tuscon, Arizona from August 31st to September 7th. The event, hosted by actress Florence Henderson, showcases 51 women from all the U.S. states and the District of Columbia.</p>

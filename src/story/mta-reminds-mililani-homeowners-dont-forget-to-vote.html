<p>MILILANI&#8212;Mililani Town is a tight knit community known for its well-maintained common areas and communal efforts to keep the town safe and family friendly. Mililani homeowners work together under the Mililani Town Association (MTA), which will soon be holding an election to fill the three vacancies on the board of directors.</p>

<p>The 42-year-old town association said in October that they were looking for candidates who are dedicated to serving the interests of MTA, and have time to attend the association’s monthly board meetings and serve as a member of the MTA standing committees. There are nine directors with three-year terms. Every year, three director positions open for elections. </p>

<p>Calvin Maeda, MTA general manager, says the positions and elections are open to Mililani homeowners only.</p>

<p>“The board directors help manage operations of MTA,” explained Maeda in October. “They oversee usage of our common areas, work with developers, total operations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The candidates for the vacancies include Melvin K. Apana, Robert Barrett, Roger Babcock, Michelle Kidani, Michael S. Mollohan Sr., Jeffrey P. Kim, and Gregory J. Sitar. Although the MTA has been seeking applicants since October, the election results won’t be announced until the 43rd Annual Board Meeting on March 16.</p>

<p>According to the association, current non-profit organization law does not permit spouses to serve on the same board at the same time. “We’ve run into this before, spouses both wanting to be on the board, but we advised them that they cannot,” Maeda said.</p>

<p>According to the MTA website, the association provides financially stable management with concern for maintaining property values and for the purpose of protecting the peace, health, comfort, safety, and general welfare of the owners of Mililani Town. The association also provides recreational activities at their seven recreational centers, six of which have swimming pools. A planned community of parks and walkways, schools, churches, and support organizations, Mililani has a distinct emphasis on family living.</p>

<p>The MTA is asking for homeowners to remember to vote. All votes must be received no later than March 14.</p>

I believe in core principals and moral values like: confidence, strength, motivation, integrity, and accountability to serve as a good director. I have a passion to achieve these goals: 1) Reduce MTA fee by 30 percent 2) Reform Home Improvement Rules 3) Bipartisanship and transparency. I humbly ask for your vote.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;I am the President and co-owner of Coastal Windows, Inc., a family owned and operated vinyl window and door manufacturer in the Waipio-Gentry Business Park, since 1990,&#8221; Barrett said. &#8220;We employ 40 plus people and many of them live in the central Oahu area.

I would like to help the board stay focused and on point with fiscal responsibility. I would be honored to be considered for one of the vacancies on the Mililani Board of Directors.&#8221;</p>

While this service requires participation in many monthly meetings, the dedicated efforts by all MTA Board members ensures the best quality of life for our Mililani community. My participation in Mililani community activities began in 1980 serving as a manager and board member of the Mililani-Waipio Bobby Sox League. I have served on the Mililani High School PTSO and their Student Board of Appeals. As an alumni of the Hawaii Leadership Academy, I have gained valuable leadership skills, and I firmly believe that helping others is a key core value.

<p>Kim said: &#8220;I’m not a Lawyer, but in my &#8216;limited legal interpretation,&#8217; I believe Sections 5.05(a) (Powers and Authority of Association), 5.07 (Liability of Member of the Board), and 5.08 (Exclusive Powers of the Association) of the MTA-DCCRs collectively comprise a &#8216;Writ of Assistance&#8217; or a &#8216;... general search [warrant] that [does] not expire.&#8217; Such writs have been &#8216;postscribed&#8217; since the American Revolution (late 18th century) because &#8216;... [a]ny place could be searched at the whim of the holder, and searchers were not responsible for any damaged they caused[;] [t]his put anyone who had such a writ above the law.&#8217; According to Wikipedia: &#8216;Controversy over these general writs of assistance inspired the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which [forbids] general search Warrants in the United States.&#8217; If you’ve been victimized by the MTA-DCCRs as I have, I invite you to join me in The Crusade Against Facism &amp; Oppressionism at <a href="http://www.cafoomta.com" target="_blank">http://www.cafoomta.com</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;After previously serving as a director and board treasurer of Mililani Town Association for 9 years, the last year away from the board has allowed for a good break and allowed me to observe the board from the outside,&#8221; Sitar said. &#8220;I have a tremendous appreciation for the work that the staff of MTA puts in to maintaining Mililani as a premier community it is, and it would be an honor to return to the board and serve the community of Mililani.</p>

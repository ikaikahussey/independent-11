<p>&#8220;An all Democratic system has served Hawaii badly. Single party government at any level in any state has led to corruption and an inability to address the big problems. Hawaii needs to have a two party government. So my recommendation is either:</p>

<p>1. Elect a majority of Republicans to the legislature and Mufi or Neil to the Governorship.<br />
2. Elect the usual suspects to the legislature and Duke to the Governorship.&#8221;</p>

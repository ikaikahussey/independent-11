<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Honolulu is home to a strong, diverse dance community. You can find performers practicing everything from Balinese to ballet. Duets: Exploring Dance Through Modern, Classical, and Cultural Traditions brings these genres and traditions together in one innovative program.</p>

<p>The program is made up entirely of duets&#8212;pairs of dancers. Each performance is limited to five minutes (with one exception), and there will be three intermissions. In the lineup is Balinese dance, contemporary ballet, haka, hula, classical Japanese, Korean and modern dance.</p>

<p>In addition, the works include a world premiere&#8212;x2 by University of Hawaii Assistant Professor of Dance and Theatre Amy Lynn Schiffner&#8212;and the uniting of two of Hawaii&#8217;s best known modern dancers, Peter Rockford Espiritu and Simeon Den, who is flying in from Los Angeles, where he now lives. The program is made possible by a grant from the Mayor&#8217;s Office on Culture and the Arts.</p>

<p>The program is curated by Denise Nakano, the Academy&#8217;s Associate Director of Development for Special Events and Programs. She is also a lifelong dancer, and has long wanted to produce a dance program for the Doris Duke Theatre. Denise teaches an adult ballet class at Queen Emma Ballet and travels to New York City every year to train with Kat Wildish, who is on staff at The Ailey Extension and Greg Zane (former Hawaii Ballet Theatre principal). She has worked as assistant choreographer, dance captain and/or stage manager on such Diamond Head Theatre productions as Flower Drum Song, Peter Pan, Meet Me in St. Louis, Cinderella, and The Mystery of Edwin Drood.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I love about this program is the diversity of performers and dance styles, which reflects the uniqueness of being in Hawaii,&#8221; says Nakano. &#8220;All the dancers have trained for years to learn a movement style and vocabulary&#8212;some of them centuries old. I am thankful to them and their choreographers and teachers for embracing this program and sharing their love of dance with us.&#8221;</p>

<b>Hula: Kilauea</b><br />
Composer: Alice Namakelua<br />
Choreographer: Maelia Loebenstein-Carter<br />
Premiere: September 28, 1991<br />
Dancers: ?nela Evans, Keahiahi Long</p>

<p><b>Balinese dance: Teruna Jaya</b><br />
Composer: Pan Wandres<br />
Choreographer: I Gede Manik<br />
Dancers: Nezia Azmi, Desiree A. Seguritan</p>

<p>This well-known Balinese music-and-dance piece, by two masters from northern Bali, expresses the tumultuous emotions of adolescence&#8212;from calm and sweet, to angry and confused. Since its creation in the early 20th century, Teruna Jaya has been modified and performed with countless variant styles. In this duet, the dancers have added a spatial relationship and interactive element between the two characters, offering their own dynamic and innovative approach to the choreography.</p>

<p><b>Contemporary ballet: La Calma</b><br />
Composer: Pepe Raphael<br />
Choreographer: Minou Lallemand<br />
Dancers: Kelsea Kalei Auld, Caitlin Nichols</p>

<p><b>Maori haka: Huakina and Tika Tonu</b><br />
Composer: Traditional<br />

<p><b>Modern dance: x2 (world premiere)</b><br />
Choreographer: Amy Lynn Schiffner<br />
Premiere: April 16, 2010<br />

<p><b>Korean dance: Seol Changgo (excerpt)</b><br />
Composer: Traditional Nongak genre<br />
Choreographer: Kim Pyong-sop<br />
Dancers: Mary Jo Freshley (Pai Myung-sa), K. Joomi Lee</p>

<p>This changgo nori, or dance performed to the beat of the hourglass-shaped drum changgo, evolved from nongak, or farmers dance, one of the oldest genres in Korea. Kim Pyong-sop developed this virtuoso piece from what is traditionally a group dance to show off his technical skill of playing a succession of rhythmic patterns. Mary Jo Freshley and K. Joomi Lee will perform an excerpt from the 15-minute piece.</p>

<p><b>Modern dance: Two Solos</b><br />
Composer: Sigur Rs<br />
Choreographer: Simeon Den<br />
Premiere: Los Angeles Dance Workshop, June 2008<br />
Dancers: Simeon Den, Peter Rockford Espiritu</p>

<p>Two Solos is an excerpt from Dance and Aria for Two Truths. It is inspired by contemplations on life and death in regard to quantum mechanics and spirituality (i.e theory that there exists parallel universes, time continuum as non-linear, etc.) and friends who passed from AIDS early on in the epidemic. There is an assumption that time is not linear and actually folds back on it self. The dancers in Two Solos are the same person, choreographically out-of-sync, and physically aging in separate parallel lives.</p>

<p><b>Classical Japanese: Shojiro Renjishi (excerpt)</b><br />
Composer: Kineya Shojiro III<br />
Choreographer: Onoe Kikunojo I<br />
Premiere: 1872<br />
Dancers: Onoe Kikunobukazu, Brandon Kiyoshi Goda</p>

<p>This dance debuted at the famed Murayama-za theater in Tokyo and was performed by Bando Hikosaburo V and Sawamura Tosho II. The theme is based on the Noh play Shakkyo (The Stone Bridge). A Buddhist priest, Jakusho Hoshin, travels to China to climb the sacred mountain Mt. Seiryo to gain enlightenment. As he ascends the mountain, he comes across a natural stone bridge that spans a deep ravine. A young boy tells him that the deity Monju Bosatsu and the Land of Paradise can be found on the other side of the bridge; however, the only way one can cross the bridge is to go through severe religious training. The boy tells the priest that if he is patient, he will see a vision of wonder. In time, two majestic lions appear, a parent in white and a child in red. These beasts, the heavenly messengers for the deity Monju Bosatsu, dance among the blooming peony blossoms along Mt. Seiryo.</p>

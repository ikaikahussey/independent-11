<p>HONOLULU&#8212;As heavy rain fell throughout the state, crews from the Honolulu City and Countyâ€™s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) responded to multiple sanitary sewer overflows overnight.</p>

<p>ENV also responded to a sanitary sewer overflow at its Kaneohe Pre-Treatment Facility last night. Stormwater surcharged a manhole located inside the facility near its influent pump station causing 3,000 gallons of untreated wastewater to make its way out a manhole and directly into Kawa Stream, which eventually leads to Kaneohe Bay.</p>

<p><I>The list of overflows is as follows:</I></p>

<p>* 87-154 Maipalaoa Street (Waianae), over 1,000 gallons; ongoing. Discharge to Maili Stream exiting at Maipalaoa Beach. Cause is wet weather.</p>

<p>* 85-751 Lihue Street (Waianae), 27,700 gallons. Discharge to Kawiwi/Kaupuni streams canal exiting at Pokai Bay. Cause is wet weather.</p>

<p>* 1718 Piikea Street (Foster Village), 3,975 gallons. Discharge to Halawa Stream exiting at Pearl Harbor East Loch. Cause is unconfirmed but not believed to be wet weather related.</p>

<p>ENV notified the State Department of Health and the U.S. Navy. Crews have cleaned, disinfected and deodorized the overflow areas. Warning signs were posted, and water sampling will begin once the rain event ends.</p>

<p>DOWNTOWN&#8212;On Thursday, July 14, <a href="http://kumukahua.org" target="_blank">Kumu Kahua Theatre</a> will hold the &#8220;Scotch, Stogies, and Slippahs&#8221; fundraiser, an event that will feature a whiskey and cigar tasting, and food from <a href="http://gomurphys.com" target="_blank">Murphy’s Bar &amp; Grill</a> and <a href="http://jjdolans.com" target="_blank">J.J. Dolan’s</a>. Don Murphy has long been a supporter of his neighbor Kumu Kahua, donating ice for refreshments during Kumu Kahua shows. People involved with the theater often unwind at Murphy’s following performances, rehearsals and meetings.
</p>

<p>The event will also feature a bagpiper, top-shelf Dewar’s whiskey selections, and a variety of Padron cigars. A raffle of cigar accessories will also be held. </p>

<p>“Kumu Kahua Theatre is important to the community,” says Murphy. “It does great things and it’s important with today’s budgeting cutbacks that we help them so they don’t go away.” </p>

<p>The fact that Murphy’s is an Irish pub is fitting, as Ireland has a uniquely long and storied theater tradition celebrating the country’s love of language and unparalleled gift for storytelling. Kumu Kahua Theater provides that same tradition for the people of Hawaii. The fundraiser is certain to further ensure the theater’s position as Hawaii’s beloved incubator and showcase for local playwrights, actors, and directors.</p>

<p>For most of its 40-year history, Kumu Kahua Theatre has told Hawaii’s story through theater, offering talented local playwrights and actors a crucial venue for their craft, and giving the Hawaii community new perspectives on its island home. Many of its productions have become statewide touchstones, such as the hits <em>Folks You Meet at Longs</em> by Lee Cataluna and <em>Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers</em> by Lois Ann Yamanaka.</p>

<p><i>Tickets can be purchased in advance by calling the Kumu Kahua Theatre box office at (808) 536-4441, Mondays to Fridays, from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., or at <a href="http://www.honoluluboxoffice.com" target="_blank">www.honoluluboxoffice.com</a>. Tickets are also available from Murphy’s Bar &amp; Grill, (808) 531-0422, 2 Merchant St along Nuuanu Avenue.</i></p>

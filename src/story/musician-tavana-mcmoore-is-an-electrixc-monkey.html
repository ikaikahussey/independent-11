<p>HONOLULU&#8212;It’s a late Saturday morning when Tavana McMoore arrives at a Honolulu watering hole for a conversation about the stellar trajectory his career as an independent singer-songwriter has been following. His second solo album <i>Electric Monkey</i> has just been released and the future is bright.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in the daytime,” Tavana laughs, gratefully accepting a glass of water from the waitress. Humbly, he declines an offer of an adult beverage. “I’m good, man,” he says. Considering the fact that he is booked to play a full night as a solo artist for a roomful of friends and strangers later, it seems the kind of restraint that separates a true artist from someone who just shows up for the paycheck.</p>

<p>Inspired and encouraged by success unprecedented for a solo rock guitarist in Honolulu, and particularly by the enthusiasm and support of superstar rocker Eddie Vedder, Tavana made the move to Austin, Texas, late last year. </p>

<p>“The amount of good music in that city is staggering,” he marvels. From an artist with such a profound mastery of his instrument and voice, the statement is particularly salient. “Being there gave me the opportunity to see big time professional acts doing their thing.”</p>

<p>Being there regularly also earned Tavana highly-coveted stage time at the international phenomenon known as the South By Southwest Music Festival. “I just happened to be there,” he shrugs. </p>

<p>That humility also comes through when he discusses the influence that the support of Eddie Vedder has had on his outlook and his career. Tavana’s performance of Israel Kamakawiwoole’s “Hawaii ‘78” with the Pearl Jam frontman at the Hawaii Theater last year is enjoying a limited release on 7-inch vinyl, available to members of Pearl Jam’s “10 Club” fan club. “I’m just so fortunate,” Tavana says.</p>

<p>Back in Hawaii for the release of <i>Electric Monkey</i>, Tavana is keeping himself busy. Playing regularly at O’Toole’s Irish Pub, Kelly O’Neil’s, and a variety of Waikiki live music venues, he’s continuing to write songs and amaze people with his searing guitar attack. Capable of emulating Stevie Ray Vaughan without imitating him and singing with the soul of the reggae greats, he makes new fans every time he performs.</p>

<p>He’s been playing professionally since 2000, but this most recent trip to Austin has been among his most enlightening experiences thus far. “I went to the Stevie Ray statue and just knelt down,” he recalls. “It  made me realize what I can do for my city.”</p>

<p><i>Tavana&#8217;s new album</i> Electric Monkey <i>is available online at <a href="http://www.tavanamusic.com" title="www.tavanamusic.com">www.tavanamusic.com</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Tavana will be playing regular gigs in Hawaii this summer at O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s Irish Pub, 902 Nuuanu Avenue, Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. and Kelley O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s, 311 Lewers Street, on Wednesday nights from 1:30 a.m. to 3:30 a.m.</p>

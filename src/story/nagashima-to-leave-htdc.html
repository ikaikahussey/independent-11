<p>PBN&#8217;s Duane Shimogawa <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2013/06/06/yuka-nagashima-resigns-from-hawaiis.html">reports</a> that Len Higashi has been named by the HTDC board to lead the organization in an acting capacity.</p>

<p>Nagashima led the HTDC for seven years. HTDC was formed by the state legislature in 1983 to assist the development of Hawaii&#8217;s high technology sector, as well as the management of the <a href="http://www.htdc.org/incubation-techcenter-mic.html">Manoa Innovation Center</a>, which currently houses 30 tech companies. According to its <a href="http://bit.ly/HTDCar12">2012 annual report</a>, HTDC administered a $7.6 mil budget in 2012, more than half of which came from federal sources.</p>

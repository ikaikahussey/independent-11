<p>HONOLULU  –&nbsp; The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) is. hosting the Hawaiian Way Fund Benefit Native Arts Auction which features art donated from select Native artists, valued at up to $6,00, now through June.&nbsp; The unique auction hopes to generate more awareness of the importance of preserving Native art and culture and invites buyers of the amazing pieces to place both monetary and non-monetary bids, including goods and services. </p>

<p>“The idea behind the opportunity to not only submit monetary bids, but also non-monetary bids of goods and services, is to create a chance for a greater level of engagement by donors,” said Robin Puanani Danner, CNHA President &amp; CEO.&nbsp; “Absolutely a cash bid is welcomed in honoring the work of these artisans and to promote the mission of the Hawaiian Way Fund, but it would be neat to also work with donors by deploying their goods and services instead.”</p>

<p>Winning bids will be selected by a panel of judges selected by the Hawaiian Way Fund, and winners will be announced at an auction reception at Na Mea Hawaii/Native Books at Ward Warehouse on Friday, June 24, 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. </p>

<p>“We’re interested in seeing what people have to offer, whether its bids for volunteer work hours, goods and services that help Native Hawaiian nonprofit organizations reach greater heights, or goods and services that help families in need,” said Fetia Solomon, Hawaiian Way Fund Coordinator.&nbsp; “For example, maybe a financial institution will bid free banking services for a certain amount of time, or a solar contractor might bid the installation of a solar water heating system, or maybe a consulting firm has marketing campaign work they will trade for – we’re completely open!” </p>

<p>All proceeds from the auction will help continue Hawaiian Way Fund’s focus on supporting practitioners and community based initiatives founded on Hawaiian culture, knowledge, and traditions.&nbsp; Featured works for auction include art from Kahi Ching, Kaui Chun, Solomon Enos, Imaikalani Kalahele, Meleanna Meyer, and Harinani Orme.&nbsp; Pieces range from large size canvas pieces to wood carvings that stimulate emotion and creativity.</p>

<p>“These artisans have shown a generosity by their own hands to support the work of the Hawaiian Way Fund,” Danner remarked.&nbsp; “They are philanthropists in their own right, and we hope that the Hawaiian Way Fund Benefit Native Arts Auction will encourage others to continue the ‘pay it forward’ approach that these incredible artisans have started.”</p>

<p>The auction is in collaboration with Ward Center’s Art Park event on Saturday, June 25.&nbsp; A live viewing is available May 16 to June 20 in the CNHA offices at 1050 Queen Street, Suite 200 in Honolulu, and May 30 to June 30 in Na Mea Hawaii/Native Books.&nbsp; Guests can place bids or make a donation on-site or on-line.&nbsp; For more details, please visit our website for online viewing and to access bid applications at <a href="http://www.hawaiianwayfund.org" target="_blank">www.hawaiianwayfund.org</a> or call (808) 596-8199.</p>

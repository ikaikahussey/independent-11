<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Since 2001, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) has been coordinating the Annual Native Hawaiian Convention as a venue to convene the Native community around community development initiatives.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This year&#8217;s convention marks 10 years and represents one of the largest convenings of Hawaiian leaders across the state each year.</p>

<p>“This convention is all about community energy,” said Lilia Kapuniai, CNHA vice pesident and Organizer. “And sharing that energy across the community development spectrum.”</p>

<p>The three-day Annual Native Hawaiian Convention opens on Tuesday, August 23 and ends Thursday, August 25, with all four of Hawaii’s congressional delegates, the Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Hawaii, officials with the Obama White House Initiative on Pacific Islanders, and leaders of Hawaiian organizations, tribal partners, and business firms are scheduled to be in attendance.</p>

<p>“Every major Hawaiian organization, from educational institutions and schools, to some of the most active civic clubs and homestead associations, to Native Hawaiian legal advocates, and housing providers will be sharing and giving presentations,” Kapuniai said. “Amazing things happen when our community and business leaders get together. It’s always something that moves all of Hawaii forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>CNHA is nonprofit that administers a Policy Center, affordable housing solutions, a community loan fund, and social enterprise business models. It’s more than 150 member organizations consist of cultural and education nonprofits, civic and advocacy organizations, health and housing providers, and business and economic development firms. </p>

<p>“We welcome anyone interested in Hawaiian politics, business, social justice, culture, or just want to peruse the convention marketplace,&#8221; Kapuniai said.</p>

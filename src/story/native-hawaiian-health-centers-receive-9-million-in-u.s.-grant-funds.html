<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded approximately $9 million in grant funding to support Native Hawaiian health centers on Kauai, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Hawaii Island.</p>

<p>These grants represent base funding that keeps vital health care providers operational by enabling them to pay for rent, salaries, various overhead, and medications for qualified patients.</p>

<p>Compared to other ethnic populations across America, Native Hawaiians have the highest death rate levels in the categories of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. These Native Hawaiian health care centers provide primary care and dental care while also offering education and prevention programs.</p>

<p>In addition to these grants, $14 million in FY2011 federal appropriations funding were also secured for Native Hawaiian health care. First established in 1988, the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act authorizes initiatives to promote disease prevention, provide health promotion activities, and increase the number of Native Hawaiians in the health profession.</p>

<p>Four grant funding announcements are being distributed through the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services:</p>

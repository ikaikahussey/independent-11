<p>HONOLULU&#8212;According to the National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, youth in Hawaii are more likely than youth in other states to drink before the age of 13 and to consume alcoholic beverages at school. Many of the same factors that contribute to underage drinking can also contribute to other forms of substance abuse and health risk behaviors.</p>

<p>With that staggering statistic in mind, the City’s Department of Community Services is awarding $942,242 to community-based groups to implement programs in support of the City’s Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant initiative, which aims to prevent underage drinking among Oahu youth ages 12 to 17. </p>

<p>Six Oahu-based groups have been selected for awards based on their experience, capabilities, and proposed activities: Alu Like, Coalition for a Drug Free Hawaii, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Honolulu, Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii, Hawaii Speed and Quickness, and Hina Mauka. The programs will be implemented in different sites across Oahu, from Waianae to Waimanalo and is projected to reach over five thousand young people.</p>

<p>The federally-funded initiative, which is also being implemented in Maui, Kauai, and Hawaii counties, requires that all programs have proven results in other communities. However, adaptations may be made to make the programs more culturally appropriate for Hawaii’s youth. Typically, these programs are taught in schools and community settings and improve youth self-esteem, decision making, and social skills.</p>

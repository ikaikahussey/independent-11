<p>The State Legislative Public Access Room (PAR), a liaison between the public and state elected officials, is hosting a series of &#8220;Your Voice&#8221; workshops at several locations on the neighbor islands to help citizens learn about the legislative process and about how they can get involved. </p>

<p>The presentation provides information on the Legislature and legislative process, and includes tips and tools that citizens can use to effectively communicate with lawmakers. The workshop is designed to be helpful to newcomers and seasoned advocates alike.<br />

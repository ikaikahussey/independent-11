<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu selected Everyone Counts, Inc. to deliver online and telephone voting solutions for the 2011 Neighborhood Board Elections. This year’s election will build upon the success of the 2009 election, which introduced the nation’s first all-digital election.</p>

<p>The City is working with Everyone Counts, Inc. to create and distribute individual passcodes to voters via mail. Voters will be mailed a secure passcode around May 2. The election will open May 2 at 12:00 a.m. and will remain accessible until May 20 at 11:59 p.m. (HST). The digital ballot can be accessed through the Neighborhood Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.honolulu.gov/nco" target="_blank">www.honolulu.gov/nco</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Voters without Internet access have additional options to cast their ballots. There will be two voting sites with online access Mondays through Thursdays during the election from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. </p>

<p>•&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Kapolei Hale Conference Room D, 1000 Ulu’ohi’a Street, Kapolei, HI 96707<br />
•&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Honolulu Hale Courtyard, 530 South King Street, Honolulu, HI 96813</p>

<p>Voters must bring their passcodes with them to the voting site. As an option, voters may elect to vote via telephone, by calling toll-free, 888-907-6717. Using either the online or telephone method, voters will need their passcode and the last four digits of their social security number to vote. The online and telephone channels work together and only allow one vote per eligible voter.</p>

<p>The new digital process looks to offer voters convenient, greater access to ballots. Through the use of military-grade encryption technology, votes are securely cast and counted, the City said. The new method will also save taxpayers and voters more money, according to Lori Steele, Chairman and CEO of Everyone Counts, Inc.</p>

<p>The Neighborhood Commission is hosting an Election Kick-off open to the public on Monday, May 2, at 7:00 p.m. in the Mayor’s Conference Room (# 301) in Honolulu Hale, 530 South King Street. Voters, candidates, and stakeholders who wish to learn more about the election process and participate in the “get out the votes” effort are encouraged to attend.</p>

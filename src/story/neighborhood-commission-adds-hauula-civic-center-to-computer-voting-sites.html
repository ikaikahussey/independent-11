<p>HONOLULU &#8212; The Neighborhood Commission Office has added the Hauula Civic Center to the list of sites where eligible voters may utilize free computers to cast their vote in the 2011 Neighborhood Board elections.&nbsp; Other walk-in sites include: <br />
 <br />
•&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Kapolei Hale, First Floor, Conference Room D, 1000 Ulu’ohi’a Street, Kapolei, HI 96707, Mondays thru Thursdays from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm.<br />

<p>The Department of Community Services has made its Hauula satellite office available for voting and will be manning the site.</p>

<p>Voters will be mailed a secure passcode on or about May 2, 2011.&nbsp; The election period is from May 2 at 12 a.m. to May 20 at 11:59 p.m. (HST).&nbsp;  The digital ballot can be accessed through the Neighborhood Commission’s website at <a href="http://www.honolulu.gov/nco" target="_blank">www.honolulu.gov/nco</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Voters must bring their passcodes with them to the voting site.&nbsp; As an option, voters may elect to vote by telephone by calling toll-free 888-907-6717.&nbsp; Using either the online or telephone method, voters will need their passcode and the last four digits of their Social Security Number to vote.&nbsp; The online and telephone channels work together, and only allow one ballot to be cast per eligible voter.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  </p>

<p>Election results will be released on May 23.&nbsp; The new two-year neighborhood board term begins on July 1, 2011.</p>

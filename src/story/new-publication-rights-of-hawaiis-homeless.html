<p>The ACLU of Hawai‘i Foundation (ACLU) today announced the publication of a “know your rights” guide for houseless individuals impacted by City &amp; County of Honolulu sweeps to enforce the Stored Property Ordinance and the Sidewalk Nuisance Ordinance.</p>

<p>The ACLU <a href="http://tinyurl.com/acluhawaii-homeless">guide</a> details the rights most often affected during a sweep, including the right to retrieve property prior to a sweep, what items must be stored by the City, and how to reclaim property taken by the City. A printed version and several language translations are also planned. The guide also includes information about local shelters, community resources, and the voting rights of the houseless in Hawai‘i.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of the rights outlined in the guide resulted from the U.S. District Court’s order in the <em>Martin v. City and County of Honolulu</em> lawsuit, brought by the ACLU and the law firm of Alston Hunt Floyd and Ing, in response to City sweeps,&#8221; the organization said in a press release.</p>

<p>The guide is the latest in a collection of Hawai‘i-specific “Know Your Rights” materials that the local ACLU has created, including a “First Amendment Toolkit” and a “Youth Rights Guide.”&nbsp; These resources are available at <a href="https://acluhi.org/">acluhawaii.org</a>.</p>

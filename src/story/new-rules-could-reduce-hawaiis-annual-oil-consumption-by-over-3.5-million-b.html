<p>The Hawaii-based clean energy advocate Blue Planet Foundation praised President Barrack Obama&#8217;s announcement that new cars will need to achieve 39 miles per gallon by the year 2016. The new rules&#8212;including a requirement that new trucks achieve 30 miles per gallon (mpg)&#8212;represent a 42% increase in the current average standards for cars and trucks. The rules could save Hawai&#8217;i over 3.5 million barrels of oil annually.</p>

<p>&#8220;President Obama&#8217;s new efficiency rules will reduce Hawaii&#8217;s dependence on imported fuel and prevent Hawaii residents&#8217; from losing so much money at the pump,&#8221; said Jeff Mikulina, Executive Director of the Blue Planet Foundation. &#8220;President Obama deserves a big &#8216;mahalo&#8217; for this bold step toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new rules, which will be phased in starting with the 2012 model year, are estimated to save 1.8 billion barrels of oil in the U.S. over the lifetime of the vehicles regulated.</p>

<p>Gasoline represents 24% of oil consumed in Hawaii, according to statistics compiled by the state Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism for the past four years. If the average fuel efficiency of Hawaii vehicles increase from the current estimate of 25 mpg to the required 34.1 mpg under these new rules, Hawaii&#8217;s oil consumption could decrease by over 3.5 million barrels annually.</p>

<p>According to the State Department of Transportation, Hawaii currently has over 950,000 registered passenger vehicles&#8212;the type that would be regulated under the new vehicle efficiency rules.</p>

<p>The new rules also clarify that automakers can&#8217;t claim &#8220;zero emissions&#8221; for electric vehicles when calculating the average fuel economy of their fleet. Estimated power plant emissions for producing the electricity for the electric vehicles will be factored into the total.</p>

<p>&#8220;These new standards are another piece in Hawaii&#8217;s clean energy puzzle,&#8221; added Mikulina.</p>

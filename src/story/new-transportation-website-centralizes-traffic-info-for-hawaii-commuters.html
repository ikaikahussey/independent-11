<p>HONOLULU&#8212;GoAkamai is a travel tool designed to make Honolulu drivers&#8217; commutes easier and faster. The new website offers comprehensive information about real time traffic conditions on Oahu&#8217;s roadways 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.GoAkamai.org" title="GoAkamai.org">GoAkamai.org</a> is a free web service that consolidates the region&#8217;s transportation information into a one-stop resource. The website provides up-to-date information on traffic conditions; schedule, route, and fare information for public transportation services; carpool and vanpool referrals; roadway construction information; and more. </p>

<p>GoAkamai also provides links to flight information, public transportation services, and roadway construction schedules statewide. The traffic traveler information is limited to Oahu at this time, but there are plans to expand in future phases statewide.</p>

<p>The site also features snapshots from all 200 State and City cameras that are updated every five minutes. In addition, updates on road closures and detours due to construction will be posted on the website.</p>

<p>GoAkamai is also available through the use of hand-held devices such as smart phones&#8212; which, by the way, are illegal to use while driving.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The new travel is part of a larger nationwide &#8220;Intelligent Transportation Systems&#8221; (ITS) program and part of a larger program known as Advance Traveler Information Systems (ATIS).</p>

<p>The GoAkamai initiative is a cooperative program made possible by the collaboration of the Hawaii State Department of Transportation and the City and County of Honolulu Department of Transportation Services. </p>

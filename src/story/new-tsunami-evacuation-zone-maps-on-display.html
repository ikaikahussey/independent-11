<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Oahu residents are invited to attend a series of public information outreach workshops to provide coastal communities around the island a preview of the new Tsunami Evacuation Zone Maps. The first outreach workshop is scheduled for Monday, July 12 and will be held at Sunset Beach Elementary School. Workshops will run through August 2010.&nbsp; Each workshop is designed specifically for that particular community. </p>

<p>The Department of Emergency Management (DEM) is in the final phase of updating the current Oahu tsunami evacuation zone maps. This is the first revision since 1991 and was accomplished using scientific techniques and technology not available at that time.</p>

<p>Work on the new maps for Hawaii and Oahu began in 2004 and is a product of the Tsunami Inundation Mapping Project at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Funds for the mapping project were provided by a Federal Tsunami Mitigation Grant.</p>

<p>Representatives from the City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Emergency Management will be on-hand to present the new maps, discuss the implications for Oahu residents as well as answer questions. The City&#8217;s first responders will also be available to answer questions from the public.</p>

<p>“The new tsunami evacuation maps are of significant importance to our residents and the safety of their families and property,&#8221; said Melvin Kaku, director for the Department of Emergency Management. &#8220;We hope that everyone will take the opportunity to attend a presentation in their community to learn more about the new evacuation maps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Draft copies of the maps will also be posted to the department’s website at <a href="http://www.oahuDEM.org" title="www.oahuDEM.org">www.oahuDEM.org</a>.</p>

<p>The workshops will begin at 5:30 p.m. in each of the communities listed. Presentations are planned for Oahu island-wide.</p>

<p>MANOA &#8212; The new building that houses the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE) on the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa campus has won a 2011 Kukulu Hale Award from the Hawai‘i Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties or NAIOP.&nbsp; The organization is the nation’s leading trade association for developers, owners, investors, asset managers and related professionals.</p>

<p>C-MORE Hale was victor in the category of New Project – Commercial/Other, 40,000 square feet or less.&nbsp; Developer/owner was UH Mānoa, and lead design firm was Group 70 International.&nbsp; C-MORE is seeking LEED Platinum Certification.</p>

<p>The awards were presented at the annual NAIOP Awards Banquet held in May at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikīkī.&nbsp; “We can now proudly add ‘award-winning’ to the many adjectives used to describe our wonderful facility,” said Oceanography Professor David M. Karl of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology.&nbsp; </p>

<p>C-MORE is one of only 17 National Science Foundation-sponsored Science and Technology Centers.&nbsp; The building provides 30,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research laboratory and support spaces focused on the student of ocean microbes.&nbsp; Completed in 2010, C-MORE exemplifies a new direction in research facility—one that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, transparent connectivity and representation of its research mission.</p>

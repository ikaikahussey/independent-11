<p>Na Oiwi NYC presents From The Big Island to The Big Apple, a Mother&#8217;s Day celebration with traditional Hawaiian master weaver, musician, and storyteller Sam Kama and ohana on Saturday, May 8 at the American Indian Community House, 11 Broadway, in New York.</p>

<p>Kama and ohana kick off the 2010 Pasifika month at AICH. Kama is an accomplished Hawaiian slack-key guitar player having studied under legendary masters Gabby Pahinui and Raymond K?ne. Sam was born in Honolulu and will be in New York for the first time presenting cultural workshops he&#8217;s shared with children and schools throughout Hawai&#8217;i through his community organization Apopo O Na Kamali&#8217;i or The Children of Tomorrow. He will be offering his popular hands-on lau niu (coconut frond) and lau hala (pandanus) weaving workshops. Participants will learn how to weave and learn about the historic uses of these indigenous materials and crafts in Hawai&#8217;i. In addition to weaving, lei making, hula, ipu &#8216;ole, and &#8216;ukulele workshops will also be offered. Make your very own special Mother&#8217;s Day gift whether it be a papale (hat), &#8216;ohana (family) bowl, or lei. The workshops will culminate with a potluck pa&#8217;ina (party) featuring Sam and &#8216;Ohana sharing Hawaiian stories through music, song, chant and dance.</p>

<p>HONOLULU – The weekly Broadcast event at NextDoor in Chinatown becomes “Broadcast 420” on Wednesday, April 20, featuring two of Honolulu’s most widely known ska acts, Black Square and Pimpbot, as well as The Virtue, Jon Sanchez and DJ Selector Nomad. </p>

<p>Broadcast is NextDoor’s celebration of Hawaii’s musical subcultures, and the date of 4/20 ties in, presumably, with a stoner subculture, or counterculture, perhaps. Since its inception, Broadcast has featured all manner of indie artists, from punk to hip hop, from electronica to reggae rocksteady.</p>

<p>Black Square has made inroads into the national scene, having secured a spot on the 2011 Vans Warped Tour. Pimpbot has enjoyed similar notoriety in the local scene after ten years and earning a slot at last year’s South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas.</p>

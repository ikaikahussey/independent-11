<p>On Monday evening, March 16, 2015 at about 8:16 p.m., Honolulu police officers responded to the area of South King Street fronting Iolani Palace on a report of a male wearing dark-colored clothing and running in the middle of the roadway, acting erratically. Officers closed South King and Richards Streets throughout the incident.</p>

<p>According to police, the male refused to leave the roadway, continuously running away and evading the officers as they approached him. OC pepper spray was used but was ineffective as the male continued to remain on the roadway. An electric gun was deployed twice but was also ineffective. The male tripped and fell while trying to run away, at which time officers were able to gain control of the combative male and placed him under arrest. The male was escorted to the sidewalk when he suddenly became unresponsive.</p>

<p>The Emergency Services and Honolulu Fire Departments responded to the scene. The male was transported via ambulance to the Queens Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Captain Rade Vanic, a spokesperson for HPD, told the Independent that there is no cause of death available at this time.</p>

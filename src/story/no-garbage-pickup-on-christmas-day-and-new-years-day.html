<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu’s Department of Environmental Services is reminding residents that garbage will not be picked up on both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. These are the only two holidays taken by ENV’s Refuse Division.</p>

<p>If you are on twice-a-week refuse collection and your pickup day falls on one of these holidays, please hold your items for the next scheduled pickup day.</p>

<p>Communities that use the 3-cart collection system, with once per week refuse and once per week recycling pickup, are asked to leave their gray carts curbside and those will be collected on the next one or two work days (excluding Sunday). Leave the gray cart at the curb until it is serviced.</p>

<p>Recycling days that fall on these holidays will not be made up, so hold mixed recyclables and green waste for the next scheduled pickup date.</p>

<p>Bulky item collection will continue on the days following the holiday. Since bulky pickup is conducted over a 3-to-4 day period in each sector, the collection crews will make up the holiday on the following days.</p>

<p>Also, all City Convenience Centers, Transfer Stations, H-POWER and Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill will be closed on the two holidays.</p>

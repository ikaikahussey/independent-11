<p>MAUI&#8212;Native language advocates have received a verbal commitment from state education officials that there will be no lottery to fill kindergarten seats at Paia Elementary School. Instead, school officials have been instructed by interim superintendent Kathy Matayoshi to find other means to accomodate the increased enrollment, according to teacher Kahele Dukelow.</p>

<p>The Maui News <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/530289.html?nav=10">reports</a> that approximately 32 students have applied for 20 available seats in next year&#8217;s kindergarten class. 150 people participated in a <a href="http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/530347.html?nav=10">rally</a> to last week to stop the proposed lottery.</p>

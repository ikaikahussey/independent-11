<p>Mayoral, congressional, and gubernatorial candidates including Neil Abercrombie, John Carroll, Mufi Hannemann, Colleen Hanabusa, Ramsay Wharton, Kirk Caldwell, Peter Carlisle, Panos Prevedouros, and Rod Tam will discuss how they will work with the nonprofit sector if elected.</p>

<p>The nonpartisan forum is being staged by “No Vote, No Grumble” and PHOCUSED (Protecting Hawaii’s Ohana, Children, Under Served, Elderly and Disabled) to encourage the public to register to vote and educate themselves on issues that that impact them and their families.</p>

<p>The audience will include participants and supporters from concerned social service agencies who have agreed to work together with PHOCUSED to encourage the public to register to vote and educate themselves on issues that that impact them and their families.&nbsp; Organizations participating include Hawaiian Civics Clubs, Kamehameha Schools, Partners in Development Foundation, Child and Family Services, YWCA, Goodwill Industries, Easter Seals, Lanakila Pacific and Catholic Charities Hawai’i. </p>

<p>“Since 2006, there has been a continual drop in participation in the electoral races in Hawaii and the state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the nation,” said Alex Santiago, Executive Director of PHOCUSED. “We really saw how our elected officials’ decisions impacted us and our families this past year: furlough days, health care coverage, homelessness, crime, to name a few. If we want to make a difference, we must let our voices be heard.”</p>

<p>PHOCUSED is a newly established nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to increasing the safety for, visibility of, and investment in children and adults in Hawaii who are marginalized, impoverished, and underserved and for whom access to health, human services, and housing is critical.</p>

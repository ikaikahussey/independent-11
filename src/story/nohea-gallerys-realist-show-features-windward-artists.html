<p>KAILUA&#8212;Nohea Gallery&#8217;s Kailua location, Nohea Island Arts in Kailua, will be presenting the work of Hawaii&#8217;s premiere Realist artists from May 28 through July 2. The &#8220;Windward Realists Show&#8221; features the work of Windward Community College (WCC) art professors and lecturers Snowden Hodges, Jonathan Busse, and Norm Graffam, and artists Rene Darrow, Madeleine McKay, and Jill Butterbaugh.</p>

<p>The show takes place during Nohea&#8217;s 20th anniversary in the islands and brings a unique glimpse into Hawaii&#8217;s Realist movement.</p>

<p>Nohea co-owner Laurie Baron said: &#8220;The Realist movement is very strong. This is a rare opportunity for our residents to see contemporary work from the Realist School here in Hawaii. Snowden Hodges is considered by many to be a master in the field of Realism. It is a pleasure to share the work of Snowden Hodges and his colleagues with our community.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Snowden Hodges</b> paints and draws in the contemporary realist style and enjoys an extensive exhibition record in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Living and working in Honolulu since 1978, his work is represented in many national and international private, public, and corporate collections including the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. and the British Institute of Florence, Italy. Hodges is the originator of <a href="http://www.wcc.hawaii.edu/Atelierhawaii/" title="Atelier Hawaii">Atelier Hawaii</a>, offered by WCC. </p>

<p><b>Jonathan Busse</b> was born in Arizona and moved to Hawaii in 1965. He grew up in Kailua within walking distance of the beach where he developed his love and appreciation for nature. He received his Master of Fine Arts degree in Drawing and Painting from the University of Hawaii in 1985. Mentored by Snowden Hodges, Busse currently teaches introductory level painting courses in the UH system. Busse has been widely exhibited since 1983 and his work is in numerous respected collections including: the Ala Moana Hotel, American Savings Bank, Bank of Hawaii, the Contemporary Art Museum, Hyatt Hotels, the State Foundation on Culture and the Arts, and the Mayor&#8217;s Office of Culture and the Arts, City and County of Honolulu.</p>

<p><b>Jill Butterbaugh</b> has been living and painting in Hawaii since 1979. She graduated with a Bachelor in Fine Arts degree from the University of Hawaii in 2005. From still life and landscapes to life-size portraits, her paintings are done mostly in oil although she enjoys working in watercolors as well as drawing in charcoal and conte. Originally from Southern California, Jill moved to Oahu in 1979 and currently lives in Kailua with her husband and three sons.</p>

<p><b>Rene Darrow</b> has studied for 18 years with Snowden Hodges and has taken Norm Graffam&#8217;s classes as well. Hodges said, &#8220;We invited Rene to join us in this show because she is so extremely talented, although she is very modest about it. Her work demonstrates a masterful, rich use of color&#8212;from delicate watercolors to rich oils. Rene is an extraordinary artist.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>Norman Graffam</b> began drawing at an early age and has been painting since 1994. He is an award-winning painter with works in public and private collections both local and national. He has taught at Kapiolani Community College and at UH Manoa. He currently teaches a number of beginning and intermediate art courses at WCC. Norman finds it &#8220;rewarding to have a career working with adult students whose purpose for being in college is to make their lives better and to learn to draw and paint.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Madeleine McKay</b> hails from Dublin, Ireland where she first studied painting at the College of Art and Design. She continued her studies at Blake College in London and in 2005, she attended Atelier Hawaii. A member of the International Guild of Realism, McKay employs chiaroscuro and dramatic color to underscore the emotions of romantic realism portrayed in her work. Her technique recalls the paintings of the Old Masters, while her subject matter reflects her views today.</p>

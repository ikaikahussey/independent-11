<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) will resume acceptance of non-combustible waste at all refuse convenience centers on a limited basis beginning Tuesday, March 1. Householders will be allowed one load of non-combustible waste per week during the month of March, until further notice.</p>

<p>Previously, the City restricted householders from disposing of non-combustible waste at its six convenience centers&#8212;Ewa, Laie, Wahiawa, Waianae, Waimanalo, and Waipahu&#8212;while Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill (WGSL) was undergoing repairs to address the effects of the unusual storm event on January 12.</p>

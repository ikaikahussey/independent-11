<p>MANOA&#8212;When Hawaii became a state in 1959, voter turnout was 84 percent in the primary election, one of the highest rates in the United States. By the 2008 primary, turnout in the islands was down to 37 percent, among the lowest rates in the country. A University of Hawaii at Manoa “Use Your Voice, Use Your Vote” rally hopes to reverse that trend. The rally will be held on the lawn fronting Hawaii Hall (facing Varney Circle) from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Tuesday, October 26.</p>

<p>The free, public rally is a non-partisan effort encouraging eligible voters to exercise their right to vote. There will be live music, informational and voter registration booths, giveaways of signed Jack Johnson CDs, and free light refreshments.</p>

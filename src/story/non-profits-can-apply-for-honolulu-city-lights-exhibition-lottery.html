<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Non-profit organizations interested in creating displays on the Civic Center grounds during the annual Honolulu City Lights exhibition are invited to submit applications to the Customer Services Department by Monday, August 30 at 550 South King Street, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813.</p>

<p>Permits will be issued for five display sites via a lottery scheduled for Monday, September 13. The lottery will be held at 10:00 a.m. in the Mayorâ€™s Conference Room, 3rd Floor, Honolulu Hale, 530 South King Street. Applicants are welcome to attend the lottery, but need not be present to be selected.</p>

<p>The annual lottery was started several years ago in response to requests from private groups interested in erecting displays at the same time as the holiday event.</p>

<p>Displays chosen through the lottery process will be on view during the same period as Honolulu City Lights. Each organization that receives a permit will be responsible for the set-up, maintenance, and takedown of its display.</p>

<p>Applicants must be bona fide non-profit organizations formed under HRS Chapter 415B or any charitable organization formed pursuant to HRS Chapter 467B or under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code. Proof of this designation must be submitted with the application by August 30, to be eligible for the lottery.</p>

<p>Interested groups should contact Mike Freitas in the Complaints Office at (808) 768-4381 to request a copy of the application and the rules governing the use of the grounds during Honolulu City Lights.</p>

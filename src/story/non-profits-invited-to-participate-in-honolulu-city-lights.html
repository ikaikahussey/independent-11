<p>DOWNTOWN&#8212;Non-profit organization leaders interested in creating a Civic Center grounds display during the annual Honolulu City Lights exhibition are invited to submit applications to the Customer Services Department by August 26.</p>

<p>Permits will be issued for five display sites by a lottery scheduled for Monday, September 12. The lottery will be held at 10:00 a.m. in the Mission Memorial Hearings Conference Room at 550 South King St. Applicants are welcome to attend the lottery, but need not be present to be selected.</p>

<p>The annual lottery was started several years ago in response to requests from private groups interested in building displays for the holiday event. Displays selected by lottery will be on view during Honolulu City Lights. Each organization that receives a permit must set up, maintain, and take down their display.</p>

<p>Applicants must be qualified non-profit organizations under HRS Chapter 41 SB or any charitable organization formed pursuant to HRS Chapter 467B or under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code. Proof of this designation must be submitted with the original application by August 26, to be eligible for the lottery.</p>

<p>Interested groups should contact the Complaints Office at (808) 768-4381 for a copy of the application and rules governing the use of the grounds during Honolulu City Lights. </p>

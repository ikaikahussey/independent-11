<p>City monthly reports:</p>

<p>Honolulu Fire Department: No representative present; no report was given.</p>

<p>Honolulu Police Department (HPD): Capt. Heu and Lt. Osbun reported;</p>

<p>Introduction: New Lt. Gregory Osbun was introduced to the Board and the community.</p>

<p>Gil Riviere arrived at 7:07 p.m.; nine (9) members present.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>1. Crime Rates: A newspaper article listing District 2 as the district with the highest crime rate on Oahu was presented to the Board. It was pointed out that though HPD is working hard, District 2 is the largest district on Oahu. It was stated that letters to HPD have previously been sent by the Board requesting that more officers be assigned to District 2; however, it was requested that a new letter be sent along with the news article to Chief Kealoha of HPD.</p>

<p>2. Service Calls: It was expressed that HPD needs evidence to prove that there is a need for more officers in the area. It was requested that a policy be adopted to ensure a report is filled out for every service call responded to. It was stated that though many calls may not be of significance, a report provides evidence of activity in the area.</p>

<p>Ng moved, Matsuura seconded to send the news article with a letter requesting for more officers in District 2 to Chief Kealoha of HPD. The motion was ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY, 9-0-0 (AYE: Bellows, J. Leinau, R. Leinau, Lyons, Matsuura, Ng, Pahinui, Riviere, and Scoville.)</p>

<p>3. Officers Per Area: It was asked but, HPD was not sure of the correlation between the number officers in an area and population density. HPD stated that the way to get more beats in an area is to receive more calls.</p>

<p>Mayor Mufi Hannemann’s Representative: Alenka Remec reported;</p>

<p>Waialua Tennis Courts: The Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) can issue a permit to Waialua High School (WHS) for two courts at Waialua District Park for tennis meets; however, permits will not be issued for practices. While DPR is sympathetic to WHS, there are many high schools that desire access to public parks. The existing rules were written to address the demands for tennis courts islandwide. </p>

<p>Satellite City Hall: There are no plans to build an additional satellite city hall in the North Shore area as the start up cost is prohibitive. At minimum, a rent free satellite city hall office start up cost would require funds of $300,000 and cost $135,000 a year to maintain. Additional locations may be considered in the future when the financial situation of the City improves.</p>

<p>Haleiwa Road/Kamehameha Highway &amp; Waialua Beach Road/Goodale Avenue Intersections: A letter has been sent to Councilmember Dela Cruz addressing the issue.</p>

<p>Kaukonahua Road Access: The Department of Transportation Services (DTS) is currently investigating several aspects of the access design with regards to traffic safety. DTS will respond to the Board with results of the study in July.</p>

<p>Sunset Beach Recreational Center Classes: DPR will consider adding more art programs if there is sufficient interest. Implementation will depend on availability of class time, space and instructors. The mission of the center is to offer a variety of recreational opportunities for all ages.</p>

<p>Pupukea Rockfall Mitigation Project: The project is limited to the upper slope.&nbsp; The existing physical dimensions of the road preclude constructing wider shoulders. Archeologists have also found significant historical sites on the upper and lower slopes of the road that limit what can be done.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed;</p>

<p>Sunset Beach Recreational Center: It was clarified that the concern was a lack of youth art programs being offered at the Sunset Beach Recreational Center. It was also asked if a teacher would be allowed to charge students for art classes.</p>

<p>Waialua Tennis Courts: It was requested that an exception be made to allow WHS to use Waialua District Park tennis courts as WHS is so secluded from other tennis court alternatives.</p>

<p>Kaukonahua Road: It was requested that alternate entrances to Kaukonahua Road properties be evaluated.</p>

<p>Board of Water Supply (BWS): George Kuo reported;</p>

<p>Water Main Breaks: There were no water main breaks in May 2010.</p>

<p>- Water Quality: BWS conducts thousands of tests on the water source and distribution system to ensure that the water service to customers meets or exceeds all federal and state safe drinking water standards. The results of those tests will be shared to all customers in BWS’s annual water quality report. Customers should receive this report by July 1, 2010.

<p>Summer Water Conservation: Residents were reminded of ways to save water: 1) Check home for leaks, 2) Turn off the tap when brushing teeth or shaving, 3) Install a nozzle on your garden hose and 4) Don’t water lawns between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.</p>

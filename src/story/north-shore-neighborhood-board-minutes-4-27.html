<p>CITY MONTHYLY REPORTS:</p>

<p>Honolulu Fire Department (HFD): No representatives present; no report was available.</p>

<p>Honolulu Police Department (HPD): Officer Aoki reported;</p>

<p>March Statistics: 7 Auto thefts, 7 auto theft recoveries, 16 burglaries, 25 car break ins and 17 other thefts.</p>

<p>7:05 Phillips arrived; 11 members present.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Abandoned Vehicles: Clarification on the law concerning abandoned vehicles was requested. It was stated that any vehicle left stationary for a period of twenty - four (24) hours or more is classified as abandoned. The public was advised to call the police and that HPD must see the abandoned vehicle to file a report and have it towed.</p>

<p>Car Break Ins: It was asked what factors contributed to the reduction of car thefts in March. There was no clear answer given.</p>

<p>Mayor Mufi Hannemann&#8217;s Representative - Alenka Remec reported;</p>

<p>2011 City Operating Budget: Furloughs are pending the negotiations which are in progress with between the unions and the City. The overall Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 City operating budget is $1.827 billion, which is a 1.2 percent increase over the current fiscal year. Reasons for increases include:</p>

<p>- Previously negotiated raises to the Police Union, the Firefighters Union and bus drivers will require an additional $20 million next year.<br />
- Fringe benefits for all City employees to increase by $16 million. This includes FICA, Unemployment, Workers&#8217; Compensation, Employee Retirement System, and Health Fund increases.</p>

<p>- President Obama has selected Honolulu to host the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in the fall of 2011. Honolulu was selected due to the tremendous work of Honolulu public safety agencies. Hosting the conference will require reinforcement of security systems. The FY 2011 budget includes an additional $14 million for Police, Fire, Emergency Management, and Emergency Services. Without these uncontrollable cost increases and the cost to prepare for APEC, the operating budget would be $1.510 billion</p>

<p>Waialua Beach Road Lights: Per B. Yee of the Department of Design and Construction (DDC), all lights are still under contract (Standard Electric). All lights working.</p>

<p>Ehukai Beach Park Showers: The water pressure at the Ehukai Beach Park showers are approximately 60 lb. which is within the normal operating range for the water supply system. Each shower is controlled by a separate valve that regulates how much water comes out of the shower. The Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) has installed shower flow restrictors but, beach goers have removed them because they prefer more flow to rinse off themselves and their boards. DPR concurs with the complainant that beach goers should not waste water.</p>

<p>Pupukea Road Lights: Light repaired on April 15th. All other lights operating properly.</p>

<p>Haleiwa Road No Parking Sign: The Department of Transportation Services will be conducting an investigation and will inform the board of their findings by the July 2010 Neighborhood Board meeting.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed;</p>

<p>Waialua Recreational Center: It was requested that the recreational center tennis courts be repaired so that student athletes may be allowed to practice closer to home instead of traveling to other sites to do so.</p>

<p>7:10 Miller arrived; 12 members present.</p>

<p>Board Of Water Supply (BWS): George Kuo and Sandy Nahoopii-Wong reported;</p>

<p>Water Main Breaks: There were no water main breaks reported in March.</p>

<p>General Water Announcements: Many Oahu communities were first established more than a century ago. As these communities age, many portions of the infrastructure like roads, sewers, and water mains are also aging and nearing the end of their useful life spans. The Board of Water Supply (BWS) system includes nearly 2,000 miles of pipeline, with more than 40% between 30 and 60 years old. In an ongoing effort to provide a safe and reliable water supply, BWS carefully manages and plans for the renewal and replacement of its infrastructure.</p>

<p>7:15 Pahinui arrived; 13 members present.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Pupukea Waterline: Multiple concerns over the Pupukea waterline project were raised. It was expressed as a hazard and an inconvenience especially during afternoon hours due to parents picking up children at schools. It was also stated that traffic will affect Haleiwa businesses in the upcoming summer months. Suggested resolutions included: Night construction, temporary construction pauses during the day to allow for regular afternoon traffic, shortening the daily amount of time that construction can be done and dividing work between morning and evening hours to allow for traffic flow in the afternoon. It was answered that night construction posed a noise problem to surrounding residents and the early shut down or temporary halt of daily construction would not be practical for crews to get sufficient work done and would only delay the total length of the project.</p>

<p>Watershed Projects: Representation was requested for watershed projects in the area.</p>

<p>Councilmember Donovan Dela Cruz: Reed Matsuura reported;</p>

<p>Bill 7 &amp; 8: The Council approved and the Mayor has signed to law an ordinance that prohibits tents without a permit and shopping carts from being used at city parks. The administration initiated legislation was to address concerns from residents that parks were becoming harder to use because of the increase of tents in parks. Many councilmembers including Councilmember Dela Cruz battled with the reality that this legislation would directly impact the homeless. The original legislation was fairly restrictive with the amended version allowing apparatuses with one wall to be used and falling in the definition of a tent. Therefore, canopies can still be used with a wall set up to block the wind. Tents are not being prohibited at parks; rather, it is required to have a permit use.</p>

<p>-Haleiwa Walkway improvements - $2,000,000 plan and design.<br />

<p>Requests for Investigation:</p>

<p>-Kaukonahua Road&#8212;dangerous driveway Is being investigated by DTS<br />
-Haleiwa Road/Haleiwa AliI Beach Park&#8212;signage for no parking between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on makai side of Haleiwa Road DTS is still investigating.<br />

-Department of Facility Maintenance is sending letters to all Paukawila, Kaukonahua and KiikiI Stream owners in regards to their responsibilities for maintenance.<br />

<p>Kiikii Stream Bridge: Question was raised about funding for a bike path on Kiikii Stream Bridge. It was answered that the bike path cannot be built until guardrails are redone because bicycle heights are currently higher than existing guardrails and would be unsafe for cyclists. An additional extension to the bridge would also be required to allow for the bike path. Costs were estimated at $1.5 million.</p>

<p>Kaiaka Bathroom Replacement: A question was raised about when funds would be appropriated for the replacement of the Kaiaka Bay beach park. It was answered that in order to make the necessary repairs without shutting down the park, a new bathroom would need to be constructed before the existing bathroom could be demolished. It was answered that a request to implement a new master plan has been made but, it has been denied.</p>

<p>Haleiwa Town Walkways: It was requested to pave the sidewalks along Haleiwa road. It was answered that DTS has been contacted and that the city is currently working on it.

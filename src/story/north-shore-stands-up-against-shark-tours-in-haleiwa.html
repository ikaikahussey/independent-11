<p>HALEIWA&#8212;Approximately 50 community activists of all ages marched at Alii Beach Park wearing red t-shirts with ti leaves and signs in hand to protest against commercial shark feeding on Saturday, February 20. Hui O Hee Nalu and Safe Waters for Hawaii, groups committed to stopping illegal commercial shark feedings in Hawaii, organized the march to send a message to North Shore shark tour companies to follow state and federal laws prohibiting shark feeding for commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Mahina Chillingsworth, vice president of Hui O Hee Nalu, said their number of supporters grew to around 200 as passersby stopped to join in. Chillingsworth also estimated that around 75 arrived in support of the North Shore&#8217;s two commercial shark tour companies, North Shore Shark Adventures and Hawaii Shark Encounters.</p>

<p>On the Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources website, <a href="http://hawaii.gov/dlnr/dar/regulations_special_provis.html" title="HRS 188-40.6">HRS 188-40.6</a> clearly states that it is unlawful to conduct any activity related to the feeding of sharks in State waters. The State law is in effect for waters from shore to three miles out, something North Shore Shark Adventures states they abide by&#8212;their website says that they travel three to four miles from shore for the tours. Federal law against shark feeding explains that it is unlawful to introduce food into the water to attract sharks for any other purpose than to harvest sharks from shore to 200 nautical miles out to sea.</p>

<p>Hui O Hee Nalu and Safe Waters for Hawaii&#8217;s main concern is that shark feeding is a threat to public safety. They said feeding the sharks off-sets their natural feeding habits and disrupts the natural food chain in the ocean, which in turn create safety concerns for surfers, swimmers, and fisherman who believe that sharks in search of food are becoming more prone to approach humans. </p>

<p>Anti-shark feeding activists also feel that the practice is disrespectful to the Hawaiian culture, as sharks are often aumakua, guardian spirits, for Native Hawaiians.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cultural concern is they are profiting from our Hawaiian aumakua,&#8221; Chillingsworth said on Tuesday. &#8220;It&#8217;s a direct slap in the face to Native Hawaiians as we are taught to leave them be.&#8221; Feeding sharks for cultural purposes is a practice protected by state law, stating that sharks may be fed by humans for traditional Hawaiian cultural or religious practices, provided it is not part of a commercial activity.</p>

<p>Shark tours were shut down by the companies for Saturday&#8217;s protest and tour supporters stood their ground waving signs in defense of the businesses. Shark tour supporters cite preserving local jobs as a reason to keep the shark viewing tours up and running.</p>

<p>Chillingsworth said, &#8220;We are not anti-business and support their tour companies as it gives tourists the opportunity to view our beautiful ocean. All we&#8217;re saying is conduct your business in a legal manner and don&#8217;t feed the sharks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Safe Waters for Hawaii played a large role in helping Ordinance 3680 pass last year to ban shark viewing tours in Maui County, which encompasses Kahoolawe, Lanai, Maui, and Molokai. The organization created a petition against shark tours and feeding which circulated the North Shore, resulting in 1,000 signatures of community members.</p>

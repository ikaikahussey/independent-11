When they fled the presidential palace in February 1986, Ferdinand Marcos and his family left behind handwritten diaries spanning the years 1969-1984. Since then, they have been in the custody of the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Prof. Ocampo is preparing the diaries for publication, collating from different manuscript sources, and annotating from newspapers and the Official Gazette. He will present an assessment of Marcos’ own view of events during the years chronicled by the diaries.</p>

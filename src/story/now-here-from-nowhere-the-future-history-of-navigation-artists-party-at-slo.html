<p>An artists reception for &#8220;Now Here from Nowhere: The Future History of Navigation&#8221; happens at Slow Art Friday, January 21, from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. </p>

<p>Festivities include a Pauahi Street party with a 40-foot Euro-style table, acrobats, live music, organic food, and wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Here from Nowhere&#8221; is a new juried exhibition running through February 26 that started with an open call to the community last August. The exhibition showcases over 30 artists with innovative maps, way-finding, and artful directions for the course of our vehicle, our community, and our life. Artists share their interpretations, strategies, depictions, and instructions about a past that has yet to occur.</p>

<p>Ultimately, &#8220;Now Here from Nowhere&#8221; is a mix of open call responses, invited artists, and community group partners flavored with related programs that tackle an important theme to help foster the contemporary regional aesthetic. </p>

<p>The ARTS at Marks Garage exhibit program strives to position Hawaii internationally by showcasing art and artists reflecting our Pacific Rim and Pacific Basin connections, our key position between East and West, and our unique cultural diversity.</p>

<p>The Polynesian Voyaging Society and Naalehu Anthony &amp; have arranged for the overhead installation of the steering paddle of the <i>Hōkūleʻa</i> (and by extension the Hawaiian cultural renaissance.) This cultural icon is 20 feet long and has traveled over 50,000 miles with famous voyagers &#8220;Mau&#8221; Piailug, Nainoa Thompson, and Eddie Aikau.</p>

<p>Participating artists include: Megan Bent, Eric Chun, Richard Duggan, David Friedman, Sean Michael Gallagher, Sonny Ganaden, Kris Goto, Scott Groeniger, Lauren Jo, Corneleia Jolitz, Sheri Lyles, Jane Mi, Tamara Moan, Dee Mosher, Maya Lea Portner, Kristen Rae Simonsen, Laura Smith, Neil Tepper, Rex Vicek, Jon Wild, Cate Wyatt-Magalian, Marc Yoakum, and a collaboration from U.H.Manoa Art Department.</p>

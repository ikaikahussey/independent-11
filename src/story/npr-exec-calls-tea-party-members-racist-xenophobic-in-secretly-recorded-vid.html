<p>In a video released Tuesday morning by conservative filmmaker James O&#8217;Keefe, NPR executive Ron Schiller disparages conservatives in general and Tea Party members in particular, saying some of its followers are part of an &#8220;anti-intellectual&#8221; movement, <i><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/08/AR2011030803148.html?hpid=topnews" target="_blank">The Washington Post reported</a>.</i></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20040683-503544.html" target="_blank">CBS News</a> reminds readers how O&#8217;Keefe&#8217;s deceptively edited hidden camera videos, in which it notoriously made ACORN employees to look like they were dealing with him while he was dressed like a pimp, have made him a star on the right.</p>

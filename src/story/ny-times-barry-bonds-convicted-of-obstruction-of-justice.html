<p>SAN FRANCISCO&#8212;Former Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds has been convicted of obstruction of justice in the ongoing case regarding his alleged use of performance enhancing drugs while he was a player. He faces up to ten years in prison, although it is unlikely that he will serve anything close to that sentence, if he is sentenced to prison at all. A mistrial was declared on on a number of other charges faced by Bonds.</p>

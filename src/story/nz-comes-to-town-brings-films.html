<p>Aotearoa – known to some as New Zealand – will be represented this coming week at the Doris Duke Theatre, with a film festival that features four diverse and daring films—from a documentary depicting an up-and-coming world leader to narrative fictions with provocative social commentaries.<br />
￼￼￼<br />
The festival opens on June 15 with Māori Boy Genius, an inspiring film about a charismatic Yale-bound youth who champions his people and is revered by his community. The screening is preceded by a 6 p.m. opening reception featuring live performances by the Māori dance troupe Rātapu and food for purchase from Da Spot.</p>

<p>“New Zealand is known for its unique film culture, strong documentary tradition and wicked sense of humor— as viewers will see in Fresh Meat—and I don&#8217;t think this year&#8217;s line-up will disappoint,” says film curator Abbie Algar. “The films we&#8217;ve selected continue to touch on themes that emerged in last year&#8217;s festival, exploring the meaning of community and spiritual identity within Māori culture, and offering great starting points for a continued dialogue in our own community.”</p>

<p>Louisa Te’i, co-organizer of the festival, describes her excitement for the festival and confirms that Hawai’i audiences have a lot to look forward to: “I am proud that each of the feature films has a Māori element that makes it unique to Aotearoa. Because of our common Polynesian ancestry and Pacific proximity, Hawaii audiences will be able to easily relate and connect with these movies.”</p>

<p>WHAT: Second Annual Aotearoa New Zealand Film Festival<br />
WHERE: Honolulu Museum of Art Doris Duke Theatre, 901 Kinau St., at rear of museum<br />
WHEN: June 15-21<br />
HOW MUCH: Regular festival screenings: $10, $8 museum members; opening night: $15, $12 museum members</p>

<p>HONOLULU — Assistant U.S. Attorney Ken Sorenson said Benjamin Pierce Bishop, 60, confessed to taking home top-secret government documents and sending an email to his girlfriend that included details about a classified meeting with officials from the U.S. and South Korea about existing war plans.</p>

<p>Bishop pleaded guilty in March to two counts, including “willfully communicating classified national defense information to a person not authorized to receive it and unlawfully retaining classified national defense information at his home.”</p>

<p>Bishop became romantically involved with the Chinese student in June 2011 but hid the relationship from government officials, an FBI affidavit said.</p>

<p>Bishop was required to disclose contact with foreign nationals but failed to do so; on a travel form he changed his girlfriend’s first name to a masculine version to disguise her gender and identity, the affidavit said.</p>

<p>According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s office, Bishop disclosed information related to joint training and planning sessions.</p>

<p>Bishop also admitted to keeping at his home multiple classified documents that related to the national defense, including a U.S. Armed Forces Defense Planning Guide and a classified photograph of a Chinese naval asset Bishop retrieved from classified sources based on a request from the Chinese woman.</p>

<p>The documents were taken from Bishop’s workplace at U.S. Pacific Command, the U.S. attorney’s office said.</p>

<p>If the information fell into the hands of a foreign power that country would have access to hundreds of facts about military strategies, resources, location of those resources, Sorenson said.</p>

<p>“It would be a treasure trove for a foreign government. And we know the foreign governments that we are involved with in the Pacific arena.”</p>

<p>Bishop said in court he never intended to hurt the United States and was only trying to help his girlfriend with her research.</p>

<p>Bishop’s attorney, Birney Bervar, blamed his client’s error in judgment on love, not espionage.</p>

<p>“There was no intent to harm the United States. He made an error, a serious error in judgment for the love of a woman. As one of his friends said in a letter, quoting Shakespeare, ‘He loved not wisely, but too well,’” Bervar said.</p>

<p>Before issuing the sentence, Judge Leslie Kobayashi said she believed Bishop had no intent to harm the United States, but he appeared to be under the woman’s spell.</p>

<p>“This person has compromised you completely,” Kobayashi told Bishop.</p>

<p>Sorenson said foreign governments are sending college and graduate students to the United States to get classified and non-classified information, and the students are expected to use sexual and romantic relationships to get it.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Flo Nakakuni said this is the second major espionage case prosecuted in the District of Hawaii, and it’s particularly troubling because it involves the communication of classified information to a citizen of the People’s Republic of China.</p>

<p>Hawaii resident Noshir Sheriarji Gowadia was sentenced to 32 years in prison in 2011 on espionage-related charges. Sorenson was the lead prosecutor on both cases.</p>

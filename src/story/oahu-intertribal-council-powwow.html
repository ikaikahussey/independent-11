<p>“Each dance has its own history; each dancer has a story to tell; each drum beat reunites everyone in spirit and purpose,” reads a tag line for the 40th annual Oʻahu Intertribal Council Powwow. On Saturday, October 4 and Sunday, October 5 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thomas Square will be transformed into a gathering place for American Indians and Native Alaskans who live in Hawaiʻi as well as visiting American Indians from the mainland, Alaska and Canada.</p>

<p>The Honolulu Powwow gives Oʻahu residents an opportunity to experience the “sights, sounds, flavors, and spirit of Native America.” The theme this year is “Honoring Our Elders,” and the free event will feature dancing, drumming, singing, stories, American Indian &amp; Native Alaskan handmade arts, crafts and jewelry as well as traditional native foods, such as fry bread and Indian Tacos. </p>

<p>The public is also invited to the Waikiki Community Center Intertribal Powwow on Wednesday October 1 from 4–9 p.m. A $5 donation will be asked for at the Waikīkī event.<br />
 <br />
The Honolulu Powwow is seeking volunteers as well—no experience required. For more information, email honolulupowwow@gmail.com or visit the Powwow <a href="http://www.honoluluintertribalpowwow.com">website</a>.</p>

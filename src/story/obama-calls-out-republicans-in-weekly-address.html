<p>In his weekly address, President Barack Obama called on Republicans in Congress to &#8220;put scoring political points aside, and instead to focus on solving the problems facing the nation.&#8221; The White House has said that the Republican leadership is blocking progress on a bill to boost the economy, retain jobs for teachers and cops, and help people buy their first home; another bill which would hold oil companies accountable for any disasters they cause by removing the current $75 million liability cap; and 136 highly qualified men and women who have been nominated to government positions.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama drew a sharp line on Tuesday between Republican and Democratic plans to cut the U.S. deficit, but said a deal could be reached despite big ideological differences between the two parties. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/19/usa-budget-idUSN1929910120110419" target="_blank">Reuters reports</a>. Democrats and Republicans agree that $4 trillion needs to be slashed over roughly a decade, Obama told a town hall-style event in Virginia. But they disagree on what to cut to get there.</p>

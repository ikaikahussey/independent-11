<p>A student at a town hall-style event asked President Barack Obama if he believed homosexuality is a choice. Obama responded he was no expert, then added: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a choice. I think people are born with a certain make-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all children of God,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t make determinations about who we love. That&#8217;s why I think discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is wrong.&#8221;</p>

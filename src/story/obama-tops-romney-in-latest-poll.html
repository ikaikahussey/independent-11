<p>A new poll conducted by CNN and ORC puts President Obama leading Mitt Romney 52 percent to 46 percent after reporting last week that the candidates were tied at 48 percent. The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percent. Some experts claim this only a spike after the Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;President Barack Obama today unveiled his $3.73 trillion federal budget for fiscal year 2012. In conjunction, the Obama administration has launched three days of conference call briefings that explain various aspects of the budget. These briefings are broken down by interest groups.</p>

<p>The President said the budget aims to cut wasteful spending, while keeping the investments needed to grow the economy and create jobs. It targets scarce federal resources to the areas critical to winning the future: education, innovation, clean energy, and infrastructure. And it proposes to reform how Washington does business, put more federal funding up for competition, and reorganize government so that it better serves the American people.</p>

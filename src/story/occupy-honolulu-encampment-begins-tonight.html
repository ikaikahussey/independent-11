<p>Occupy Honolulu announced an encampment at Thomas Square beginning tonight, based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kānāwai_Māmalahoe">Law of the Splintered Paddle</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s their full statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>OCCUPY HONOLULU</p>

<p>From the occupied ‘āina of Hawai&#8217;i in solidarity with the peoples of occupied lands worldwide</p>

<p>Members of Occupy Honolulu will be establishing an encampment at Thomas Square (925 S Beretania) TONIGHT (November 5, 2011) beginning at 10pm when the park closes.&nbsp; We are establishing a camp to address the urgent issues affecting our country.&nbsp; Our political and economic systems do not serve the needs of the people.&nbsp; We stand in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement around the world.&nbsp; From the occupied ‘āina of Hawai&#8217;I,&nbsp; we stand in solidarity with the peoples of occupied lands worldwide.&nbsp; We stand in solidarity with the houseless people who are being forced from the streets and parks they call home as a result of the upcoming APEC meetings.&nbsp; We believe that our first amendment rights do not end at 10pm.&nbsp; We will stand our ground to assemble peacefully to petition the government for a redress of our grievances.&nbsp; We will lay by the road in accordance with Kānāwai Māmalahoe, or Law of the Splintered Paddle, which states that we may be free to go forth and lay by the roadside without fear of harm.&nbsp; This is sacred Hawaiian law and a part of the Hawai’i State Constitution, Article 9, Section 10.&nbsp; We invoke our rights to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the freedom to lay by the roadside without harm.&nbsp; Should the Honolulu Police Department choose to prevent this action, we believe they are breaking the laws set forth by the Constitution of the United States, the Hawai’i State Constitution, and sacred Hawaiian law. There is a chance some will be arrested tonight. We ask that all media outlets send representatives to Thomas Square before 10pm tonight to cover this event.&nbsp; We ask that all supporters of Occupy Honolulu come out to Thomas Square tonight and support us in this action.&nbsp; If arrests occur, please call the Honolulu Police Department at 808-225-5473 to ask for our release and request vegan meals for those who need them.&nbsp; Also, we ask all supporters to please return to Thomas Square tomorrow to establish a permanent presence at the park.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

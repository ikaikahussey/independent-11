<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A growing group of like-minded citizens called Occupy Honolulu, in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, considers itself a leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors, genders, and political persuasions. And they&#8217;ve got a lot on their mind.</p>

<p>The Occupy Honolulu General Assembly has announced another community gathering to be held from 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 22 at Magic Island, Ala Moana Beach Park. The gathering will be a potluck and fair style event and will feature a variety of activities including food, music, art, workshops, and teach-ins.</p>

<p>A soap box is scheduled from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. so individuals may share their stories and their reasons for becoming involved with the movement. There will also be sign waving on Ala Moana and Atkinson. The event is planned as a family-friendly event. Participants are asked to bring their own reusable mess kits and water bottles. </p>

<p>Occupy Honolulu said in a statement: &#8220;The one thing we all have in common is that we are the 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 percent. We are using the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic to achieve our ends and encourage the use of nonviolence to maximize the safety of all participants. We will not be silent. Join us.&#8221; </p>

<p>Occupy Honolulu has a general assembly meeting scheduled for Saturday, October 22 at 4:00 p.m. at Magic Island following the community gathering. Additional general assembly meetings are scheduled for Sunday, October 23; Monday, October 24; and Tuesday, October 25 at 6:00 p.m. at Thomas Square (925 South Beretania Street). The general assembly makes all decisions using a consensus process to ensure that all voices are heard. All members of the community are welcome to attend.</p>

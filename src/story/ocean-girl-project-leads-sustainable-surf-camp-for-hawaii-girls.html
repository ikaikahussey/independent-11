<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The idea for a sustainable surf camp began one day on a beautiful wave in Hawaii and stirred the hearts and minds of a small group of local female surfers. The intention was then and is now to share with young girls in Hawaii the love of the ocean through surfing, water safety, sustainable practices, mentorship, and mutual respect for land, sea, and each other and impact their lives in a positive way.</p>

<p>It is now reality and begins July 26 to 30. Financial aid is available and will be a single use plastic free camp experience.</p>

<p>The surf camp is sponsored primarily by volunteers from nonprofit group <a href="http://Becausewesurf.com" title="Becausewesurf.com">BecauseWeSurf.com</a> (BWS). The BWS volunteer force has been helping with everything from beach clean ups to childrenâ€™s fund raising events since 2008. </p>

<p>Ocean Girl Project can take 10 girls for July ages 12-15, and there are 4 openings left. The camp runs Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. for the week of July 26 to 30. The number one requirement is the ability to swim and enrollment is a simple form and interview by the camp coordinator. </p>

<p>Instructors let the parents and girls know that while surfing is a fun activity, it is not necessarily easy. Surfing is challenging; it requires determination and adapting to the ever-changing ocean conditions and elements. Campers are going to learn the essentials of surfing and work hard every day. We believe that the ocean and surfing in particular is a place to meet and overcome challenges, tap into personal strength, and experience the rewards of perseverance.</p>

<p>The surf camp offers financial aid for in-need families and operates only through community support in terms of financial contributions, sponsors, donated sustainable surf goods, volunteer efforts. BWS gladly accepts surf gear or sustainable type donations (a list of needed items is viewable at <a href="http://oceangirlproject.com/" title="http://oceangirlproject.com">http://oceangirlproject.com</a>).</p>

<p>Sponsors for the surf camp include the City and County of Honolulu Lifeguards, surfing icon and artist Jeannie Chesser, pro surfer and founder of Aloha Surf Clinics auntie Nancy Emerson, Surfrider Foundation Oahu, Reef Watch Waikiki, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii (B.E.A.C.H.), Surf Garage surf shop, Lions Coffee, Faith Surf School surf legends Tammy and Tony Moniz, Surf Tech, sustainable surfer Heather Brown, Donna Welch Photography, Umeke Market, Diamond Head Market and Grill and employees, Che Pasta, Origami Whale Project, and more.

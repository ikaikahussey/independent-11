<p>MANOA&#8212;It&#8217;s “Manoa Make-A-Difference Day” this Saturday, October 2.</p>

<p>The event is coordinated by the City and County of Honolulu’s Storm Water Quality Branch within the Department of Environmental Services (ENV).</p>

<p>The day will focus on removing trash, pulling weeds, and planting vegetation along Manoa Stream at three separate sites: Kolomono Ditch; Old Waialae and Koali areas; and Woodlawn Bridge. Volunteers can check-in at 8:00 a.m. at the first two sites and 10:00 a.m. at Woodlawn Bridge. The work will take approximately two hours at each location.&nbsp; ENV will also provide educational material on reducing trash.</p>

<p>ENV&#8212;in partnering with numerous businesses, schools, public officials, the State, and military&#8212;will provide supplies. Volunteers will need to sign a release form at check-in. Participants should bring water, wear a hat, old shoes, sunscreen, and dress to get dirty.</p>

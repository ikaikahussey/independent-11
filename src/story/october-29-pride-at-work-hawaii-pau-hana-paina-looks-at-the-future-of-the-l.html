<p>Pride at Work Hawaii is holding a pau hana paina on Friday, October 29 from 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.</p>

<p>The topic on hand is envisioning a queer, worker-friendly America, and queering the American dream. What would good jobs and a healthy community look like for LGBT and other workers in Hawaii? As middle class jobs disappear, &#8220;productivity&#8221; increases fail to trickle down, income inequality grows, and elected representatives fail to lead leaving workers in Hawaii feeling the pinch. For LGBT workers, this ongoing crisis raises questions of optimism and hope. What can we, as a community, dream? What kinds of politics, economy, and companionship can or should we desire?</p>

<p>There will be free pupus and lively discussion in a relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. All are welcome. </p>

<p>The purpose of Pride At Work Hawaii is to mobilize support between the labor movement and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) communities. The non-profit seeks full equality of all workers, including greater openness and dignity. Pride at Work Hawaii opposes all forms of discrimination on the job based on sex, gender, race, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, disability, religion, political views, weight, and height.</p>

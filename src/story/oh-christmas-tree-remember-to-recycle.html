<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) is reminding residents to recycle their Christmas trees after the holidays.</p>

<p>Households with City collection should place bare trees&#8212;without flocking, ornaments, and tinsel&#8212;curbside as part of your normal green waste pickup.<br />
The City provides curbside green waste collection to more than 160,000 homes on Oahu.&nbsp; For those with green carts, trim and cut trees to fit inside the cart with the lid closed.</p>

<p>For households on a manual collection route, cut the tree into lengths up to three feet, then bundle and place the lengths at the curb on your refuse day. If cutting the tree is not possible, residents can drop trees off whole at the nearest Refuse Convenience Center.</p>

<p>For condo residents, trees may be dropped off at any refuse convenience center or directly to the composting facility&#8212;there is no tip fee charged for Christmas trees over the holidays, courtesy of the City.</p>

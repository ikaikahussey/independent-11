<p>KANEOHE&#8212;You may have noticed that <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> uses traditional ahupua‘a place names, where feasible, to demarcate and organize our community-based reporting. These names are sometimes in general use – such as Kaneohe or Kailua – but their boundaries may not be widely known.</p>

<p>Enter the Boundary Marker Project.</p>

<p>Spearheaded by the Ko‘olaupoko Hawaiian Civic Club, and partially funded by the state Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the project will place signage to mark the boundaries of each of the 11 ahupua‘a in the district of Ko‘olaupoko&#8212;Kualoa, Hakipu‘u, Waikane, Waiahole, Ka‘alaea, Waihe‘e, Kahalu‘u, He‘eia, Kane‘ohe, Kailua and Waimanalo.</p>

<p>The boundaries would indicate, for example, that Windward Mall isn&#8217;t in Kane‘ohe at all – it&#8217;s in He‘eia. And that Hawaii Kai is actually part of Ko‘olaupoko!</p>

<p>Club president Mahealani Cypher said that the club plans to work with the neighborhood boards and civic clubs from Ko`olaupoko, and with the state and county transportation departments, on the project.</p>

<p>The grant matches earlier funding from the Harold Castle Foundation, and will be awarded through the club&#8217;s fiscal sponsor, Hawai‘i Maoli, a 501(c)3 non-profit that provides tax-exempt support to native Hawaiian organizations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our goal is to educate each community as to where their ahupua`a boundaries lie, with the ultimate objective to connect everyone with the `aina in which they live,&#8221; Cypher said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are pleased and gratified that OHA has recognized the importance of these projects, all of which will serve to enlighten and uplift the people of Ko`olaupoko,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The club is developing a second phase to this project, in which they will hire teams of outreach educators that will include kupuna and youth from each ahupua‘a who will teach community members about natural and cultural resources and Hawaiian sustainability practices.</p>

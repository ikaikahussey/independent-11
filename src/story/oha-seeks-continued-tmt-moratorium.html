<p>The Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees met on April 10 to discuss the matter of Mauna Kea and the planned thirty-meter telescope (TMT). The board says it plans to &#8220;gain greater clarity on the pending legal cases relating to the TMT project,&#8221; and that &#8220;the board will also review OHAâ€™s past positions on these cases. With that information, the Board will consider its position on the matter at an upcoming board meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While a formal board vote has not been taken yet on the matter, OHA&#8217;s highest leadership involved in the discussions with state officials have sought and continue to seek a continued moratorium,&#8221; said Kehaunani Abad, OHA&#8217;s community engagement director.</p>

<p>Activists have been blocking the access road to the construction site in order to prevent construction from beginning. More than thirty people were arrested by Hawaii County police on Thursday, April 2, but the demonstrations only grew last week, especially as hundreds of Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners, dancers and spectators gathered on Hawaii island for the Merrie Monarch hula festival. </p>

<p>During the past week, OHA leaders have also been in discussions with state decision makers. In these talks, OHA leaders have emphasized the need for all parties to address the unresolved legal matters while the TMT construction moratorium remains in place.</p>

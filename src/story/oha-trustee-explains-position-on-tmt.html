<p>Last week <em>The Independent</em> <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/oha-backs-down-from-contesting-the-tmt-sublease">reported</a> that Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) trustees heard public testimony regarding the agency&#8217;s potential role as a plaintiff in a contested case hearing regarding the proposed Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) sublease between the University of Hawaii and the TMT Corporation. After testimony was heard, the trustees went into executive session for the remainder of the day. Sources informed the <em>Independent</em> later that day that the trustees has decided the agency would not pursue its role as a plaintiff.</p>

<p><em>The Independent</em> sent an inquiry to OHA asking why the trustees changed their minds about the contested case hearing. Hawai‘i Island Trustee Robert Lindsey replied with the following statement explaining his major role in the decision:</p>

<blockquote><p>On July 15 the OHA Board met in executive session to deliberate as to whether OHA should be a plaintiff in a ‘contested case,’ the focus being the rent amount to be paid to OHA via the TMT project. As the Trustee for Hawai‘i Island, I strongly opposed participating in such a ‘contested case’ and take full kuleana for influencing the outcome in closed session. </p>

<p>Prior to the July 15th executive session several folks spoke under Community Concerns in opposition to and in support of OHA’s participation in such an action. Both sides spoke very passionately about their positions. The majority who spoke that morning spoke in opposition. My action reflected the will of that majority. That majority voice reflected what I have always believed to be the majority will of our Hawaiian community in particular and the will of the broader community on Hawai’i Island since I became a Trustee in 2007. Plus, there already has been a ‘contested case’ on the TMT in Third Circuit Court. The case was dismissed. In my view OHA would be throwing good resources after bad. </p>

<p>As a servant leader there are moments when I have to make tough decisions. For me, this was one of those few times. I have family and friends who stand on both sides of the issue. I was compelled to make a call. And I did. I just hope in my na’au that it was a pono call. If it wasn&#8217;t, Poliahu and all the other deities of Mauna a Wakea, I’m sure, will call me on it.</p>

<p>CHINATOWN &#8212; Oil in the Alley, Hawaii’s only all improvised rock band, performs at The Venue of Friday, September 23, as part of the annual <a href="http://www.improvaganza.com/" target="_blank">Improvaganza!</a> festival, a celebration of the art of improv comedy that will feature a host of groups from Hawaii and the U.S. Opening the show on Friday will be Honolulu’s Chocolate Squirrel and Crayons! from Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Oil in the Alley will perform “electric” for the first time in its illustrious history, which includes alleged supporting gigs with the Rolling Stones. The chemistry between R. Kevin Doyle and Sean O’Malley is already electric, and for this first-time performance, they will be joined by Brian Smith on bass guitar and Eric Folk of Family Dinner on drums.</p>

<p>Running from September 22-24, Improvaganza offers a number of shows at a variety of venues, as well as improv comedy workshops. Visit <a href="http://www.improvaganza.com/" target="_blank">www.improvaganza.com</a> for a list of performers, showtimes, and tickets.</p>

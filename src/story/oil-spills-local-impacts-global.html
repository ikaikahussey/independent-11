<p>BOSTON — Among the problems with oil spills is that they don&#8217;t recognize international boundaries.</p>

<p>In the words of <i>GlobalPost&#8217;s</i> Mort Rosenblum, &#8220;Americans appear to regard the BP calamity as a domestic matter. Yet as details leak out of ignored risks and a gusher left too long unplugged&#8212;<a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/global-green/100603/gulf-of-mexico-oil-spill-response" title="the fury is global.">the fury is global.</a>&#8221; </p>

<p>Indeed. In some places, it is a fury&#8212;like <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/global-green/100603/gulf-of-mexico-oil-spill-response" title="France">France</a>, where Lucky Li’s Vietnamese takeout shop is as good a place as any from which to assess the global mood. Elsewhere, like <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/commerce/100602/oil-drilling" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, it&#8217;s not so much a fury as it is a flurry. And, in <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/global-green/100602/canadians-worry-about-oil-spilling-beaufort-sea" title="Canada">Canada</a>, it&#8217;s more a giant worry.</p>

<p>In Cuba, what&#8217;s bad for the environment at large may have positive economic ramifications. <i>GlobalPost&#8217;s</i> Nick Miroff looks into <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/commerce/100602/oil-drilling" title="Cuba’s untapped offshore reserves">Cuba’s untapped offshore reserves</a>, which are growing increasingly attractive to U.S. oil companies with every barrel gushing into the Gulf.</p>

<p>And it took the BP blowout off America&#8217;s coast to jolt Canadians into considering the fate of their own shores. For months, <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/global-green/100602/canadians-worry-about-oil-spilling-beaufort-sea" title="oil companies were lobbying to relax regulations for offshore drilling">oil companies were lobbying to relax regulations for offshore drilling</a> in the environmentally sensitive Beaufort Sea.</p>

They also rarely speak English — and, as a result, get locked out of cleanup efforts and have trouble filing for lost income.</p>

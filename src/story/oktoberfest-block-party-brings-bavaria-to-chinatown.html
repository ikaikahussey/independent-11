<p>Chinatown will become a smaller version of Bavaria tonight, as an Oktoberfest block party kicks off at Nuuanu Avenue and Hotel Street at 6:00 p.m. </p>

<p>Performing onstage will be Hawaiiâ€™s own country music star Dita Holifield with Red Handed, Doolin Rakes, and Family Dinner with jazz trumpeter DeShannon Higa.</p>

<p>In addition to Bavarian food and beverages, the Oktoberfest block party will also feature a competition of Bavarian athletics, including a keg toss and the chicken dance. </p>

<p>Presented by perennial Chinatown block party ringmaster Tim Bostock, Oktoberfest is one more reason to revel in the explosion of arts and culture in Chinatown. Also, it&#8217;s free.</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> staff snapping photos for 24/7, and maybe even taking part in the Bavarian athletics&#8212;well, at least the eating part.</p>

<p><b>Nuuanu Avenue and Hotel Street<br />
Friday, September 24<br />
From 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.</b></p>

<p>Big Island Rainbow papaya farmers may have to <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/08/16/19710-bill-on-big-island-could-ban-rainbow-papayas/">tear out their trees</a> within 30 months, or face fines and jail time, if a bill making the rounds on the Big Island is enacted. The law, which is expected to be submitted to the Hawaii County Council by council member Brenda Ford, proposes fines of up to $1,000 per day and 30 days in jail for farmers or landowners who are growing genetically modified crops.</p>

<p>Hawaii County Council members can expect to debate dueling bills regarding genetically modified crops the next time they try to tackle the issue. Both Kohala Councilwoman Margaret Wille and South Kona/Ka‘u Councilwoman Brenda Ford are working on their own <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/sections/news/local-news/council-members-introduce-gmo-bills.html">legislation</a> that they plan to introduce shortly.</p>

<p>The debate over genetically modified food is attracting the attention of some of the Big Island’s business leaders. On Monday, two island business groups are <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/sections/news/local-news/gmo-summit-be-held-monday-big-island.html">hosting</a> what they are calling the “Hawaii Island GMO Summit” to allow their members to delve into the controversial issue.</p>

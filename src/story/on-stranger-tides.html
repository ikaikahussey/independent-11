<p>KANEOHE&#8212;Drivers on Kamehameha Highway, in Kaneohe, pulled over to take in the sight of something unusual at Heeia Kea Pier. The ominous <i>Black Pearl</i>, of Disney&#8217;s Pirates Of The Caribbean movies, was docked at the pier yesterday. </p>

<p>Locals and tourists alike gasped and gazed at the swashbuckling action of crew members practicing sword fighting for scenes in the fourth installment of the film series, which has grossed over $2.7 billion worldwide.</p>

<p>Jordan Tamai of Ewa and Kyrie Puaoi of Kahaluu were part of the onlookers who drove out to Kaneohe in hopes of catching a glimpse of series headliner Johnny Depp. The actor, however, was not to be found.</p>

<p>Depp will return to his role as the bumbling Captain Jack Sparrow in <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</i>, which began shooting this summer on Oahu and Kauai and be released in 2011. The film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Rob Marshall.</p>

<p>Previous leads Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley won&#8217;t be joining Depp this time around to reprise their roles as the love struck Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. The actors said they thought the Will/Elizabeth storyline went as far as it could.</p>

<p>Depp will instead be joined by a host of big names who are new to the series, including Penelope Cruz as Angelica, a mysterious woman from Captain Sparrow&#8217;s past, and English Actor Ian McShane as the legendary pirate Blackbeard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always sought out the most extraordinary and exotic locations ... Hawaii provides an amazing range of both land and seascapes, and we&#8217;re delighted to return for <i>On Stranger Tides,</i>&#8221; Bruckheimer said in a statement.</p>

<p>Small portions of the third installment in the series <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#8217;s End,</i> were shot on Maui and Molokai.</p>

<p>Gov. Linda Lingle estimated the production will generate $85 million in spending in Hawaii, which is reeling from the steep drop-off in tourism stemming from the global economic crisis.</p>

<p>KANEOHE&#8212;It was her passion for the poor that took her on a humanitarian mission halfway around the world to Africa, where nearly 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Nina Wurlitzer of Kaneohe returned in June from the Iris Ministry orphanage in Mozambique. Going there was a step of faith for Wurlitzer, who said: “I felt called to share the Aloha spirit. We arrived at the orphanage at night. I hadn’t seen anything yet, but I knew when I walked on the property, I just knew I loved this place.”</p>

<p>In May, Wurlitzer flew to Washington D.C. on her way to Africa to meet up with other volunteers from all over the world; pastors, doctors, teachers ... All shared the common goal of giving love to some of the poorest children on earth.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://Mozambiqueorphans.org" title="Mozambiqueorphans.org">Mozambiqueorphans.org</a>, “It is difficult to express the scope of the orphan challenge in Mozambique and much of the rest of Africa. In sub-Sahara Africa alone, there are 43 million orphans.”</p>

<p>Wurlitzer is no stranger to poverty stricken countries. Her compassion for the poor was ignited when she took a trip to Indonesia after graduating from Kalaheo High School in 2004. Since then, she has traveled to Bali, Java, Sumatra, Mexico, New Caledonia, Japan, and Fiji. </p>

<p>The challenge of funding these trips has been met by Wurlitzer’s determination and belief in God’s provision. She worked and saved her paychecks, held fundraisers, and sought donations as well as took out loans. “Jesus said it is better to give than to receive,&#8221; Wurlitzer said. &#8220;When I am blessed, it is so I can bless others.”</p>

<p>At age 25, the petite &#8220;surfer girl&#8221; enjoys outdoor activities and being an active member on the music worship team at Mt. View Community Church in Kaneohe. She is a graduate of Windward Community College and Hawaii Pacific University, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in International Studies in the fall of 2009.</p>

<p>She currently works as a skills trainer for autistic children. This training came in handy at the orphanage, which provides for the needs of 300 to 500 children. Wurlitzer said she relied on her knowledge and faith in God as she helped to feed orphans, assist with medical care, and provide what she referred to as “bush ministry” in the villages and local prison.</p>

<p>Mozambique remains one of the most underdeveloped countries in the world. The country has been ravaged by civil war, poverty, famine, and disease. Recent figures from Mozambiqueorphans.org show 16 percent of all Mozambican children are orphans.</p>

<p>Wurlitzer was also able to lend a hand at a construction site for a restaurant being built for the purpose of providing jobs to orphans who have reached the age of 16 and older. “I am so moved by this orphanage and what God’s doing there. I’m going back,” Wurlitzer said.</p>

<p>Amidst the challenges and harsh surroundings, Wurlitzer said: “Sometimes I found myself thinking, ‘What am I doing here?&nbsp; I’m just a little girl from Kaneohe! But God showed me I was to go back for the kids and to learn love. It’s my desire to give what I have even if it’s nothing but the Aloha spirit&#8212;Even in Mozambique they get the Aloha spirit.”</p>

<p>Wurlitzer plans to return in October of this year to attend the Iris Harvest School of Missions.</p>

<p>“I’ll be selling my car, doing fundraisers, and I have set up a donation web site in order to fund my trip back,&#8221; Wurlitzer said. &#8220;I appreciate everyone’s support.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In celebration of Children and Youth Day, One Voice for Hawaii’s Children (OVHC) is hosting a forum with Hawaii&#8217;s gubernatorial candidates to discuss issues, policies, and challenges related to families and education. Candidates will be asked questions regarding recent issues affecting Hawaii’s keiki, including child care subsidy cuts and a new change in the law regarding age requirements for kindergarteners.&nbsp; Come 2013, approximately 5,300 children will be in limbo and unable to begin kindergarten, according to OVHC. </p>

<p>There will also be an opportunity for families attending the forum to meet and ask questions of the candidates.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The event will kickoff the grassroots “Be My Voice” petition campaign urging citizens to speak up for our children’s best interests. By signing the petition, the public will acknowledge the need to invest in our children, making their success a top priority in Hawaii. The petition can be found at <a href="http://www.BeMyVoiceHawaii.org" title="www.BeMyVoiceHawaii.org">www.BeMyVoiceHawaii.org</a>. </p>

<p>“The path to success starts young,&#8221; said Jean Johnson, president of the Good Beginnings Alliance Board of Directors and OVHC member. &#8220;We are hoping everyone joins the ‘Be My Voice’ grassroots mobilization campaign to help Hawaii’s keiki succeed. Every child needs a voice and by speaking out at this Sunday’s Governor Forum, we can make a collective difference for the future of our state.” </p>

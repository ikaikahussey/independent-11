<p>One Voice Publications is currently working with the Aikau Family and The Eddie Aikau Foundation to develop a bilingual Hawaiian/English chapter-book for students and other readers. The book will be written at the 3rd grade reading level and the story will revolve around the legendary lifeguard, surfer, musician and Polynesian voyager Edward Ryon Makuahanai “Eddie” Aikau. The book is scheduled to be launched in the next few months. </p>

<p>Twenty percent of all sales will go to support charitable projects of the Eddie Aikau Foundation and a portion of the proceeds will also support hula kahiko and the traditional dances of the Pacific region.</p>

<p>The author is Jonathan A. Ibanez, an 8th grade student at St. Anthony’s Junior-Senior High School in Wailuku, Maui. He was one of the 2010 7th grade winners of the annual Eddie Aikau Essay Contest. Partnering with Jonathan to illustrate the book is Hawaii Island artist Henani Enos. Mr. Enos is a Hawaiian language immersion kumu in Keaau and voyager with the Hokualakai docked at Hilo harbor.</p>

<p>This locally produced book about Eddie Aikau will be an illustrated bilingual 96-page paperback chapter-book created with the elementary school student and struggling reader in mind, many who are learning English as a second language.</p>

<p>Project Sponsorship opportunities are available prior to printing. The name of the business, organization, family, or individual sponsoring books will be listed as a “Project Sponsor” in all copies of the published book. The regularly-priced $9.95 book is available for sponsorship or purchase, now through October 15, 2010 at the following discounted price ($5.56) levels:</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Duke Kahanamoku is widely regarded as Hawaii’s greatest athlete, winning six Olympic medals, including three gold medals in swimming, from 1912-1932. Revered worldwide for his exploits, Duke is recognized as the “Father of International Surfing” and later in life was honored with the distinction of being named as Hawaii’s official “Ambassador of Aloha.” As part of keeping that legacy alive, The Outrigger Duke Kahanamoku Foundation (ODKF) awards scholarships and grants to Hawaii students and nonprofits who contribute to enriching the islands sense of aloha and pave the future for Hawaii&#8217;s youth. </p>

<p>This year, ODKF announced the awarding of $155,000 in college scholarships and grants to 92 Hawaii athletes and nonprofit organizations participating in water sports and volleyball.</p>

<p>“These exceptional student-athletes and dedicated nonprofit organizations have earned our support and we are very proud to help be a part of their continued success in academics and athletics in memory of the legendary Duke Kahanamoku,” ODKF President Tim Guard said.</p>

<p>ODKF awarded $109,000 in college scholarships for the 2010-2011 school year to 53 Hawaii residents, who &#8220;reflect the diversity of ODKF’s support for Hawaii’s scholar-athletes statewide.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following is a breakdown of the scholarship recipients: 31 women, 22 men; 23 public school graduates, 30 private school graduates; 36 from Oahu, 7 from Hawaii Island, 5 from Maui, 4 from Kauai, 1 from Molokai; 35 first-time awardees, 18 returning awardees; 39 attending mainland colleges, 14 attending Hawaii colleges.</p>

<p>Highlighting the scholarship awardees is Tyler Amina of Kamehameha Schools, winner of the annual $10,000 Duke Kahanamoku Ambassador of Aloha Scholarship. Tyler will be enrolling in Princeton University this fall to study medicine and play on the school’s water polo team. Among his accomplishments are co-authoring a research paper on the neuropathology of HIV-1 associated dementia.</p>

<p>ODKF created the Ambassador of Aloha Scholarship to reward an exceptional college-bound Hawaii high school senior who embodies the spirit of aloha and character that made Duke Kahanamoku such a beloved figure worldwide.</p>

<p>The foundation also announced awards totaling $46,000 that have been presented to 39 grantees comprised of Hawaii athletes competing in water sports and volleyball events, and nonprofit organizations providing water sports and character development programs for Hawaii’s youth. </p>

<p>Organizations earning grants from ODKF include: AccesSurf Hawaii, Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii, Rainbow Aquatics Swim Team, and the Hawaii National Guard Youth Challenge Academy. </p>

<p>ODKF is a public, nonprofit foundation whose mission is to financially support the development of individuals and organizations that perpetuate the spirit and legacy of Duke Kahanamoku.

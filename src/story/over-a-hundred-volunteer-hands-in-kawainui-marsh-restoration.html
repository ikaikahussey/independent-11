<p>HONOLULU&#8212;More than 100 volunteers from Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO), under the direction of &#8220;Doc&#8221; Burrows, cleared invasive plants, removed tree trimmings, and planted native plants in an effort to help restore the native wetland bird habitat at <a href="http://www.kawainuimarsh.com/Site%20Folder/index.html" target="_blank">Kawainui Marsh</a>.</p>

<p>Kawainui Marsh is the largest remaining wetland in Hawaii and encompasses about 830 acres of land in Kailua. It is an area of cultural and archeological significance, a habitat for endangered species and introduced wildlife, and a critical flood control basin.</p>

<p>HECO volunteers also worked in the lo&#8217;i kalo and weeded the area around the Ulupo Heiau.</p>

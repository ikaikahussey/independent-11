<p>Discussions about eco-poetics often involve nostalgia. The word itself has a fascinating <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=nostalgia&amp;searchmode=none">etymology</a>: from the Greek <em>algos</em> (pain, grief, distress) and <em>nostos</em> (homecoming). The word further descends from Proto-Indo-European <em>nes-</em> (to return safely home), which is cognate with Old Norse nest (food for a journey) and Gothic <em>ganisan</em> (to heal). </p>

<p>From the 17th to 19th centuries, nostalgia was considered a wound and a serious disease afflicting people who had been taken from their homes and families by colonization, war, enslavement, industrialization and globalization. These massive displacements not only separated peoples from their native countries, but also separated them from the natural environment, since many migrations arced towards urban centers. Climate change has increased this kind of migration. </p>

<p>Another term, solastalgia (combining solace, desolation, and nostalgia) speaks to the pain and distress caused when your homeland is destroyed but you are not necessarily displaced. In other words, you yearn for what your home was before it was desecrated by mining, logging, fracking, military testing, or oil spills; it is “<a href="http://theconversation.com/the-age-of-solastalgia-8337">the homesickness you have when you are still at home.</a>” Sadly, solastalgia is becoming more and more common, especially for peoples of color and those in developing countries. </p>

<p>Eco-Poetry is one expressive form through which people have addressed the pain, grief and trauma associated with nostalgia and solastalgia. In these poems, the natural world is longed for because of its association with home, innocence, family, peace, sustenance and nurturance. </p>

<p>Thus the first poetry prompt for our eco-poetics course was related to nostalgia: write about a childhood memory in which you felt connected to nature. Below you will find 8 poems from students in the course (about 15 minutes of reading time). What do you notice about how nostalgia and the environment are portrayed? What do you notice about the forms, images, symbols and other poetic techniques? What emotions do these poems conjure? </p>

<p>Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comment field, and—if you have time—try writing your own poem based on the prompt. </p>

<strong>Environmental Encroachments</strong><br />
Chase Wiggins</p>

<p>I remember:<br />
Sitting at the top of the stairs,<br />
Which used to be on one side of the house<br />
Going down and around to the back yard.<br />
A favorite spot.</p>

<p>We had fruit then:<br />
Papaya, Banana, Starfruit;<br />
Lychee from the tree that now stands barren by the garage.<br />
And flowers: Orchids and Bougainvillea mostly.<br />
Grandma always loved those best.</p>

<p>I remember being young. Small.<br />
Small enough to fit on Papa’s lap<br />
Together on the old bench in the yard— <br />
Tree turned to seat lost to dry rot.<br />
Small enough that the yard was a jungle to explore.</p>

<p>Today we have more house — an extension.<br />
Less yard — an encroachment.<br />
What’s left is mostly rocks and dirt.<br />
A few scattered succulents.<br />
One creeping monstrosity.</p>

<p>Still I remember:<br />
Sitting with Papa in the yard<br />
Gazing across luscious greens<br />
And fewer, scattered houses<br />
Until they all gave way to ocean blue.</p>

<p>As sudden sirens shatter the silence,<br />
I looked up to say “I hope it isn’t serious,”<br />
And we stopped together and prayed.<br />
I don’t remember what exactly we prayed for,<br />
But I am certain now it was serious.</p>

<strong>My Room</strong><br />
Darlene Rodrigues</p>

<p>Waimea Valley and on the way to the falls<br />
canopy of green leaves and branches<br />
laughter and spongy moss<br />
damp leaves and rotted roots<br />
wet socks and cold juice<br />
soaked shoes and slippery steps<br />
mud on your shorts and in your fingers<br />
on your hands and dreams of tiny legs and nibbles on your toes<br />
scampering in the icy water and stream rush of bubbles<br />
childhood revelry and summer fun friends shouting<br />
I got one and Aww it got away<br />
and teachers yelling <br />
Hurry up get back on the trail and We going miss da bus<br />
sometimes itʻs gray skies and mostly not<br />
summer blue of hot humid air and billowy clouds<br />
splashes everywhere and wet palm prints<br />
silken moss and debris on your shins<br />
your cheeks and didn’t mean to fall in<br />
never mean to do any of it and only deliberate thing is<br />
clasped hands underwater and grasping for a flash of gray scurrying</p>

<p>under rocks and to be the scurried<br />
the hidden under the dark shadows<br />
living in the rush of clear water<br />
huddle in a wisp of pond or stream<br />
giants loom over you<br />
murking the water with every step or fall<br />
live the life of catch and release<br />
of spawn and egg to escape<br />
a certain pot of boiled water<br />
kiss the green bloom on the rock<br />
a bite here, a nibble there<br />
to never think of the larger shadows<br />
torpedo shaped propellers slashing in the air<br />
waiting for creaks and oil drips<br />
what do/will they think of next<br />
where does it go or matter<br />
to miniscule me and the<br />
human children wading in<br />
drying puddles who never seek<br />
to live like me undisturbed<br />
under stream rocks<br />
they yearn for the sun, capture the light<br />
and energy of the room<br />
my room of river beds and<br />
mossy rooted pohaku</p>

<p><strong>remembering shade</strong><br />
L. Kava</p>

<p>I remember sitting on the brown leather Lay-Z-boy recliner<br />
in the clutter and the shade of the Lionel Court house –<br />
it might be early morning sun failing <br />
to filter from the one kitchen window <br />
that looked heavy-lidded onto the close white lattice covered passage <br />
from the half-moon wood white gate and the red brown zig-zag brick path <br />
my brothers built<br />
impatiently digging in uncovered summer heat<br />
when I was only just tall enough to walk</p>

<p>The one kitchen side window is only a frame <br />
for shade and trees and occasional roses my mother planted heavily <br />
since she never wanted anyone looking in<br />
at the dark clutter and shade covering me <br />
sitting on the leather Lay-Z-boy chair –<br />
it might be the late afternoon shade <br />
chipping over patio bricks and white wood and wisteria shade <br />
that my mother waited for<br />
because she wanted our cover beautiful <br />
with white and purple and bricks and paint</p>

<p>You couldn’t walk in the backyard <br />
so much as stand, and it wasn’t a yard <br />
so much as “the back” <br />
that was quiet so much as to make a little kid <br />
with too much imagination <br />
silent under shade and smell of cold hose water<br />
trickling between vines, rotting fruit, hot bricks and hanging<br />
flowers that stood still<br />
just letting the sun filter <br />
occasionally touching the dark shade and clutter<br />
of the little room to move inside the house<br />
where I would sit on cool leather<br />
waiting to go to school, waiting to play <br />
outside uncluttered in an open park<br />
waiting to move <br />
away</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure even if they’ve cut down <br />
all the trees my mother constructed and dug up <br />
all the bricks my brothers planted<br />
and ripped off all the wisteria shade<br />
you would still find yourself <br />
still<br />
in that place<br />
waiting to move out from beneath <br />
an imaginary shade</p>

<strong>The Perfect Night to Fly a Kite</strong><br />
Brian Lieu</p>

<p>Dragged by a rope across sharp blades. I don’t see anything. Whispers and screams race from the shadows before me. I flop and plop around as my captors pick up speed. The cool breeze purrs, brushing up on me. I begin to float in the wind. The screams turn to laughter. They echo behind the veil of the night sky. I float higher. What happened to the blades? Am I in heaven? No. I don’t feel any clouds. I float higher. It’s still dark, but now there are handfuls of twinkling stars dotted across the unknown. I float higher. I glide faster. I feel colder. The rushing of the wind across my limbs deafen me to all other sounds—making my skin flap around and tingle. I float higher. Stop. I don’t float higher. The string is taut. My arms split. I drift down to the earth and relax on the familiar sharp grass. Silence. He picks me up by my sticks and drops me into the cold metal bin. I am left alone with the ringing sound of a single woo-hoo. </p>

<p><strong>View</strong><br />
Jessie Lathrop</p>

<p><br />
My fondest memory sits on a roof in Mānoa as a kid. <br />
It looks back at me now and then from the middle <br />
of that synthetic ridge—chin low, arms hugging knees—<br />
years away, when our house came with my father’s then-job <br />
and we lived on the grounds of the Baptist student dorm <br />
and their rec center sat down the hill from our home, low <br />
enough that the roof met the backyard four feet up. I hopped <br />
atop every evening to sit with the sunset. Silver dirt clung <br />
to my hands and legs from my slanted slate perch <br />
and traffic brayed from University Avenue below and <br />
the Honolulu skyline obscured most of my view <br />
of the Pacific, but behind me hung rain on the greenwet <br />
valley mountains, shower trees standing sentinel, and the sun <br />
peeled the light blue off the sky leaving cotton candy tears <br />
toward the horizon and the city turned on for the night <br />
too bright for stars though you could feel them there <br />
in the dim as if earth would ever still be itself no <br />
matter how human stood in the way.</p>

<p><strong>A Nationality of Time</strong><br />
Henry Wei Leung</p>

<p><br />
Ice in the lungs, sunlight like a shattering. </p>

<p>The pond, frozen, and fall’s leaves standing in it at half-mast. </p>

<p>Clover mites as the snow melts. </p>

<p>Footprints as the snow melts. </p>

<p>Air whipping in the distance like a helicopter’s heaving breaths. </p>

<p>Geese, and their goslings, as the snow melts. </p>

<p>A man arrives. </p>

<p>He dangles from the low branch of a tree recently freed of a white burden. </p>

<p>The branch breaks. </p>

<p>He looks behind him before shuffling away. </p>

<p>The next day, the branch is hauled to the edge of the woods. </p>

<p>The next day, the tree is reduced to stump, circular and fallow.</p>

<p>All the snow, now, evaporated into something else.</p>

<p>And I remain, asking nothing in my stillness.</p>

<p>Asking nothing, yet still taking.</p>

<p>I take, and I take.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Off the Boardwalk</strong><br />
Eileen Nalley</p>

<p>Amidst the deluge of<br />
drops raining down<br />
I peer out of a<br />
palmetto thatch hut,</p>

<p>shift my weight around <br />
on the spongy earth<br />
breathing deeply<br />
from the saturated sky,</p>

<p>and when the leaf litter<br />
stops floating<br />
I venture into the mist <br />
to survey the scene.</p>

<p>Slurping from a replenished<br />
elephant ear funnel<br />
I bristle with pride at my <br />
newest survival skill</p>

<p>as the refreshed cicadas<br />
resume their fais do do,<br />
springing on spindly legs<br />
and sloshily keeping time</p>

<p>while lazy rays of afternoon<br />
sun peek through <br />
bright green leaves<br />
warming my watery haven.</p>

<p>In this damp world<br />
I am part of a steamy<br />
oasis for prehistoric <br />
and forgotten creatures,</p>

<p>but today, I got to<br />
step off the boardwalk<br />
and nobody worried <br />
about water moccasins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Modjeska</strong><br />
Elan Stopnitzky</p>

<p>A short distance to the east, the sprawling suburbs of Orange County are dissolved in the undulating foothills of the Santa Ana mountains. The place is a familiar one; I have come here annually to spend my birthdays, catching tadpoles and looking for waterfalls that maybe don&#8217;t exist. We park the car and make our way to the trail-head. The air is hot and dusty, but this is forgiven, for it is perfumed with the aroma of sagebrush. The tiny bones in my ear, usually preoccupied with the inner workings of distant machines, now sing about the flight of insects. We climb a ridge and descend the slope of the far side, in a gully whose red earth bursts open in tangles of tree roots. At the bottom is our destination: a dry riverbed snaking its way through a limitless canyon. Eventually the sand permits a trickle of water, and before long it transforms, droplet by droplet, into a gushing torrent. The electric buzz of insects softens into the murmuring of whitewater, the coarse shrubs of the chaparral exchanged for the delicate beauty of ferns and the velvet of moss. Even the golden light of the sun must be pacified on its way to my skin, cooled to a green as it makes its way through the canopy of sycamore and oak. The trail itself becomes one with the stream, and we scramble through deep blue pools and over polished granite boulders, until the slanting light tells us it is time to return home.</p>

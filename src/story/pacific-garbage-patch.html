<p>There is a false island lost mid-pacific<br />
an Armageddon prophet<br />
carrying plastic in its back pocket<br />
holding our unwanted on a mother’s meridian. </p>

<p>Between 135 degrees east to 155 degrees east<br />
from 35 degrees north to 42 degrees north<br />
you will find this swirling gyre grabbing garbage<br />
into an infinite spiral of toxic waste 25 times bigger<br />
then a Hawaiian island state <br />
because in the middle <br />
mother earth is gathering our forgotten. <br />
Our too old/ our too faded/ our too tired/ too easily<br />
disposable disintegrated into suspended animation.<br />
We find her over packed with our discarded back handed scraps<br />
and dismiss her so easy as if she owes us<br />
for the trap of our existence <br />
like we deserve more than subsistence<br />
so we fuck her for even hinting <br />
she might resist us and hoard riches <br />
as we slit her skin for our instant benefit. Now our mother <br />
has more in common with a beaten wife<br />
than a giver of lives.</p>

<p>But I don’t think this mother is above revenge.<br />
Because we will swallow <br />
the sole of the shoe we dumped last year<br />
in the fish we eat this week.<br />
So listen to tomorrow’s history laughing arm and arm with earth.<br />
They’re having hydrogen hick-ups<br />
and bellies aching distended with noxious gas.<br />
I’m seeing our wombs filled with trash.<br />
We are creating ourselves barren and<br />
this will be our cosmic punch line.<br />
We will be the hung the hang man and the noose<br />
swinging our mother from an indifferent loop<br />
knotted with difficult truths <br />
we have forgotten how to discover.</p>

<p>But in the northern pacific there is a new country<br />
floating beneath the surface.<br />
It is plastic.<br />
It is lost nets and thrown away dreams.<br />
It is bottle caps and yesterday’s things.<br />
It is a chemical compound backbone we cannot break<br />
only translate into food chains. <br />
Here is our cancer.<br />
We are manufacturing our own tumor<br />
malignant and starving feasting on the flesh of our mother.</p>

<p>Can you hear her whisper -<br />
Sometimes you cannot see below my surface<br />
but I am not bottomless<br />
she says and I listen while I stand<br />
holding a throwaway starbucks cup in my hand. </p>

<p>I sweep my crumbs beneath the table.<br />
I eat more than my share.<br />
And tomorrow I will buy another coffee <br />
in a disposable cup with a polystyrene cap<br />
showing nothing biodegradable about me</p>

<p>while the earth speaks.<br />
I am plastic down to my digestive tract she says.<br />
I am mecury/lead/monoxide/I am poison.<br />
Petroleum lined at the cellular level<br />
confine me in molecular chains.<br />
Gift wrap me in lead.<br />
Embalm my flesh with the dead.<br />
Spit me disposable and I will give you treats<br />
plastic sand beaches and food you cannot feast.<br />
Remember she laughs <br />
You should not have shit where you eat.</p>

<p>Now she watches us bickering over fate.<br />
Wonders if too late we will see our expiration date<br />
filled with too many too much and not enough.<br />
Come she will say let’s come together and listen <br />
to our heart beats <br />
stutter.</p>

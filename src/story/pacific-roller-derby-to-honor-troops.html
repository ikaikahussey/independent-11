<p>KAPOLEI – In honor of the Barber’s Point Naval Air Museum’s Centennial Celebration and the Ten Year Remembrance of September 11, Pacific Roller Derby (Pacific) will host a military-themed ‘Tribute to our Troops’ scrimmage featuring Sailors vs. Soldiers at the US Coast Guard Air Station at Barber’s Point on Saturday, September 17.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The scrimmage begins at 4pm and will feature live action roller derby in the tennis-court ‘cage’ at The Hideaway Club. Many of the league’s participants are directly involved with the armed forces including the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Coast Guard. The roller derby league has become an ‘ohana to many incoming military families by offering a supportive athletic environment for military spouses and active duty members. </p>

<p>Many of the league’s skaters are military wives and have found a close-knit group of friends through New Girl Training, Boot Camp, Derby Middle School, and participation as a skater on the league’s home teams, the Oahu Hula-gans travel team, and the Pacific All-Stars travel team. </p>

<p>Pacific Roller Derby will continue to accept donations of new and gently used school supplies at the scrimmage. Fans are encouraged to bring donations in support of Pacific’s participation in the Hawaii Jaycee’s 4th Annual Adopt A School Day, a statewide grassroots effort to establish awareness and service to Hawaii’s schools.</p>

<p>Non-military fans are required to RSVP at <a href="http://www.pacificrollerderby.com" target="_blank">www.pacificrollerderby.com</a> by midnight on Friday, September 16, to gain access to Coast Guard Air Station for the afternoon event, or be sponsored by an active military duty member.</p>

<p>Scientists with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center acknowledged they overstated the threat on Saturday, February 27 and explained that it was a necessity and that they took the proper steps and learned the lessons of the 2004 Indonesian tsunami that killed thousands of people who didn&#8217;t get enough warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a key point to remember that we cannot under-warn. Failure to warn is not an option for us,&#8221; said Dai Lin Wang, an oceanographer at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jBrcBuf8vcRnbwe8MlMqRV1EnkOwD9E5LFTG1" title="in Associated Press' report">in Associated Press&#8217; report</a>. &#8220;We cannot have a situation that we thought was no problem and then it&#8217;s devastating. That just cannot happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of people fled shorelines for higher ground Saturday in a panic that circled the Pacific Rim after scientists warned 53 nations and territories that a tsunami had been generated by the massive Chilean quake.</p>

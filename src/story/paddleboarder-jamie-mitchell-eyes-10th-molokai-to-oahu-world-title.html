<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Paddleboarder Jamie Mitchell will shoot for a record 10th consecutive Molokai to Oahu Paddleboard World Championship title this Sunday, July 31 when he embarks upon the marathon 32-mile crossing of the Ka Iwi (Molokai) Channel. If he is successful, he will become Quiksilver&#8217;s second 10-time world champion, alongside surfer Kelly Slater.</p>

<p>Mitchell, 34, out of Queensland, Australia, has dominated the international paddleboard scene for a decade, bagging prestigious race titles across several continents. Like his surfing counterpart Slater, Mitchell&#8217;s world domination of his sport has seen him post records that may never be touched. </p>

<p>Mitchell has been in Hawaii acclimatizing and racing for the past two weeks. During that time he has logged victories in the 17-mile Cline Mann race off the shores of Oahu, and the 9-mile Maliko Gulch race off Maui. His final challenge is the Molokai Channel. </p>

<p>As defending champion and course record holder (4h:48m:23s), Mitchell knows that the ocean has the final say. The Molokai Channel is infamous for its tempestuous seas, raging rip-currents, and humid heat, any of which can bring a paddler&#8217;s best intentions undone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to leave it all out on the channel this year,&#8221; says Mitchell. &#8220;The Molokai Channel is my Everest. I&#8217;ve given it 10 years of my life. I&#8217;ve done the preparation, and I&#8217;m looking forward to putting it all to work. The Molokai is one of those races where you can&#8217;t afford to slack off on anything&#8212;hydration, nutrition, the course, your fitness, your equipment. You&#8217;ve got to piece it all together and they need to be right on key on the day.&#8221; </p>

<p>If all goes according to plan, Mitchell will paddle to shore at Maunalua Bay, Hawaii Kai, Oahu, at around 12 noon on Sunday, July 31.</p>

<p>A leading member of the Quiksilver Waterman Collection team, Mitchell is a multi-discipline ocean athlete who also excels in the arenas of big-wave riding, stand-up paddling and surfing, and water safety and life-guarding.</p>

<p>Jamie&#8217;s accomplishments include: United States Paddleboard Champion; XXL Big Wave Paddle-In Nominee; Battle of the Paddle standup paddle champion, California; Hennessey&#8217;s International Paddleboard Champion; 32-mile Catalina Classic Champion; Alternate invitee to the Quiksilver In Memory of Eddie Aikau Big-Wave Invitational, Waimea Bay, Hawaii; Head of water safety for the world&#8217;s top-ranked surfers, Quiksilver Pro New York this September.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Longtime Honolulu rail gadfly and stalwart opponent to the $5 billion project Panos Prevedouros has begun a fundraising campaign in preparation for the launch of his 2012 Honolulu mayoral campaign. </p>

<p>Prevedouros garnered 19 percent of the vote in the 2010 election. The University of Hawaii professor, along with a handful of other rail opponents, has long been stalwart against the rail project in its current form, citing grave concerns over funding and planning issues. Armed with a litany of studies and testimony finding fault with the rail plan, Prevedouros and his anti-rail colleagues have remained vigilant as the project rumbles ahead.</p>

<p>EWA&#8212;With the summer at a close, many club sports seasons are done and the school year has begun. But for a select group of Hawaii&#8217;s youngsters, there will be one last chance to relive this past season’s glories. </p>

<p>On Sunday September 12, the City and County of Honolulu will honor local teams with a “Parade of Champions.” The parade will include the Waipio Little League All-Stars and seven other champion youth sports teams and individuals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everyone is invited to join us for a community parade honoring these fine young athletes and role models,&#8221;&nbsp; said acting Mayor Kirk Caldwell in a statement. &#8220;This is a wonderful chance to show our pride in their achievements and our home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The parade will be held in Waipio-Gentry, the hometown of the Waipio Little League All-Stars who last week won the United States championship title at the Little League World Series.

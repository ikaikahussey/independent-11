<p>Long time Waianae Coast residents Richard and Ursula Robles are the proud new owners of Paradise Isle Kamaaina and Visitor Center at Makaha Marketplace. The Robles, who previously owned Makaha Fashion Boutique, purchased the neighboring space in May 2009 to expand their business.</p>

<p>The store still features affordable fashions for the whole family, and now includes fishing and diving supplies, beach gear and rentals, swimwear, souvenirs, and custom t-shirts, stickers, and banners. </p>

<p>The same-day, low priced, custom t-shirt, sticker and banner service is popular among locals and visitors alike. Customers can create their own designs, and receive the finished product later that day. Paradise Isle does not charge a separate silk screen fee, and will supply the shirts in various styles, from t-shirts, to women&#8217;s spaghetti strap or regular tanks tops, and sweatshirts.</p>

<p>Check out the 50 to 70 percent sale off clothing in stock while supplies last.</p>

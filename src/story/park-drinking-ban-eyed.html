<p><a href="http://www.kauai.gov/Government/OfficeOfTheCountyClerk/CountyCouncil/tabid/88/Default.aspx" title="The Kauai County Council">The Kauai County Council</a> is considering a ban on nighttime drinking in county parks.</p>

<p>The measure, which would ban consumption or possession of an intoxicating liquor between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., has been endorsed by Kauai Police Chief Darryl Perry.</p>

<p>The chief said that drinking in parks has contributed to domestic violence, criminal property damage, and assaults.</p>

<div class="pull-gold">Kauai is the only county in the state that allows drinking in its public parks. A law that banned drinking was allowed to expire in 2001.</div>

<p>Still, in testimony delivered to the Council&#8217;s Parks and Transportation Committee, Perry said the law would be used primarily to crack down on troublemakers, and noted officers would not &#8220;bother&#8221; people who are not bothering others with their drinking, <a href="http://www.kauaiworld.com/articles/2009/09/01/news/kauai_news/doc4a9c9376be43f296053087.txt" title="The Garden Island"><i>The Garden Island</i></a> reported.</p>

<p>The bill would not apply to campers with valid permits.</p>

<p>Kauai is the only county in the state that allows drinking in its public parks. A law that banned drinking was allowed to expire in 2001.</p>

<p>The committee approved the bill, which will now go before the full Council for review.</p>

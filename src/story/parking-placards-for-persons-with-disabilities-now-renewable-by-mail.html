<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The State of Hawaii Disability and Communication Access Board (DCAB) will now process all renewal applications for parking placards for persons with disabilities&#8212;making the renewal process doable by mail now.</p>

<p>“We hope this new service to renew removable windshield placards by mail will be more convenient for people,” said Francine Wai, DCAB executive director. </p>

<p>The renewal by mail service is available to all placard holders statewide. Reminder notices for holders of expiring placards will contain a new application form.&nbsp; The completed application form verifies the disability certification by a licensed physician. The form and a copy of a picture identification card may be returned to the DCAB office in a postage paid envelope that will be sent with the renewal application.</p>

<p>Removable windshield placards are issued to qualified individuals with disabilities when certified by a practicing physician that they have a medical condition that restricts them from walking more than 200 feet without stopping to rest. A vehicle may park in designated accessible parking spaces when displaying a placard or license plate.</p>

<p>Prior to August 1, 2010, qualified persons with disabilities could receive two removable windshield placards valid for four years issued by a county agency or renewed by mail from DCAB. After August 1, 2010, changes to State law allowed only one removable windshield placard to be issued, valid for a period of six years. A person with a disability who is the registered owner of a motor vehicle may request a disabled person’s license plate in lieu of the second windshield placard at the County Department of Motor Vehicle office.</p>

<p>Effective October 1, 2010, all renewals for a removable windshield placards will be conducted by mail. Should a county issuing office or Satellite City Hall receive an application for renewal, the application will be forwarded to the DCAB office for processing. There is no fee transaction for a renewal of a removable windshield placard.</p>

<p>First-time applicants must still apply in person at a County issuing office or Satellite City Hall. The Counties will continue to issue temporary removable windshield placards and replacement placards for a fee, as is the current practice.</p>

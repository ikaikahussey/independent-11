<p><a href="http://pasisahlberg.com/">Pasi Sahlberg</a> is a Finnish educator and scholar. He gave several talks in Honolulu recently, sharing lessons that Hawaii&#8217;s education system can learn from Finland. On his short list: a long time horizon for educational reform efforts; a highly competitive, attractive educational profession (with &#8220;ten times more applicants than we can let in,&#8221; he says); and a highly integrated special-needs education system.</p>

<p>Underlying their efforts since the early 1970s, though, is a Nordic philosophy of social equity, which he discusses in this short cut.</p>

<p>Ikaika Hussey interviewed Mr. Sahlberg at a Waikiki hotel.</p>

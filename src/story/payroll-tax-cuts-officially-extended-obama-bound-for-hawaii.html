<p>HONOLULU&#8212;With Congress finally buckling to White House demands to extend the payroll tax cuts before the new year, President Barack Obama is officially heading &#8220;home&#8221; to Hawaii for the holidays. The President is scheduled to arrive in Honolulu at 6:25 p.m.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of this agreement, every working American will keep his or her tax cut&#8212;about $1,000 for the average family,&#8221; Obama said at a press conference Thursday. &#8220;That’s about $40 in every paycheck. Vital unemployment insurance will continue for millions of Americans who are looking for work.&nbsp; And when Congress returns, I urge them to keep working to reach an agreement that will extend this tax cut and unemployment insurance for all of 2012 without drama or delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Secret Service has already made its presence felt in Kailua, where the President has stayed for the previous two holiday seasons. The rest of the &#8220;first family&#8221; have been in Hawaii since last week. Prior to the delay caused by the deadlock on Capitol Hill, Obama was scheduled to arrive in Honolulu on December 17.</p>

<p>The President plans to return to Washington in early January.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;PBS Hawaii will receive $370,313 to fund equipment upgrades that will allow the station to deliver high definition programming while maximizing signal strength thanks to a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</p>

<p>The money will be spent on the following:</p>

<p>* $294,000 to PBS Hawaii in Honolulu will fund the addition of high-definition (HD) master control equipment, which will enable the station to handle the delivery of PBS HD programming and improve over-the-air and cable distribution. Local terrain issues have a negative impact on over-the-air distribution and most of the viewers receive services via cable.</p>

<p>* $76,313 to PBS Hawaii will fund the purchase and installation of a power upgrade kit for the stationâ€™s transmitter as well as test and monitoring equipment.</p>

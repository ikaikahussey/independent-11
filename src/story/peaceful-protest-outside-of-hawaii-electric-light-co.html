<p>The protest was organized by Puna Pono Alliance, an environmental group opposed to geothermal expansion. Many of the demonstrators wore T-shirts with the group’s logo on the front and “SAVE POHOIKI” on the back. Some had taken part in a three-day march to Hilo starting Saturday from Pahoa High School.</p>

PEARL CITY&#8212;Just a year ago, the Pearl City Chargers were a young football team with a few standouts and a new coach, finishing the season 4-4. This year, the team has already exceeded most expectations marking a 4-0 record and a 3-0 record in OIA White West division. But they&#8217;re not looking to stop there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Under Coach Kai Kamaka, in his second year as head coach, the young men in purple and white are looking to be at the top in the end of the Division II regular season and charge in the playoffs.</p>

<p>The Chargers came away with a 39-21 victory over the Mckinley Tigers, 1-3, last week to remain undefeated in the White Division. Pearl City quarterback Isaac Shim started in place of Dustin Bataya, who is still recovering from an injury suffered during the win over Nanakuli the week before.</p>

<p>Even though play on both sides of the football looked flat during the first half, the Pearl City team put it all together during the second half. Shim had a good showing, throwing for 163 yards and one touchdown. Running back and free safetly Cyrus Coen seemed to avoid the Tiger defense all night rushing for 118 yards and three touchdowns. However, it was the defense that pushed the Chargers to victory. Josiah Demello, who plays both ways, came up big scoring on an 81-yard fumble return in the third quarter and recovering another fumble in the fourth. </p>

<p>This Friday, September 17, Pearl City returns to their home field in a matchup against Kalani High School, who is 0-3. The week following the Kalani game, Pearl City will play at Waialua, 1-3, which has always been a tough competitor. </p>

<p>The prediction for the remainder of the season looks favorable for the Chargers. With an undefeated record to start off, winning five games would ensure a playoff berth as Pearl City will hit the tougher part of its schedule, including games against Kalaheo and Waipahu, the projected OIA white champions.</p>

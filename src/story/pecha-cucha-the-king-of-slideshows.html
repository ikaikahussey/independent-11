<p>Pecha Kucha Night (PKN) was conceived with the intent to provide a forum for young designers and artists to come together, share their work, and meet others engaging in the creative process.&nbsp; Started in 2003 by architects in Tokyo, PKN has since spread to over 215 cities throughout the world.</p>

<p>The evening consists of a series of short presentations. The key to PKNâ€™s success is its patented format of 20 slides per designer, shown for 20 seconds each slide. By limiting each presenter to 6 minutes and 40 seconds of fame, the interest level remains high and the diversity of presenters is increased.</p>

<p>Pecha Kucha Night has satisfied a demand for a social networking event where creative thinkers can gather and informally share their work, discuss the creative process and ultimately inspire others in their community.</p>

<p>To become a presenter, go to <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org" target="_blank">www.pecha-kucha.org</a>, click on &#8220;Honolulu,&#8221; and then send an email using the online form.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;State officials met at Louis Pohl Art Gallery in Chinatown today as part of a walkabout to raise awareness about pedestrian safety.</p>

<p>The month of August has been proclaimed by the State as the first pedestrian safety month in the nation, with related community events and campaigns taking place throughout the month. The goal is to create heightened awareness of safe pedestrian and driver behavior and ultimately save lives by making Hawaii a safer place to walk.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona; Edwin Sniffen, State highways administrator; Sandy Pohl, an arts district advocate for pedestrian safety; and Dianne Ward, spokesperson for Walk Wise Hawaii talked with Downtown pedestrians and business owners about safer driver and pedestrian behavior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hawaii has one of the highest pedestrian fatality rates in the country,&#8221; Aiona said at the safety campaign&#8217;s launch earlier this month. &#8220;While it will take a combination of stricter laws, ongoing education, and various road safety improvements to address this serious problem, we all need to use more caution and courtesy when driving and walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Emotions are still running high with Honolulu residents as police continue to search for a driver<a href="http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/Moiliili-Dangerous-Mid-Block-Crosswalk/44NRWuambkuiXwgtnu2JMA.cspx" title=" involved in a hit-and-run pedestrian accident in Moiliili Sunday afternoon"> involved in a hit-and-run pedestrian accident in Moiliili Sunday afternoon</a> that left a five-year-old girl who was crossing in a crosswalk with serious injuries.</p>

<p>&#8220;The responsibility to improve safety on our streets lies with all of us, both pedestrians and motorists,&#8221; Aiona said. &#8220;Pedestrians need to use caution when crossing the street, while motorist need to be aware of their surroundings and stop for pedestrians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some further motivation to keep you paying attention out on the street: The fine for pedestrians who jaywalk is $70. The fine for drivers who do not stop for pedestrians is $97.</p>

<p>Also good to note: If you&#8217;re already in the crosswalk when the &#8220;don&#8217;t walk&#8221; signal begins to flash, you are not violating the law and should finish crossing the street. The law does not require a motorist to stop for a pedestrian on the sidewalk waiting to cross the street. The pedestrian must be crossing within the crosswalk.</p>

<p>Although the law only pertains to crosswalks, a motorist who does not stop for a jaywalker may be cited for other violations. Section 291C-73(a) says that a pedestrian crossing a roadway at any point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right of way to all vehicles upon the roadway. However, in Section 291C-74 HRS, it says that the driver of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian upon any roadway and shall give warning by sounding the driver&#8217;s horn when necessary and shall exercise proper precaution upon observing any child. </p>

<p>Here are some tips provided by the State for being a safe walker:</p>

<p>* Always walk on the sidewalk. If there is no sidewalk, walk facing traffic.<br />
* Dress to be seen. During the day, wear brightly colored clothing, and at night wear special reflective material on your shoes, hat or clothing.<br />
* Watch for vehicles turning into or backing out of parking spaces or driveways.<br />
* Always cross streets directly and never diagonally.<br />
* Obey all traffic signs and signals.<br />
* When crossing the street, cross only at corners or marked crosswalks. Stop at the curb, or the edge of the road. Look all ways&#8212;left, right, left again, and over your shoulder before you step into the street. If you see a car, wait until it goes by. Then look all ways again until no cars are coming.<br />
* When crossing in front of stopped cars, make eye contact to be sure drivers see you before crossing in front of them.<br />
* Walk. Don’t run.</p>

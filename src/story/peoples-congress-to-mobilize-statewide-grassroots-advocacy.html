<p>Hawai‘i residents face fundamental challenges in an increasingly globalized word: historic wealth inequality and a high cost of living, lack of affordable housing, an education system in crisis, and the sixth highest rate of poverty in the United States. Hawai‘i’s lands and waters are also being put at increasing risk from a variety of outside pressures: local funding for environmental protection is dropping as the climate crisis worsens; streams are diverted for business interests even as the state faces the impending threat of drought. Because Hawai‘i imports 80 percent of its food and much of its energy, residents are vulnerable to high food and energy prices, shortages in basic necessities and unstable job markets. </p>

<p>In the midst of these struggles, a coalition of community advocacy groups spanning the breadth and depth of these issues has convened a summit of sorts for folks from all walks of life in the islands to come together and create an organized voice to try and steer the direction of Hawai‘i&#8217;s wa‘a toward a more equitable and sustainable future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hawai‘i Appleseed is excited to be a part of the People&#8217;s Congress because of its potential to bring together a strong, unified voice to address the most pressing issues facing Hawai‘i,” said Gavin Thornton, Co-Executive Director of the Hawai‘i Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice. “So many of our residents struggle with high housing costs, low wages, inequitable tax burdens and other widespread problems that threaten their ability to achieve economic stability and fulfill their potential. The People&#8217;s Congress can help create a shared vision of a better Hawai‘i and raise the chorus for positive change.”</p>

<p>Cade Watanabe, of Unite Here! Local 5 and Aikea Movement said, “We live in a Hawai`i that today provides less and less opportunity for Hawai‘i’s working families. The People’s Congress is an exciting opportunity for our members to connect, strategize and organize for a better Hawai‘i. It&#8217;s time for us to take back our community.”</p>

<p>A series of community forums was organized with meetings held throughout the Hawaiian archipelago during the months of October and November. Engaged citizens collaborated on establishing which issues ought to be at the forefront of discussion during the Congress, and began the discussion on what possible community-driven solutions might be deployed to address them. The People’s Congress will provide an opportunity to engage in shared movement building and concrete action, build on the work done at the Island Forums, and launch work on a “People’s Agenda:” a political and organizing strategy for lasting positive change in Hawaiʻi.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tiare Lawrence, Project Coordinator for the Hawai‘i Alliance for Progressive Action (HAPA), and also a founder and community organizer for the Aloha `Āina Project, believes that the People’s Congress, “will allow us the opportunity to build partnerships and help us help each other. I believe these partnerships will assist us in achieving our goals for a better Hawai‘i.” </p>

<p>“The People&#8217;s Congress represents cooperative and collaborative work which seeks proactive change for the benefit of the entire community,&#8221; said Moses K.N. Haia, Executive Director for the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation (NHLC). &#8220;For NHLC, this initiative provides a partnership opportunity that will greatly assist with identifying the issues important to members of the larger community as a means of engaging in a collective effort to align those interests with the best interests of the Hawaiian community.”</p>

<p>The head of the Hawai`i “Teachers for Change” Caucus, Mireille Ellsworth, makes clear that, “we want to establish connections with activists on other issues that also affect our students, members and the larger community. Without developing a shared understanding of the need for crosscutting solidarity in action, we will always be easily isolated and defeated.”</p>

<p>Marti Townsend, Director of Sierra Club of Hawai‘i said, “The People’s Congress provides a unique opportunity for us to work together with others of like-mind and mission. The Sierra Club&#8217;s mission is to protect both the natural and human environment. To achieve this mission we need a fair and open government committed to serving the interests of the people, not corporations. We need a system that respects and includes all of us equally.&nbsp; We need a community united in our collective best interest to overcome the oppression and fear that dictates so much of our decision-making today.”</p>

<p>“There are so many good people working on important issues, from protecting our natural resources for future generations, to issues of homelessness, wealth inequality, open government, education and equal rights,” said Anne Frederick, Executive Director of HAPA. “We believe that if we come together through the People’s Congress to identify the barriers we face in common and illuminate the root causes of injustice we all face, that we (and our work) can be more powerful and effective.”</p>

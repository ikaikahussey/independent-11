<p>MAUI&#8212;Kanaha Pond, one of Maui’s most scenic wetlands, is home to the endangered Hawaiian stilt (‘Aeo), Hawaiian coot (Alae-ke‘oke‘o), and Hawaiian duck (Koloa-maoli).</p>

<p>Administrative rule changes by the State Department of Land and Natural Resources make permits no longer a requirement to visit inner sections of the Kanaha Pond wildlife sanctuary, which is open from sunrise to sunset, between August 31 to March 31 annually.</p>

<p>However rules for public visitation remain in place, to keep the sanctuary safe for wildlife, plants, and people. Visitors may walk in to view wildlife, plants, and the wetland vistas, and must remain at all times on the marked roads and trails only. Pets are not allowed.</p>

<p>Entrance signs with rules for visiting are posted at the two entry gates on the ocean side of the sanctuary. One access gate is near the Valley Isle Produce end of the sanctuary. The other gate is just past the tall naupaka hedge, half a mile to the east farther along Amala Place.</p>

<p>No changes have been made for visiting the Observation Kiosk situated off Old Haleakala Highway, and it remains open year-round.</p>

KONA&#8212;Hawaii County&#8217;s &#8220;Twilight&#8221; fans received a treat last weekend from actor Peter Facinelli, who plays Dr. Carlisle Cullen, the father of Edward Cullen in the popular movie series. Facinelli greeted fans with a warm smile and signed autographs, posed in a few pictures, and spoke about the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; series.</p>

<p>On Thursday July 2, rumors surfaced through the KBIG FM Radio Station Facebook page about an unknown character from &#8220;Twilight&#8221; coming out to sign autographs at Makalapua Stadium Cinemas in Kona. <i>Youth News for The Hawaii Independent</i> immediately head out to Kona.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival, the entrance of Makalapua Cinemas was overflowing with people. A security guard working at the Cinema tried to discourage people waiting at the entrance. After introducing ourselves and asking about the &#8220;Twilight&#8221; rumor, she came closer and said, “We don’t know exactly who is coming, but we know that he or she is supposed to come around 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. So wait around till then.”</p>

<p>The <i>Youth News</i> crew was lucky enough to watch the new &#8220;Twilight&#8221; movie <i>Eclipse</i> through the afternoon. Upon leaving the theater, we noticed a black GMC pulling up to Makalapua Cinemas. Peter Facinelli stepped out and made his way toward the entrance. Facinelli signed autographs for roughly an hour, and got back into the car and left.</p>

<p>Many people were ecstatic over Facinelli’s appearance, but the <i>Youth News</i> crew questioned his visit. Why would he show up without the cast of &#8220;Twilight&#8221; and why was he in Hawaii? <i>Youth News</i> set out to find the answers.</p>

<p>According to Stuff.com, Megan Fox and Brian Austin Green were recently married at the Four Seasons Resort on the Hawaii Island. Brian Austin Green, who once starred in <i>Beverly Hills 90210,</i> befriended co-actress Jennie Garth. Garth is married to Peter Facinelli. While the bodyguards prevented anyone from asking questions of the guest of honor, it seems likely that Facinelli was already on the island for the wedding of Fox and Austin Green and agreed to do some promotion for the movie.</p>

<p>When asked about the connection, Crissa Okamura of Mountain View had this to say: “That’s the reason he’s here, because he’s not here for the movie. His [Facinelli] wife [Garth] and Brian Austin Green are really good friends from [Beverly Hills] 90210, so they’re here.”</p>

<p>A &#8220;Twilight&#8221; fan, under the user name &#8220;808Twilighters,&#8221; posted a video on Youtube and shared thoughts of Facinelli’s appearance: “It was great to have Hawaii included in the many Eclipse promotions! I feel like Hawaii fans are really left out of all the many events that [take place], it was nice to be included!”</p>

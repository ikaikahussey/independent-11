<p>Tomorrow, Senator Laura Thielen&#8217;s Water and Land committee, the same committee that recommended against the nomination of developer-lobbyist Carleton Ching to the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) chairmanship, will hold a hearing to determine whether or not to advise and consent to the governor&#8217;s nomination of Bill Balfour to the DLNR&#8217;s Water Commission.</p>

<p>Read an article explaining exactly why this nomination is <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/balfour-strike-two-for-david-ige">even worse</a> than the Ching nomination.</p>

<p>An online petition is gathering signatures to oppose Blafour&#8217;s nomination, and has passed 2,500 signatures. In the time it took to write this post, the number of signatures increased from 2,666 to 2,681 (15 signatures in roughly five minutes). Add your name below:</p>

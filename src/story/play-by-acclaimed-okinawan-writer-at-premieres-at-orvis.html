<p>MANOA&#8212;The Manoa Readers/Theatre Ensemble, a coproduction of the University of Hawaii at Manoa College of Languages, Linguistics, and Literature and UHM Outreach College, will stage the world premiere of Oshiro Tatsuhiro`s <em>The Cocktail Party</em>. The play will be performed free of charge in Honolulu on Thursday, October 27 at 7:30 p.m. in UHM Orvis Auditorium. </p>

<p>Oshiro Tatsuhiro, considered Okinawa&#8217;s foremost living writer, won Japan&#8217;s highest literary award, the Akutagawa Prize, for his novella, <em>The Cocktail Party</em>, in 1967. He was the first Okinawan author to be so honored. <em>The Cocktail Party</em> was rewritten as a play in 1995, and was published for the first time (August 2011) by the University of Hawaii Press and <em>Manoa Journal in Living Spirit: Literature and Resurgence in Okinawa</em>, edited by Katsunori Yamazato and Frank Stewart.</p>

<p><em>The Cocktail Party</em> is about an Okinawan man and his teenaged daughter, and their appeal for justice after an American serviceman sexually attacks her on the eve of the reversion of Okinawa to Japan.</p>

<p>Following the performance, a panel including author Oshiro Tatsuhiro and Living Spirit editors Katsunori Yamazato and Frank Stewart will discuss the issues that arise in the play. </p>

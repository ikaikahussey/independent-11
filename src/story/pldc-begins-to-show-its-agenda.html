<p>On its July 25 board meeting, the PLDC will be asking the <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/organizations/board-of-land-and-natural-resources/">land board</a> to transfer 837.8 acres on the Big Island and O‘ahu to its jurisdiction. That includes 545 acres in the Puako forest in Kohala; 124 acres at Olomana Golf Course in Waimanalo; and 168 acres in Kapolei.</p>

<p>The items are posted in an amended agenda, reprinted here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7. Requests to Land Board</p>

<p>a. Request to Land Board to transfer the development rights for Puako Forest, TMK (3) 6-9-001:015 (545.025 acres) and to begin preliminary discussions with the current lessee, Volcano Island Honey, Co. , regarding a new lease agreement for the entire 545.025 acres which would be more consistent with the South Kohala Community Development Plan.</p>

<p>b. Request to Land Board to transfer the development rights for Olomana Golf Course, TMK (1) 4-1-013:010 and 012 (134.633 acres) and to begin preliminary discussions with the current lessee, Hawaii Golf Properties Inc., regarding a lease ￼extension to facilitate capital improvements to the golf course, as well as adjustments to the current, restrictive fee pricing.</p>

<p>c. Request to Land Board to transfer the development rights for East Kapolei<br />
Parcels, TMKs (1) 9-1-16:08 (31.915 acres), (1) 9-1-17:97 (36.365 acres), (1) 9-1- 18:05 (59.088 acres) and (1) 9-1-18:08 (40.731 acres) and to explore development opportunities for those parcels.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Puako</h2>

<p>Ikeda said that they intend to bring Puako land use in line with the <a href="http://www.hawaiicountycdp.info/south-kohala-cdp/skcdpfinaldraft11.18.08.pdf/at_download/file">&#8220;South Kohala Community Development Plan</a>. That document was very critical of Colony Capital&#8217;s plans to develop a golf course on 500 acres in the forest. Colony Capital is a Los Angeles-based international private equity firm, and the owner of Orchid at Mauna Lani and Hilton Waikoloa resorts.</p>

<p>The South Kohala Community Development Plan also emphasized opportunities for food (i.e, Volcano Island Honey) and kiawe production. </p>

<p>&#8220;Kiawe wood can be sold as firewood or other related products such as kiawe flour, honey, and artisan wood could be provided,&#8221; the plan said. </p>

<p>&#8220;Money earned from the sale of kiawe wood could go back into the management of the forest.&#8221;</p>

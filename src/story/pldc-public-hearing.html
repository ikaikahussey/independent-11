<p>At first I thought to put this together as a complete article, but I believe you are only looking for input, that someone else will write the article.</p>

<p>These are comments by various speakers:</p>

<p>One public citizen asked why there a public meeting without the other members in attendance. The answer was that a public hearing doesn’t require the board of directors to be here.</p>

<p>From Z. ‘aki:&nbsp; Our future generatons of Hawaii…are they going to look back at this block of concrete and be angry at us for not stopping [this]. I would like to affirm that the pldc be abolished for the betterment of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Bob Loy said the PLDC is an agency that is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>Brandy Hyeden: What the pldc can do is quite frankly scary. The vagueness of this act is frightening. There is no accountability. They are going to take away our ability to say what we want in Hawai&#8217;i. it’s just disgusting. Appeal Act 55.</p>

<p>Andre’ Perez. I am here tonight to put you on notice again that we are still under an illegal occupation. You have no authority over us, our lands. This public land destruction corporation exempts lands from zoning requirements…what is that going to mean day-today. This pldc is ambiguous and vague. Even when the lawas are clear, the state refuses to follow them. Don’t forget, this attempt is endorsed and administered by  governor Abercrombie.</p>

<p>Mahealani Traub. This is really saddening to me to think that some corporation can come in and take our &#8216;aina away from us. This corp is governed by five members. Why can&#8217;t the public say what we want to do with our &#8216;aina? We simply cannot allow this to happen. We do not need the PLDC. The PLDC is a corporation to take away our &#8216;aina and do what they want with it. Act 55 is not going to do any good, whatsoever. We want to repeal Act 55.</p>

<p>Nameaaea Hoshino; You guys just don’t get it. How dare Abercromie try to bring this to the table. I am tired of this, having to come and speak to you guys to try to get you to understand. The things we are fighting for are more important than making the money.</p>

<p>Robert Harris, testifying on behalf of 12000 members statewide. We suggest that you include or incorporate that projects that will have adverse environmental impacts will NOT go forward.</p>

<p>Lancelot Haili: the PLDC was not created for the people, by the people. We all have to follow the law, even the governor.&nbsp; I am here to request that you repeal Act 55.</p>

<p>Shannon Wood:&nbsp; Please establish formal procedures for the public to submit public testimony [as others have been doing  for decades].</p>

<p>Eric Gill: Represent 10,000 hotel workers. Inadequtiee protections for working people and working peoples rights. The main concern here is not the admin rules themselves, but the PLDC itself. Passed with little or no public discussion. Those of us who had concerns…no bill was heard. This is the first opportunity the public has had to discuss whether this is a good idea or not. ~The Hawaiian people’s control over development is being bypassed here. The people of Hawaii are frustrated that they are not being listened to. This PLDC has crystalized this for us. This PLDC has brought unions and environmentalist together because we all fear that the governor is giving to much power to developers.&nbsp; The notion to balance the budget is to take lands…forefathers…and develop them. I personally am offended by that. Opposed to the bill in its current form. If it’s a good development the people will support it. If it’s a bad development, it shouldn’t happen.</p>

<p>Ester Carey: People are frustrated about our broken political system. The PLDC is broken, and the rules don’t protect our interests. It is important that public lands belong to the public. </p>

<p>Alison Lum: We talked with 12000 voters. People are distrustful of the government. People are quite frankly disgusted. We wold like to think that we can trust our government, you folks as well, but …we can’t. Unite together and fight to repeal Act 55. Not just for ourselves, but for our children and  our children’s children future.</p>

<p>David arakawa: in support of the PLDC’s rules.</p>

<p>Alex Luka: this Act 55 puts more stress on the mission statement of the DLNR. </p>

<p>Kat Brady: everything secret degenerates. You are responsible. The land is public. You need to udnerstnad that pono means inclusivity. </p>

<p>Bill Sager. I will work for the repeal of act 55. </p>

<p>David Kimo Frankel: the rules give the PLDC unfettered discretion to make decisions. He said Mr. Aila has the power and opportunity to do some real good here. &#8220;The choice is yours,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Cynthia Rezentes: You have no guidelines for yourself, no criteria on how you would take these lands and use them in concert with the communities. These rules say you are going to do what you want to do, when you want to do it. That’s wrong. Just wrong. There’s got to be a better way. There is no cooperation in these rules. That is unacceptable. The public sure doesn’t deserve it.</p>

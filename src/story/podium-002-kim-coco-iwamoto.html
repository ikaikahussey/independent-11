<p><a href="https://www.kimcoco.com/">Kim Coco Iwamoto</a> has big plans for the LG&#8217;s office: she wants to turn the space into a People&#8217;s office where activists and ordinary citizens can come to make sure their voices are given equal weight with those of special interests and corporations who currently wield disproportionate influence at the legislature. From her mother&#8217;s experience growing up in a Japanese internment camp in California to her own struggles with discrimination in the work place, Iwamoto has learned what it means to fight against injustice and seeks to bring her determination to the ʻEwa wing of the Capitol&#8217;s fifth floor.</p>

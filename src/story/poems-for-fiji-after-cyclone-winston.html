<p>Cyclone Winston, the strongest storm ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, made landfall across the archipelago of Fiji in February of this year. The category-5 storm brought winds above 200 miles an hour and waves up to 40 feet high. The devastation was heartbreaking, with many homes destroyed, more than 60,000 people in evacuation centers and nearly 50 dead. </p>

<p>Governments and aid organizations across the Pacific and the world have come together to raise money and provide aid to the people of Fiji. A group formed  in Hawaiʻi, “Aloha Appeal for Fiji,” which organized several benefit events. One event was a poetry reading organized by Pacific Tongues, a non-profit focused on poetry, spoken word, youth and activism. I had the honor of helping organize this event and performing one of my poems. To learn more about fundraising efforts, and to donate yourself, please click this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1202871199771529/">link</a>.</p>

<p>In solidarity with these efforts, students in my eco-poetry course wrote poems for Fiji. We read several examples of poetry in response to natural disasters and discussed how poetry can be one way to raise awareness and express sympathy, grief, healing and hope. We also talked about the emotional and ethical difficulties of writing such poetry.

<p><strong>For Fiji </strong><br />
by Ryan Gapelu</p>

<p>I dreamt last night<br />
that brown bodies, again,<br />
were under water.</p>

<p>In this dream<br />
I heard a roaring from the east<br />
I heard the revolving walls of wind<br />
we know and fear so well in the Pacific<br />
swirling about heavy like concrete<br />
running like the tide into the shore.</p>

<p>In this dream<br />
I saw the sky darken<br />
eclipsing the light that feeds you<br />
suffocating you under a sea of grey.</p>

<p>In the darkness<br />
I heard a quiet rumbling of agony<br />
stifling the voice of a people<br />
the shrill whisper of death<br />
pushing into houses, turning over beds<br />
spilling out of windows<br />
flooding the street, following you,<br />
watching over your shoulders<br />
holding out its hands to catch you.</p>

<p>In this dream<br />
I stood in the mixing of soil and sea water<br />
brown bodies running past<br />
brown bodies floating past<br />
little Apisai drifting out into eternity.</p>

<p>And I am scared.</p>

<p>Scared because,<br />
when devastation raptures brown bodies,<br />
when nature bares her teeth,<br />
when we are at the hands of our maker<br />
on our knees praying to your gods<br />
that we are valuable, that we are worthy<br />
praying please do not let us die<br />
I can hear the silence of every footstep<br />
from Suva to Jerusalem<br />
from Koro to California</p>

<p>And I am scared that again,<br />
Oceania will be forgotten,<br />
scared that again, the melanin in our skin<br />
is the determining factor of our aid<br />
scared that the media will stand with Paris<br />
but not Fiji<br />
because gunshots speak louder<br />
than climate change<br />
because sea levels mean nothing<br />
to high rises<br />
because disaster does not exist<br />
unless you are in it<br />
even when you hear it<br />
when you see it<br />
and<br />
I cry<br />
Till the sun wakes me.</p>

<p>in the morning I see:<br />
Fiji, turning over the rubble<br />
collecting the scattered pieces of their home<br />
Fiji, counting their dead<br />
but holding dearly to their living<br />
Fiji, in despair but steadfast,<br />
Fiji, alive in the faces of her children<br />
bathing in rivers<br />
smiling<br />
I see Fiji smiling,<br />
and softly on the wind in Hawai’i<br />
I swear I can hear<br />
voices singing:</p>

<p>For Fiji, ever Fiji<br />
let our voices sing with pride<br />
For Fiji, ever Fiji<br />
her name hail far and wide<br />
a land of freedom<br />
hope and glory<br />
to endure whate’er befall<br />
may God bless Fiji<br />
forever more.</p>

<p><strong>An Open Letter to Cyclone Winston </strong><br />
by Leilani Portillo</p>

<p>Dear Cyclone Winston,<br />

<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Thank you.<br />
You gave me a wake up call—<br />
A reality check.<br />
You made me realize how social media engulfs us,<br />
Suffocates us with celebrity gossip,<br />
And pretty pictures.<br />
You showed me how exclusive it is.<br />
I saw no post,<br />
No comment<br />
No sign.<br />
Social media has been used<br />
To spread awareness<br />
But you have shown me where it has failed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;   But fuck you.<br />
Fiji didn’t deserve this.<br />
You were named the 2nd strongest hurricane in the world.<br />
You ripped trees from their roots,<br />
Houses have been turned upside down and inside out,<br />
Tens of thousands of people have been displaced.<br />
You flooded their lands<br />
And destroyed their crops.<br />
You brought on<br />
Pain, heartache, death, and destruction.<br />
44 are dead.<br />
Families torn apart.<br />
What was once their home<br />
Is now<br />
Nothing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;   There is suffering<br />
But Fiji is strong<br />
And its people are already<br />
Rebuilding.<br />
They are picking themselves up<br />
And salvaging what they can.<br />
Soon they will be drinking kava<br />
And leaving you only in their memory.<br />




<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Sincerely,<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; A Small Girl in a Big World </p>

<p><strong>Ballad to Fiji</strong><br />
Marcos Cruz Ortiz</p>

<p>Enduring not far from me<br />
Are brothers and sisters of the same skin,<br />
From the same voice I will sing for Fiji
<br />
And pray for their lost kin.<br />
And pray for their lost kin.</p>

<p>A nation of islands suddenly torn<br />
130 million years of earth,<br />
Picked up from the ocean where it was born<br />
4000 years of Fijian births.</p>

<p>All hit together<br />
All at once,<br />
It was a hurricane, cyclone<br />
Winston made its descent.</p>

<p>The beauty of the country caught his eye<br />
Struck the coast with his breath,<br />
Spoke too close, he started to cry<br />
When he realized his cause for death.</p>

<p>Passing the islands he turned and counted<br />
42, 43, 44,<br />
Loved ones turned to numbers<br />
Their words and memories no more.</p>

<p>Enduring not far from me<br />
Are brothers and sisters of the same skin,<br />
From the same voice I will sing for Fiji<br />
And pray for their lost kin.<br />
And pray for their lost kin</p>

<p>Because we are all one nation in the sea<br />
Oceania is our home,<br />
Our ancestors knew how to be<br />
Respectful towards nature&#8217;s creed.</p>

<p>But those outside of our fate<br />
Have forgotten about her beauty,<br />
Progressing with so called innovation<br />
They laugh at our mother&#8217;s face</p>

<p>She&#8217;s forced to remind them of her wrath<br />
With 180 mph winds,<br />
She sends Winston in to crash<br />
And punish them for their sins.</p>

<p>But she sends him to the wrong place<br />
Not to first world homes locked in a screen,<br />
But to people living in grace<br />
To account for tourist&#8217;s dreams.</p>

<p>So I will scream, shout and pray<br />
For those enduring close to me<br />
Brothers and sisters of the same skin<br />
With one voice we shall sing for Fiji <br />
With one voice we shall sing for Fiji.</p>

<p><strong>One Sip For Fiji From Me, One Girl in Hawaii</strong><br />
Jessica Carpenter</p>

<p>A bowl of Kava scooped from and rotated<br />
Its turns churning the traditions of Fiji in time<br />
Mixing the conversations from straight shoulders and high heads<br />
Skulls and piko kissing the heavens with pride<br />
Laughter chatter and rustling of the sea<br />
To the tune of a sun falling and rising to display the beautiful creations<br />
With feet blessing the Earth they have been nurturing<br />
Since the great lights began their waltz<br />
The bowl turns<br />
Deep liquid, numbing cooling earth<br />
Falling down the throats of Polynesia<br />
You sing and it happens<br />
The sun rose slow and somber the seventh day of February<br />
Slumbers are disturbed and you can hear the stuff of nightmares<br />
I am no victim<br />
Let that be known. I was not there. I didn&#8217;t stand and have no choice but<br />
To swallow the torture of seeing my history crumble<br />
Blown and shattered in front of my eyes<br />
Yet, the mere imagination of this is pricks my own with tears<br />
The silence around that glossy bowl is haunting<br />
And sympathy and presence is all I can ever bring to the circle<br />
I can only say on behalf of the rest of the world<br />
That still manages to turn while you pick up the pieces<br />
I am sorry<br />
I can only say on behalf of the rest of Hawaiʻi, worlds away from our sister<br />
As our tides rise and fall and your hope lifts and pulls just the same<br />
E kala mai<br />
I can only say on behalf of humanity itself<br />
That this is the time to show each other that we don&#8217;t like seeing you hurt<br />
And that the sight of naked desperation and fear is contagious<br />
This is not an open letter to Fiji<br />
This is a cry for awareness<br />
This is a wake up call<br />
This is a spank minor to the beating our sweet sister had to endure<br />
This is a reminder to Fiji and all people<br />
Who have had their direction of life disturbed<br />
Their compasses flipped<br />
And their atmosphere stifled<br />
And oxygen tanks, body bags and gallons of morphine<br />
Will never take the place of breathing humanity<br />
E KO MĀKOU MĀKUA I LOKO O KALANI<br />
Where are you<br />
Our father which art in heaven<br />
In heaven<br />
Show me where you are<br />
I want to see you in the eyes of those who still have life coursing through them<br />
The stars are no longer just strung up diamonds<br />
They are the souls of those lost and the only reminder of who they used to be<br />
This time the kava bowl is turned<br />
Scooped from<br />
And the numbing kicks in but<br />
We don&#8217;t want to be numb<br />
We just want to talk<br />
and Let the words heal.<br />
I take my earthy sweet sip<br />
And my first words are<br />
I am here, and I know.<br />
But I feel I will never truly know. </p>

<p><strong>Outsider </strong><br />
Thomas Ilalaole</p>

<p>I arrive at the battered remains <br />
of a puzzle that’s been destroyed, <br />
not by its players, but a relentless storm. </p>

<p>I examine the jagged <br />
cardboard edges. Now soggy,&nbsp; <br />
the ink is blurred…lost pieces now <br />
erased from memory…never to be found.</p>

<p>I salvage what I can <br />
hoping to restore the puzzle’s <br />
unrecognizable image, so that I can see.<br />
See what it was, what it is….<br />
and what I can do to make others see. </p>

<p>Oceans and mountains.<br />
Towns and houses.<br />
Garbage and wreckage.<br />
Men, women and children. <br />
Every piece is displaced. <br />
and I feel helpless…<br />
Others don’t seem to get why <br />
this puzzle matters…<br />
“It’s one of many,” they say. </p>

<p>They rocket themselves to <br />
a planet eons away and proclaim,<br />
“Oh that puzzle? We’ll get a new one!”</p>

<p>To Them, this taken-apart puzzle was <br />
just a “game” and now it’s a permanent <br />
statistic: 42 dead and 50,000 rescued. <br />
Still no refuge…left alone…to die.<br />
I ask myself, how am I supposed feel?<br />
What should I say or do? Can this be real?<br />
This puzzle is indeed in front of me,<br />
begging to be reassembled.<br />
Yet time continues on without it,<br />
as we let it fade out of mere existence. </p>

<p>I can’t do this on my own, but I have to try <br />
because getting my head in this so-called<br />
“game” is better than remaining willingly <br />
idle on the bench like the rest of Them. </p>

<p>To most, I’m an outsider looking in.<br />
But to this puzzle, I’m an outsider who’s <br />
willing to look in – ask questions, seek <br />
answers, and search for pieces of peace. </p>

<p>All over the world, there are broken <br />
puzzles with incomplete stories…histories<br />
left untold – forgotten in a sea of the rewritten.</p>

<p>Typhoons, Cyclones, Hurricanes, <br />
Storms, Tsunamis, Earthquakes. <br />
Call it what you will. But rain, wind, <br />
earth and water are all they same.<br />
They breathe the same energy to create such <br />
forces that descend these puzzles into utter<br />
chaos – bending their frames until they <br />
flood. </p>

<p>This puzzle is Fiji, and it’s our job to <br />
help put it back together…one piece at a time.</p>

<p>Something Happened<br />
Isaiah Yamaguchi</p>

<p>On February 20th something – happened.<br />
While you were at home<br />
And you did not know, that <br />
Something – happened.<br />
While you were wrapped in a blanket of warmth<br />
With concerns of your own,<br />
Something – happened.<br />
It is “ok” if you do now know,<br />
Shrouded by social media, we are SO easily heard, yet deaf to the voices that cry the loudest.<br />
At least 42 lives lost to Winston,<br />
But thousands more left without… food, water, shelter, and their families.<br />
Amazing really, the largest storm in the southern hemisphere to date,<br />
And only now you know.<br />
Everyday something happens,<br />
But not everyday you can do something about it.<br />
So now that you know, go make something—happen.</p>

<p><strong><br />
Recollection</strong><br />
Mary Archer</p>

<p>I was four walls charged with years of hard words<br />
I was the angle of my discontent<br />
The stubborn joint of an arrow pointed upstream<br />
I was a peaked roof<br />
An “up yours”<br />
To the world I knew not of<br />
I was a speck<br />
And my thoughts within me a windstorm<br />
I was four walls and a roof<br />
The division of space &nbsp;   from space<br />
I was content<br />
I was resigned<br />
Now this space is free<br />
It’s recollected by sky<br />
It’s part of winds and great currents<br />
It’s part of air and being<br />
The wind where my house is<br />
Is calm<br />
If I go there I’ll see space<br />
Instead of walls<br />
My walls are down <br />
I was a house but I became the sky</p>

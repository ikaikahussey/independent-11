<p><b>Plantation Generations</b></p>

<p>My grandfather went to war and back<br />
to get off Pepeekeo Plantation.<br />
A bullet shattered his cheek and tore out his back,<br />
crawled to base until cuticles cracked.</p>

<p>Sent to military hospital to recover<br />
in Germany, befriended an enemy who became<br />
a bed side neighbor<br />
and life long correspondence<br />
just the kind of man he was.<br />
But not a response from home;<br />
his lover kept unopened letters stashed away.<br />
She didn&#8217;t want him to leave,<br />
so, instead of grieve, she leaves the<br />
letters sealed in a corner, like her heart,<br />
tucked in chest.</p>

<p>Edmund Cambra loved to learn<br />
but on Pepeekeo Plantations<br />
goals don&#8217;t stretch past the next harvest,<br />
dreams are the hardest<br />
because Icarus views of plantation stores and fields<br />
causes the wax to wane,<br />
before morning light<br />
sneaks through windowpanes<br />
mourning the morning again.</p>

<p>Edmund was offered an education<br />
in town, off the plantation.<br />
But his father rejected the gesture;<br />
couldn&#8217;t let one of his sons run off and learn,<br />
fields needed to be turned,<br />
teenage muscles burned,<br />
and sugarcane learns to fight back with<br />
every machete hack<br />
slashing across where paper cuts could be.</p>

<p>When Pearl Harbor was attacked<br />
recruiters came to camp<br />
and Edmund was one of the few<br />
who could sign more than just an &#8216;X&#8217;.</p>

<p>On a German pasture<br />
just like any other<br />
my grandfather learned<br />
that scouts and snipers don&#8217;t mix<br />
and he was left for dead.<br />
Only him and God knew different.<br />
There is no confessional<br />
quite like a quiet foxhole.</p>

<p>Scenic fields feel different crawling on your belly<br />
afraid of yelling in pain or for help.<br />
My grandpa&#8217;s hardest footsteps are<br />
marked with bloody palm prints<br />
and shards of fingernails impaled<br />
in every next step dug in the soul<br />
but there was a woman at home&#8230;<br />
and sometimes that&#8217;s enough.</p>

<p>Purple-heart in tow he headed home<br />
and made my father and gave him two brothers.<br />
See, my father was born plantation poor.<br />
Where you needed to hustle for newspapers if<br />
you wanted to teach yourself to read.<br />
Where your daily chores caused you to bleed.<br />
Where you would have everything you could want<br />
and not enough of what you need.<br />
This is where my family tree sprouted its seeds.</p>

<p>My grandfather killed grandfathers to see farther<br />
that the plantation and<br />
I&#8217;m sure in his nightly conversations<br />
with God he promised<br />
to never put his future generations<br />
in similar situations;<br />
determined to provide his offspring opportunity<br />
through education.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a grotto giving thanks to the Virgin Mary<br />
at St. Joseph in Hilo.<br />
My grandfather landscaped their campus<br />
so they would take his seeds;<br />
studied the school books alongside his sons,<br />
used his boys’ lessons to pass engineering tests .</p>

<p>My family has a history of following hearts<br />
rather than wallets.<br />
My grandma left comfort of upper-class<br />
to be the wife of a field worker.<br />
But she saw a fire in his eyes;<br />
a desire to build aspirations that would span generations<br />
as all three of their sons graduated past plantations.</p>

<p>Ronald went further than island dreams.<br />
A local boy pursuing goals over an ocean<br />
hoping to open doors locked to his father.<br />
Being the first &#8216;Cambra&#8217; etched on a UH Hilo diploma<br />
was not enough.<br />
Grandpa said &#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221;<br />
and in search of a higher rank,<br />
deployed to UH Manoa;<br />
and after the flashes, decorative sashes<br />
Edmund stashes that degree to be hung<br />
and displayed and said<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s Next?&#8221;<br />
In Washington he became a doctor<br />
of education and communication,<br />
found his other half,<br />
came back home to make a family.</p>

<p>Kicking and screaming I&#8217;m following<br />
my parents&#8217; footsteps<br />
but in my own path.<br />
Part SPED, part Higher Education.<br />
Part classroom, part administration<br />
With no union for Poet Substitutes,<br />
so I fly without a net.<br />
Earn student respect;<br />
part because of what I am teaching,<br />
part for making it poetic;<br />
entirely because I give it back.<br />
And now I am proud of what I do;<br />
help teens through hard times<br />
Through raw rhymes in free-writes.</p>

<p>If you were to tell the teenager in me that I would<br />
grow to be a teacher, the class clown in me<br />
would&#8217;ve thrown something at you.<br />
The jock in me would&#8217;ve given you a wedgie<br />
and the poet in me would&#8217;ve said nothing.<br />
Because at 17 I did not see a future in my feelings,<br />
didn&#8217;t believe that education could provide like a jump shot.<br />
In basketball you only need one bad fall to end it all;<br />
I also learned why the Achilles is a suiting name;<br />
it&#8217;s never the same.<br />
But in poetry, wrong falls make for more poetry,<br />
so I&#8217;ve got a litany of potential literature.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve really learned:<br />
Doing what you love is more important<br />
than doing what you&#8217;re told;<br />
but if you are going to break molds and rules,<br />
you need the tools to build a brighter tomorrow.<br />
So I<br />
use poetry to reach a generation<br />
with a failed education<br />
but a passion to learn.<br />
And when it&#8217;s their turn,<br />
take the bridges we&#8217;ve burned and<br />
build from the ashes,<br />
wish on eyelashes.<br />
Equality becomes our equation<br />
when we leave no child behind, stuck on plantations.</p>

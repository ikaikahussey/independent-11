<p>The ʻōhiʻa is one of the most important native trees in Hawaiʻi. Native birds and snails, who themselves are endangered, depend on the ʻōhiʻa for food and shelter. The beautiful, flowering tree is also significant to Hawaiian genealogy, culture, literature and arts.</p>

<p>Tragically, the ʻōhiʻa forests are under attack from a disease called Rapid ʻŌhiʻa Death (ROD), which decimates tree within just a few weeks, leaving behind white skeletons. In the past few years, more than 100,000 trees have died from the disease, with many more threatened. </p>

<p>Many researchers, scientists, activists and conservationists are working to protect the ʻōhiʻa. The Seed Conservation Laboratory at UHM’s Lyon Arboretum has started an “ʻōhiʻa love” campaign to collect and save ‘ōhiʻa seeds. (For more information, and to donate, go <a href=" https://www.gofundme.com/ohialove">here</a>. Additional information can be found <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/news/2016/02/07/seeding-the-future-of-the-ohia-tree/">here</a>.) </p>

<p>I am currently teaching an “Eco-Poetry” undergraduate course in the English department at the University of Hawaiʻi, Mānoa (UHM). We study and write poetry addressing the themes of nature, environmentalism, ecology, climate change, food, and animals. We believe that poetry (and the humanities in general) have the power to raise awareness and cultivate empathy, compassion, and care. </p>

<p>Students in my class have written poems as our way to express our love for the ʻōhiʻa. We offer these poems in two segments over the course of a week. Feel free to share our voices, and to write your own poems in response. (Read <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/poetry-for-the-hia-tree">part 1</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Give ʻŌhiʻa Love</strong><br />
Isaiah Yamaguchi</p>

<p>ʻŌhiʻa tree, blossoms, Lehua flower. Long lost lovers, fates intertwined,<br />
Roots that are ingrained with culture, preserving more than just nature.<br />
Branches uprooted, twisting in the sky, you are home to many<br />
You were the first to cultivate molten rock, a true survivor,<br />
Now you are your own prey. Victim of Rapid ʻŌhiʻa<br />
Death, thousands lost in just weeks. What can we<br />
Do? Preserve, support, and spread the word<br />
Hope is not yet lost for ʻŌhiʻa<br />
Always remember that<br />
Without ʻŌhiʻa<br />
We lose.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>A Promise to ʻŌhiʻa</strong><br />
Jessica Quayle</p>

<p>Thumping through your core<br />
Red, thick intravenous, intertwining,<br />
Twisting—<br />
Locked together, constricting,<br />
Growing,<br />
Through the crust, lava bursts,<br />
and gives birth.</p>

<p>Vulnerable and small,<br />
the keiki ʻōhiʻa<br />
a reflection of stars overarching,<br />
protecting, watching,<br />
blood pumps through,<br />
green leaves deepen<br />
their roaring rhythm calling</p>

<p>the ‘apapane, a heart in the sky,<br />
perches and gulps,<br />
its red feathers admired <br />
from a woman afar.</p>

<p>Faintly, trembling, she answers the bird’s gaze,<br />
he looks deep through her eyes<br />
and sees anemia wrestling, cursing,<br />
her weakening blood.<br />
He flies over close, and whispers in her ear <br />
secrets of healing<br />
the kahuna lapaʻau once showed him.</p>

<p>The keiki ʻōhiʻa then takes her hand,<br />
selfless, generous,<br />
he lays in it<br />
two leaves—<br />
nā pono lapaʻau <br />
to cure her aching blood.</p>

<p>The ‘apapane watches,<br />
each day, and the woman grows strong,<br />
heavy on her cheek, one day, a tear,<br />
he asks her what’s wrong.<br />
Her heart beating too full,<br />
indebted to the ʻōhiʻa,<br />
he whispers secrets of servitude<br />
his life’s dedication,<br />
ʻōhiʻa pollination—<br />
for generation upon generation.</p>

<p>The morning sun beating,<br />
hot, comforting, <br />
the woman awoke and began walking,<br />
heavy and strong,<br />
each step on red dirt, <br />
weighted with respect;<br />
responsibility.<br />
Kneeling down she looked up,<br />
the sky endlessly tall,<br />
the ʻōhiʻa, still small,<br />
she begged to serve him,<br />
to preserve him,<br />
for her children, she knew,&nbsp; <br />
may one day need him.</p>

<p>“When my grandchildren suffer,”&nbsp;  &nbsp; <br />
the ʻōhiʻa responds, <br />
“from the tragedy i dreamt is still to come,<br />
quickly—they will crumble,<br />
ashes on molten ground,<br />
and the Earth’s pulse <br />
will make a new sound.<br />
Tree after tree will drop,<br />
melting into Earth,<br />
and their redemption will fall with them,<br />
landing in the hands of you and your children.” </p>

<p>The woman nodded in acceptance,<br />
signifying her undying promise.<br />
The ‘apapane takes another sip,<br />
and around them—rustling lava,<br />
cooling, slowly moving,<br />
becomes calm. </p>

<p>Now is the time,<br />
the dreaded day has come,<br />
we must keep the woman’s promise,<br />
before the last ʻōhiʻa has gone.</p>

<p><strong>He aliʻi ka ‘āina ke kanaka</strong><br />
by Robert Souza</p>

<p>“An attack on one is an attack on all.”<br />
Different cultures speak different truths.<br />
Does this epidemic affect the all, or does it affect the one?<br />
Do the trees not give of themselves<br />
To provide essence of life for animals and us?<br />
Are we to let the luscious green scapes of our youth<br />
Be reduced to a dark landscape?<br />
How can we, when we have all seen <br />
The beauty that came before it.<br />
ʻŌhiʻa trees are thankless confidants,<br />
Rarely do we recognize their importance.<br />
Silent caretakers, <br />
Facing the threat of death.<br />
Even so, they stay solemn and silent<br />
Never asking for help.<br />
And yet, we must intervene<br />
To save the ʻŌhiʻa that have so cared for us.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>#ʻōhiʻalove</strong><br />
Marcos Cruz Ortiz</p>

<p>Ears ringing from your screams<br />
I turn my head<br />
To the island of my birth<br />
And feel your death.</p>

<p>What will happen when you are gone?<br />
If it rains<br />
When we lose your flower<br />
And you your lover<br />
Then will the mountains bleed<br />
When we lose you?</p>

<p>What poison attacks<br />
Your twisted branches?<br />
Able to thrive in lava,<br />
Petals capturing its glow<br />
Yet you are helpless<br />
To this invader—Intruder<br />
Fungal Explorer<br />
He strangles you whole.</p>

<p>From our home<br />
He chokes away<br />
Years of growth<br />
Years of blossoming.</p>

<p>In one<br />
Just one<br />
Month and it’s over.<br />
Your suffocated leaves<br />
Lose their breath<br />
Turn brown and fall.<br />
I have lost thousands of you<br />
How many more<br />
Must I see vanish?<br />
You who have watched my ancestors go<br />
Cried raindrops on their last breath<br />
I will shed frozen showers on yours.</p>

<p>What will happen when you are gone?<br />
Will the mountains bleed onto me?<br />
ʻōhiʻa lehua <br />
Pele’s sacred pua<br />
Let these lovers be.</p>

<strong>A Love Torn Apart </strong><br />
Thomas Ilalaole</p>

<p>Blossoming out of molten rock <br />
lava trickles through their bodies.<br />
They glow red and fire heats their core.</p>

<p>Born from ashes, <br />
she was gentle and sweet. <br />
He was strong and handsome. <br />
From the moment they met,<br />
they were destined for each other. </p>

<p>But Pele wanted him for herself. <br />
She courted and batted her eyes,<br />
As he ignored her, glazed over <br />
with love rooted deep in the earth.<br />
This left Pele enraged with <br />
bitter jealously. </p>

<p>Without hesitation she turned<br />
ʻŌhiʻa into a twisted tree.<br />
Then the mighty gods <br />
reached down and placed Lehua<br />
on the tree as she gracefully <br />
transformed into a beautiful red flower.</p>

<p>But don’t be fooled.<br />
This love story doesn’t <br />
have a happy ending. </p>

<p>ʻŌhiʻa and Lehua are dying.<br />
Devastated by natural disasters<br />
and human destruction.<br />
Their seeds are no longer fruitful.<br />
They are fighting to stay together<br />
and to stay alive. </p>

<p><strong>Message Upon the Wind</strong><br />
Asanté Abdallah</p>

<p>The morning sky opened clear.<br />
I made pause—<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  at the edge of a river<br />
noting the wind,<br />
blowing past, pulling color out of the air.<br />
When we note tragedy,<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  When the drops of rain pulled from the deepest eye,<br />
Cyclical iris,<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; fall upon <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   running down the leaves<br />
soaking into the earth—<br />
elemental creation seeking to bring &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Life.<br />
Then <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   We view death,<br />
reverberating, coursing, humming its lute,<br />
promising, foregone,&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  campaigning<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   the seemingly inevitable degradation.<br />
We say,<br />
Bismillah, In the name of God,<br />
How can this happen?<br />
These days should be cloaked in an eternal rain.<br />
Lovers are being torn apart,<br />
Twisted from the inside &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Out.<br />
Diseased invader infiltrating the roots<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Their genealogy.<br />
The birds cry for mercy upon the waves in the wind,<br />
Long, red fingers, extension of a beating heart &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Reach,<br />
prying to speak,&nbsp;  &nbsp;  attached to the dying arms of her lover.<br />
Golden—<br />
Fanned, spindled, facing angles <br />
hoping,&nbsp; pleading, licking the heat—&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   the tendrils<br />
arching up in humility to feel the warmth of the ascending sun<br />
once more,<br />
simply begging as to &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Why.<br />
The river preserved in their union spirals up.<br />
Mist.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Diffusion.<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   It creeps in, the consciousness alive in message,<br />
absorbs into our skin.<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Listen.<br />
He ali‘i ka ‘āina, he kauā ke kanaka. <br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   I cannot divorce myself from what I must know.<br />
Our existence from river to reed is one.<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   It was the rain that yielded the flower<br />
not thunder.<br />
And within this letter it speaks to reason<br />
Provoke a thought,&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   and move a current.<br />
For to save what was and Saw the eye of eternity<br />
is to take one small step towards absolution.<br />
Selah is what we say,<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; To pause and think about what you just heard.<br />
I say,&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Breathe it in.<br />
Inshallah, and this message shall<br />
Diffuse.</p>

<strong><br />
Dialogue with an EverDying Tree </strong><br />
by Mary Archer</p>

<p>Good morning,ʻōhiʻa . Good morning, little one. <br />
I heard a story about you. Yes, what did you hear? <br />
Hawaiians say your gnarled wood and bloom are two lovers married. Ah, that one. Yes, I have heard it too. <br />
Are the lovers fighting? Is their love dying? Why are so many of you aging quick and whitening?<br />
Some loves die. <br />
But so many of you are going. My people are crying. How could the red bloom go? Lehua? She grows tired. ʻ ōhiʻa does, too. But their seeds survive. <br />
Then I will gather them.<br />
Rest here a while, little one. Let us both remember how to ripen quiet and slow.</p>

<hr>

<p>The ʻōhiʻa is one of the most important native trees in Hawaiʻi. Native birds and snails, who themselves are endangered, depend on the ʻōhiʻa for food and shelter. The beautiful, flowering tree is also significant to Hawaiian genealogy, culture, literature and arts.</p>

<p>Tragically, Hawaiʻi’s ʻōhiʻa forests are under attack from a disease called Rapid ʻŌhiʻa Death (ROD), which decimates trees within just a few weeks, leaving behind white skeletons. In the past few years, more than 100,000 trees have died from the disease, with many more threatened. </p>

<p>Many researchers, scientists, activists and conservationists are working to protect the ʻōhiʻa. The Seed Conservation Laboratory at UHM’s Lyon Arboretum has started an “ʻōhiʻa love” campaign to collect and save ‘ōhiʻa seeds. (For more information, and to donate, go <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/ohialove">here</a>. Additional information can be found <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/news/2016/02/07/seeding-the-future-of-the-ohia-tree/">here</a>.) </p>

<p>I am currently teaching an “Eco-Poetry” undergraduate course in the English department at the University of Hawaiʻi, Mānoa (UHM). We study and write poetry addressing the themes of nature, environmentalism, ecology, climate change, food and animals. We believe that poetry (and the humanities in general) have the power to raise awareness and cultivate empathy, compassion and care. </p>

<p>Students in my class have written poems as our way to express our love for the ʻōhiʻa. We offer these poems in two segments over the course of a week. Feel free to share our voices, and to write your own poems in response. (Read <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/poetry-for-the-hia-tree-2">part 2</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Ka ʻŌhiʻa</strong><br />
By Leilani Portillo</p>

<p>There is a ʻōlelo noʻeau that says<br />
“He aliʻi ka ʻāina, he kauā ke kanaka.”</p>

<p>The ʻōhiʻa tree<br />
Faces a premature death.<br />
A fungus is consuming<br />
The forest.</p>

<p>In just two weeks,<br />
Hundreds more ʻōhiʻa trees will be dead.<br />
It’s not a painless death<br />
For the tree is strangled<br />
The sapwood plugged<br />
And it cannot transport water.</p>

<p>Ka ʻiʻiwi<br />
Ka ʻapapane<br />
Ka ʻākohekohe<br />
Depend on the ʻōhiʻa<br />
The island’s water supply<br />
Depends on the ʻōhiʻa<br />
Hula <br />
Depends on the ʻōhiʻa<br />
We<br />
Depend on the ʻōhiʻa</p>

<p>Just like the ʻōlelo noʻeau<br />
“He aliʻi ka ʻāina, he kauā ke kanaka.”<br />
The land is chief and the people are its servants.<br />
No laila,<br />
Inā ʻaʻole lākou, ʻaʻole kākou.<br />
If there is no them, there is no us. </p>

How to Survive Rapid Death </strong><br />
by Ryan Gapelu</p>

<p>How do you repel a disease<br />
That poisons your blood so severely<br />
It withers you to an ashen white husk<br />
Like the dust you were born from<br />
Stripping the life from your bones</p>

<p>How do you repel a disease<br />
That does not care<br />
That your love for each other<br />
Is so deeply rooted<br />
The gods dared not see<br />
You apart</p>

<p>How do you mourn the sound<br />
Of a thousand quiet deaths<br />
Gnashing teeth? Pulling hair?<br />
Bloodying ourselves<br />
Regretting that we could not protect you</p>

<p>How do we fight?<br />
How do we fight?</p>

<p>We mourn—then stand, ready<br />
Because this is not the first time<br />
Rapid death has come to Oceania<br />
This is not the first time <br />
Diseased white bodies have sprouted in our stead<br />
This is not the first time<br />
Our living have been outnumbered by our dead<br />
We have been here before</p>

<p>How do we fight?</p>

<p>We carry the dead in us<br />
We hold sacred breath<br />
Over the last ‘ohi’a tree<br />
We pray over archived seeds<br />
We await your return<br />
We do not forget</p>

<p>We breathe life into ‘Ohi’a<br />
We run our hands across the name<br />
Like our fingers caressing the twisted body<br />
He was cast in<br />
We carve the blushing red beauty<br />
Of the name Lehua onto our tongues<br />
And remember the depth of her love<br />
Was infinite</p>

<p>We dance the memory of the lovers<br />
Into our songs and stories<br />
That they should always live again</p>

<p>We do not forget<br />
‘Ohi’a and Lehua have conquered death before<br />
We do not forget<br />
They could do it again<br />
Do not forget<br />
Do not forget<br />
Do not forget<br />
The loss of their memory<br />
Is the true rapid death</p>

<p><strong>Lele Nā ʻUhane o Nā ʻOhiʻa</strong><br />
by Jessica Carpenter</p>

<p>A ruby heart<br />
Caged in frosty ribs of snow<br />
With each pluck of this soft thorny gem<br />
Falls a crackling flood<br />
A blessing, a cry, a breathe of life to wash away drought</p>

<p>A pale opal pearl<br />
Encased in grey, brittle shell<br />
For every fall <br />
A feather dusts the pine below<br />
With the absence of a single pluck<br />
With the silence of a chant<br />
With the stifling of a breathe<br />
To put out every fiery cheek</p>

<p>Your crowns fall down<br />
Constant as the rain it causes<br />
And silent as a slap from an axe is brutal<br />
Its quiet, roaring passionate fiery ʻeleu mana <br />
Plummets to a flatline<br />
What used to be a beautiful sunrise <br />
To hōʻike the blossoms of life you laid to birth<br />
Is now shameful exploitation<br />
To the tune of excruciating silence </p>

<p>A dry dark congregation <br />
As each bone laid to rest<br />
After each bud has leaped<br />
Lele nā ʻuhane</p>

<p><strong>The Tree Snail</strong><br />
Mireille Doth</p>

<p>You know others have the wrong idea about folk like me. <br />
They figure we got a home that we walk around with safe and warm. <br />
Keeps the rain off our backs, and the bad guys from getting in, <br />
but you know a house is not a home. <br />
A home is where you eat and get shelter from the sun. <br />
My home was the Ohi&#8217;a. <br />
A pretty amazing home at that. <br />
Erupting in crimson and ivory. <br />
Flourishing by the side of the road. <br />
I only saw the others when they extracted buds to create leis. <br />
Never bothered me much.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br />
Always more blooms the next day,<br />
but now the flowers come No more. <br />
No nectar<br />
No shade<br />
A dead thing &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   <br />
The sun beats down<br />
and I am thirsty<br />
and ravenous <br />
and destitute <br />
Dying in my own shell, and no one seems to care. <br />
No flowers for their fair leis, but I have lost my cradle, and my dusk has come.&nbsp; </p>

<strong><br />
Eulogy of the ʻōhiʻa</strong><br />
Christina Lee</p>

<p>Are we so different, <br />
you and I? <br />
Like Eve,<br />
the lovely lehua blossom grows<br />
upon the twisted ʻōhiʻa tree. </p>

<p>Picking the blossom, <br />
severing Man from his <br />
Lover;<br />
a separation of matrimonial harmony <br />
of Nature <br />
and Man. </p>

<p>Now, <br />
what is left<br />
but the melancholic melodies,<br />
thousands of millions dead <br />
in no greater than a decade; </p>

<p>For the last of the ‘Apapane have died<br />
with the Death of Man; <br />
and a eulogy is chanted <br />
in the funeral filled with <br />
scattered brown leaves<br />
underneath its bone-white branches. </p>

<p>As the last blossom falls, <br />
turning crimson petals into blood, <br />
we mourn sweet sorrow, <br />
the death of Good<br />
&amp; the skeletal remnants <br />
of Mankind. </p>

<p>*</p>

<p><strong>Forever ʻŌhiʻa</strong><br />
Zach Donovan</p>

<p>Oh, Beautiful ʻŌhiʻa tree<br />
Sacred to all mighty Pele<br />
Her spirit thrives along your fiery red and yellow flowers<br />
You are the first spark of life to rise when her lava rushes down the mountains<br />
You are quite a brilliant creation<br />
Helping provide food for many birds and watershed cover for our water supply</p>

<p>We cry, we cry, we cry<br />
At the sight of your bone dry skeletons<br />
I don’t know why this deadly disease is on this earth<br />
But what I do know is<br />
It’s given us an unstoppable drive to make sure you never disappear<br />
Your seeds have been getting stored for decades<br />
Making sure your beauty and health will never leave the islands</p>

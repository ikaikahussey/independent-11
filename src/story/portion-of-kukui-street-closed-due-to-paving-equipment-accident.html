<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Kukui Street is currently closed from Queen Emma Street to Pali Highway due to an accident involving a contractor’s paving equipment.</p>

<p>This portion of Kukui Street is expected to be closed for approximately 24 hours. Motorists are advised to use a different route to access Kailua-bound Pali Highway, and to listen to the radio for updates from the City’s Traffic Management Center. The closure will also affect southbound traffic on Queen Emma Street.</p>

<p>The accident involved a contractor’s piece of heavy equipment that fell over earlier this afternoon. A crane will be brought in to right the equipment and move it.</p>

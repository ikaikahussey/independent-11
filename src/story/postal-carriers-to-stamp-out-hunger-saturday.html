<p>HONOLULU – More than 240,000 mail carriers will lead the Postal Service’s effort to “Stamp Out Hunger” by collecting food donations throughout Hawaii and in cities and towns across the country on Saturday, May 14 in the 19th annual National Association of Letter Carriers’ Food Drive. </p>

<p>The drive is the nation’s largest one-day effort to combat hunger and is held to support the mission of community food banks such as the Hawaii Foodbank. Last year, about 1,000 of Hawaii’s mail carriers collected more than 565,000 pounds of food items, led by the 48,000 pounds collected by the Wahiawa Post Office and its Mililani Station carriers. More than 77 million pounds were collected nationwide last year; more than one billion pounds of food has been collected during the campaign’s first 18 years.</p>

<p>Residents are urged to place non-perishable food items next to their mailbox for pickup on May 14 before their usual mail pickup time. The mail carriers will then transport the donations back to their Post Offices where postal employees and their families will sort the food and deliver it to their nearest community food banks. Post Offices without residential delivery will be collecting items during the week leading up to May 14. </p>

<p>“The NALC Food Drive is a big help because it always results in a lot of canned protein items, which are our ‘Most Wanted’ items.” said Mike Kajiwara, Hawaii Foodbank Director of Product Donations. Kajiwara listed the following as the most desired food donations: Canned meats or tuna, canned meals such as chili, stew or spaghetti, canned soups, and canned fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>“Our goal in Hawaii is to top last year&#8217;s totals, but with the weak economy it may be difficult,” said Adele Yoshikawa, Pearl City Carrier and NALC Food Drive Chairperson. “Our donation totals last year were 3 percent less than the previous year, and the Hawaii Foodbank reports an eight percent decrease in donations from all sources over the last two years. To make up for that shortfall, we’d like to ask those who are more secure to give a little more.”</p>

<p>More than 183,500 people, including 55,000 children, receive emergency food each year through the Hawaii Foodbank network, an increase of 39 percent since 2006. A 2010 study cited by the Foodbank draws a clear link between the recent economic downturn and the increased need for emergency food assistance. </p>

<p>“This drive is a wonderful opportunity for us to demonstrate to our communities that our Postal Service does more than deliver the mail. It shows that we can make a positive difference and we truly care about helping others.” said Yoshikawa. </p>

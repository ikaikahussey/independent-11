<p>HONOLULU&#8212;As part of the preliminary engineering work for the Honolulu Rail Transit Project, the City and County of Honolulu will conduct shaft testing in East Kapolei beginning Tuesday and later in Waipahu. During this time, current soil testing for the project will continue along Farrington Highway.</p>

<p>The shaft and soil testing will provide data that will be used in the design of the first 6.5-miles of guideway for the rail transit route between East Kapolei and Pearl City. Kiewit Infrastructure West Company, selected to design and construct the first segment of the rail route, has been authorized by the City to conduct the shaft testing.</p>

<p>“The shaft and soil testing will provide key information to help properly design the guideway,”&nbsp; said City Department of Transportation Services Director Wayne Y. Yoshioka.</p>

<p>There are eight shaft testing locations along or adjacent to Farrington Highway. Work at each location is scheduled to take approximately six weeks and all work is slated to be completed by late January 2011.</p>

<p>Work along Farrington Highway will require some day and nighttime lane closures during non-peak traffic hours between 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. One lane of traffic in each direction will remain open.</p>

<p>The public will be notified in advance of detours and change of access with traffic control signs, and special duty police officers to direct traffic at affected intersections.</p>

<p>Motorists using Farrington Highway in Waipahu are advised to anticipate possible traffic delays or take alternative routes.</p>

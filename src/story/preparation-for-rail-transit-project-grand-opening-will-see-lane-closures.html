<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City Department of Transportation Services advises motorists that both mauka-bound lanes of North-South Road (Kualakai Parkway) between Kapolei Parkway and Farrington Highway will be closed from 5:00 a.m. Monday, February 21 to 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, February 22, in preparation of the groundbreaking ceremony for the Honolulu Rail Transit Project.</p>

<p>Because of safety and security issues, the two mauka-bound lanes of North-South Road in Kapolei will be closed during the groundbreaking event set for Tuesday morning along the roadside. The turn lanes from Kapolei Parkway onto North-South Road will also be coned off during the scheduled lane closures. Area motorists desiring to travel in the mauka-bound direction should use alternative routes such as Fort Weaver Road or Fort Barrette Road. </p>

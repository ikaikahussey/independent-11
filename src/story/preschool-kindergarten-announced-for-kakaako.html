<p><a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/urban-beat-hawaii-community-development-authority-update">As we reported earlier this month</a>, Hawaii Community Development Authority (HCDA) executive director Anthony Ching said in a public meeting that there would be an announcement about a new, projected preschool-kindergarten building as part of the Kakaako redevelopment plan.</p>

<p>Well, that announcement was made yesterday. Duane Shimogawa of Pacific Business News reported that Seagull Schools would open a new location within Kakaako Waterfront Park. The preschool would accommodate 150 children, ranging from 2- to 5-years of age, inside a renovated &#8220;warehouse that’s currently being used as storage for maintenance equipment.&#8221; </p>

<p>The nonprofit private schools&#8217; executive director Chuck Larson was quoted as saying that a conceptual design for the Kakaako school was just completed. Shimogawa went on to report that &#8220;the plan is to open the new school in two years with permitting and regulatory issues still needing to be resolved, such as signing a lease with the (HCDA), conducting an environmental assessment, building permits and the design process.&#8221;</p>

<p>This will be the seventh Seagull School in the state, with a current count of six on Oahu and one on Hawaii island.</p>

<p>As for the possibility of a new school for kindergarten-age children, that hasn&#8217;t been addressed yet. Ching mentioned at the public meeting that nearby Royal and Queen Ka‘ahumanu Elementary Schools are either at or near capacity, so “there will be a need to augment the needs” in that area.</p>

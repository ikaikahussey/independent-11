<p>President Obama&#8217;s favorite shaved ice spot was the subject of a light show last week, as part of a multi-site protest to raise awareness of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p>

<p>Over two dozen protesters demonstrated last week in Kailua to raise awareness of the pending international treaty, which is being negotiated with the help of over 600 multinational corporations, behind closed doors.</p>

<p>It is estimated 40% of the world’s Gross Domestic Product will be regulated by the TPP treaty.&nbsp; With something this large, and this many “corporate advisers” there have been leaks with sections of the treaty.&nbsp; Several of these leaks raise significant concerns among small and medium sized business owners, farmers, labor unions, physicians and environmental advocates.&nbsp; As public awareness grows, so does public concern.&nbsp; There have been recent protests in numerous countries and throughout the US, including in Hawaii.</p>

<p>As an example, the leaked chapter on Intellectual Property reveals large pharmaceutical companies have successfully included extensions to patents on brand name drugs to prohibit the introduction of lower costs generics.&nbsp; Doctors Without Borders has initiated a campaign to raise awareness as well.</p>

<p>Only 5 of the 29 TPP chapters reportedly deal with trade.&nbsp; The remaining chapters include a smorgasbord of very attractive perks for large multinational corporations surrounding intellectual property, patents, monetary exchange, environmental, health and safety rules.&nbsp; Some of the companies providing advice for the new international environmental rules include: Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, Halliburton, Monsanto and Dow Chemical.</p>

<p>One of the most troubling issues is the way disputes will be settled.&nbsp; The multinational corporations will be provided “Investor State” status, whereby they can bring a cause of action against a participating nation for restricting potential future profits.&nbsp; There will be international tribunals established to decide the case and award the damages.&nbsp; This international tribunal is patterned after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and subsequent US treaties that have created controversy throughout the US and the other nations.</p>

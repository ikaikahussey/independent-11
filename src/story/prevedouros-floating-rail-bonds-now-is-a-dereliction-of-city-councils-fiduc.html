<p><i>The Honolulu City Council is considering granting <a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/city-county-of-honolulu-details-bond-rail-financing/123" target="_blank">permission to float $2 billion in bonds</a> to pay for initial rail contracts. The following is a letter to Honolulu council members from civil engineering professor and former mayoral candidate Panos Prevedouros.</i></p>

<p><strong>Dear Council Members,<br />
</strong><br />
It appears that several of you are misinformed about the status of the rail project. Here is a five line update:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; The city does not yet have [Federal Transit Administration] FTA approval to enter Final Design.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; The City has not completed Final Design. It is still collecting the necessary samples.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; Only after Final Design is completed, the City can enter into a Full Funding Grant Agreement with the FTA.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp; Only then the actual dollar commitment of the feds will be set in terms of monies and year of expenditure.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp; At that point, Congress has the prerogative to cut the funding, reduce the funding, or grant it as stated.</p>

<p>See for yourself: <a href="http://www.apta.com/gap/legupdatealert/2011/Pages/2011April20.aspx" target="_blank">www.apta.com/gap/legupdatealert/2011/Pages/2011April20.aspx</a></p>

<p>Congress cut FTA&#8217;s New Starts by a whopping 20 percent for 2011.</p>

<p>The 2011 New Starts funds for the whole nation is $1.59 billion and Honolulu is asking for $1.55 billion!</p>

<p>Floating bonds before federal funds are secured is a dereliction of your fiduciary duty and lack of due diligence.</p>

<p><strong>Mahalo,<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Panos Prevedouros</strong></p>

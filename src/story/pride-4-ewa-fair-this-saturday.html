<p>EWA&#8212;In its 15th year, the annual Pride 4 Ewa fair looks to revive the spirit of the west side this Saturday, May 8 at Keaunui Park. This year&#8217;s attendance will determine whether the fair continues on for Leeward residents in the future.</p>

<p>From 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., the &#8220;Pride 4 Ewa 2010: Bringing our Community Together&#8221; fair will be open for the public for live entertainment, food, crafts, and games that showcase talents and resources in the Ewa Beach community. The event, hosted by major sponsors Ewa By Gentry Association, Gentry Homes, and Hawaiiana Management, will also feature games, rides, and activities for the keiki, lucky number drawings throughout the day, crafters, ono food, and, again this year, a resource fair highlighting the programs and activities available to youth in Ewa.</p>

<p>&#8220;The main reason we have had this program for this long is to gain awareness of programs that are available for the youth and get them headed in the right direction,&#8221; said Alex Rodriguez, event coordinator for almost 10 years. &#8220;The programs available are there for youth to stay out of trouble.&#8221; </p>

<p>Despite the event&#8217;s positive message, there has been a noticeable drop in attendance in recent years, Rodriguez said. Attendance at this year&#8217;s fair is critical as Rodriguez and the Ewa Beach Community determined that if attendance did not pick up, then this would be Pride 4 Ewa&#8217;s final year. However, if the numbers increased, then it would continue on and Rodriguez said he &#8220;is looking forward to doing it another year.&#8221; It was Rodriguez&#8217;s decision to make the 2010 Pride 4 Ewa entrance free. </p>

<p>Along with free entrance fee, any youth that brings in a can good or monetary donation for Food Bank of Hawaii will receive a wristband, giving them free access to all rides all day.</p>

<p>Rodriguez, an Ewa Beach resident who works at Waialae Post Office, was able to partner up the event with the National Association of Letter Carriers, which is also having its annual food drive this Saturday. Cans collected at the fair will be given to Food Bank of Hawaii and the Ewa Beach Post Office will be credited for it. </p>

<p>For those young at heart but not so much in size, there will be much food to enjoy including Time 2 Grind plate lunches, Kettle Corn Hawaii, and Slush Puppy Hawaii. In addition, there will be live performances by Sunway, Kawao, Maunalua, and Kapena.</p>

<p>&#8220;The biggest thing this year is the great lineup of entertainment, and good giveaways, including a 52 inch flat screen TV,&#8221; Rodriguez said. &#8220;There will also be prizes throughout the day. All this stuff is free for anyone and donations go to Food Bank Hawaii so it&#8217;s a win-win situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Parking is available at Holomua Elementary and up and down Keaunui Drive&#8212;The Honolulu Police Department will allow parking on both sides of the road for that day. There will be a trolley available throughout Ewa by Gentry to get you to Keaunui Park located at 91-1795 Keaunui Drive.</p>

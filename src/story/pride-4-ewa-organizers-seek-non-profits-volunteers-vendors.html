<p>In preparation for what’s shaping up to be a great event this year, organizers for “Pride 4 Ewa: Celebrating Ohana Together“ are asking local businesses and non-profits to come and be a part of the fun.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ewabygentry.net/" target="_blank">Ewa By Gentry Association</a>, Gentry Homes, and Hawaiiana Management are sponsoring the free annual event, which will be held on April 30 from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. at the newly opened Hoalauna Park on Keaunui Street. An outdoor movie screening will end a day filled with live music, games, raffle prizes, crafts, non-profits, and, of course, plenty of food. There will also be a resource fair to encourage health and wellness and foster productive activities for keiki and ohana.</p>

<p>“This is an opportunity, not only for Gentry community, but for everyone to come out and get to know one another,” said Madeline Hill, an organizer with the Ewa By Gentry Community Association. “With so much we’re working to put together, we really want everyone to come out.”</p>

<p>Applications for non-profit, food, and craft vendors are being accepted until April 8. Volunteers and sponsorships are also being welcomed. </p>

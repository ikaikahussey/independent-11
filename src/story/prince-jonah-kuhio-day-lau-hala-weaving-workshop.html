<p>Two of Hawaii&#8217;ss renowned kumu lau hala (expert teachers)&#8212;Aunty Gwen Kamisugi and Aunty Lorna Pacheco&#8212;and seven members of their weaving community will stage a four-day traditional lau hala weaving intensive workshop at the Academy Art Center at Linekona.</p>

<p>The Kumu Lau Hala will introduce students to the values of hoohanohano (honoring culture with pride and care), aloha (respect and care for each other), malama aina (care of place and resources). All are living aspects of what is learned in the weaving of lau hala. We weave to create relationships and understanding of Hawaiian cultural traditions, knowledge, resources and place.</p>

<p>According to Kamisugi, in the not-so-distant past, weaving the leaves (lau) of the hala tree was a traditional practice in most Hawaiian families. Weaving was a way to create objects of beauty for everyday living as well as things of wealth, exchange and offerings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lessons learned in the weaving of lau hala deepen Hawaiian cultural values, ones that are being embraced and cherished once again by the Hawaiian community and the people of Hawaii,&#8221; Kamisugi said.</p>

<p>Novice, intermediate and veteran weavers may come by any time during the four days for a half or full day of weaving, sharing prepared meals and relaxing conversation with new and old friends. The kumu will help students get started on a weaving project that is geared to their available time and weaving experiences.</p>

<p>New and returning weavers will be able to finish a simple lau hala project in a session or two. First-time weavers receive a manuwahia free lau hala kit for weaving a bracelet. Other novice projects include earrings, ornaments, T-shirts, honu and angels. For those looking for more involved weaving projects, the full immersion weekend will bring them the reward of a hat, purse or mat, as well as the embrace of a part of the lau hala community.</p>

<p>VSA Hawai&#8217;i and the University of Hawai&#8217;i Center on Disability Studies are the sponsors of this Native Hawaiian cultural workshop.</p>

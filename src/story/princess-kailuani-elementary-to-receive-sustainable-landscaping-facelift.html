<p>KALIHI &#8212; Princess Victoria Kaiulani Elementary School will be getting a landscaping makeover on Saturday, with the help of community partnerships and the hard work of faculty and staff. The school is in need of a sustainable landscape facelift that can be maintained by the school staff. The volunteers will be landscaping different areas of the campus and planting native Hawaiian plants donated by <a href="http://www.hawaiiannativeplants.com/" target="_blank">Hui Ku Maoli Ola</a>. Most of the other work will also include removing invasive plants and trash, and installing irrigation lines.</p>

<p>As part of <a href="http://www.westonsolutions.com/" target="_blank">Weston Solutions’</a> “Making A Difference” event, Representative Karl Rhoads, school faculty, Weston Solutions, Hui Ku Maoli Ola, and M Nakai Repair Service are sponsoring sustainable improvements and beautification of the school’s campus. This is the first of many projects with Kaiulani School.</p>

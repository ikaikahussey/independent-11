<p>The Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP) has completed its comprehensive review of the revised Central O‘ahu Sustainable Communities Plan (SCP) and it is now available to the public for review.<br />
 <br />
The plan will be presented at the Waipahu Neighborhood Board meeting on Thursday, May 25, at 7 p.m. in the Filipino Community Center, 94-428 Mokuola Street. The DPP has already made presentations to the Wahiawā/Whitmore Village Neighborhood Board and the Mililani Mauka/Launani Valley Board.<br />
 <br />
The revised document is an update of the 2002 Central O‘ahu SCP, which is the city’s guide for the future of the region that includes Wahiawā, Mililani, Mililani Mauka, Waipi‘o, Kunia, Waikele and Waipahu.</p>

<p>Central O‘ahu is expected to experience moderate growth between now and 2040, with the addition of 12,600 new housing units to accommodate projected population increases. According to the DPP, &#8220;The plan provides capacity for residential development while protecting 10,350 acres of high-quality agricultural land. The updated plan also addresses the need for affordable housing in Central O‘ahu, revitalization of Waipahu and Wahiawā, and the protection and conservation of natural resources.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plan has been submitted to the Planning Commission, which is expected to hold a public hearing on Wednesday, July 19, 2017. The commission will make a recommendation to the City Council for further review and action.<br />

With legal challenges currently in progress, previous protests had stopped construction until recently when concrete was poured directly over the well-documented bones of ancient Hawaiians on the property.    \"We're sick of rich foreigners coming over here and destroying the resting places of our families,\" said Keli`i Collier. \"Hawaiians do not desecrate the graves of others, why do they desecrate ours?\"    Mr. Brescia's claims of property ownership is also being disputed by Kaiulani Eden-Hoff, a former media personality who traces her lineage back several centuries on that parcel.

<p>Advocates for public access television networks – such as <a href="http://olelo.org">‘Olelo Community Media</a> on O‘ahu, or <a href="http://akaku.org">Akaku</a> for Maui Nui – are calling attention to a <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2012/bills/HB2652_.htm">bill</a> which would force a major reorganization of the networks. According to an <a href="http://akaku.org/Main-page/VOTE-NO-ON-HB2652.html">Akaku blog post</a>, the bill would lead to a 2/3 reduction in funding for public access television broadcasting. The bill, HB 2652, is scheduled for a hearing on Monday at 2:15 pm in State Capitol room 325.</p>

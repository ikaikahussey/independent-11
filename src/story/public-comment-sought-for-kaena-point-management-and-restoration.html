<p>NORTH SHORE&#8212;The Kaena Point Advisory Group (KPAG) will present potential management recommendations for the Mokuleia portion of the Oahu wilderness area, and is seeking public comment at next week’s meeting of the North Shore Neighborhood Board, on Tuesday, July 27, 2010. The meeting will take place at 7:00 p.m. at Haleiwa Elementary School Cafeteria, 66-605 Haleiwa Road.</p>

<p>In recent years, the unimproved/unpaved portion of Kaena Point State Park has experienced an increase in off-road activity resulting in severe erosion, damage to sand dunes, endangered plants, and cultural resources. Degradation of natural, cultural, and historical resources have also been caused by illegal bonfires, rave parties, and other inappropriate use.</p>

<p>The Kaena Point Advisory Group was formed by the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) in April 2009 to work with the public in forming recommendations for a Kaena Point Management Plan. The group is comprised of representatives including conservationists, cultural practitioners, fishermen, Friends of Kaena Point, North Shore Neighborhood Board, Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Oahu Island Burial Council, Waianae Neighborhood Board, and the YMCA Camp Erdman.</p>

<p>The advisory group aims to engage in constructive discussion to find a balance between various interests and user groups and to advise DLNR on preferred management solutions for Kaena Point.</p>

<p>Its mission is to better utilize integrated natural and cultural resources management approaches to increase protection and restoration of coastal areas at Kaena Point while supporting sustainable, low-impact recreational opportunities for the public that retain the natural feel of the area and honors its cultural significance.</p>

<p>In the past year, KPAG has conducted several site visits and dune protection work days at Kaena Point, discussed park issues and reached consensus on several recommendations and options for the state park. The group also had access to DLNR staff from several related divisions to provide clarification on rules, policies, and resources at every meeting and event.</p>

<p>Public comments will be accepted in writing at the meeting and by email to KPAGcomments@gmail.com.</p>

<p>KPAG will review the public comments and present its management recommendations to the Board of Land and Natural Resources (Land Board), at which time the public will have additional opportunity for input. Once the Land Board adopts a management plan for the area, the advisory group will assist DLNR with its implementation.</p>

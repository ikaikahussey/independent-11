<p>The agenda for the special session is filling up: marriage equality, possible gubernatorial appointments, and now Kauai hospitals and public worker contracts.</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>

<blockquote><p>Governor Asks Legislature to Expand Special Session Agenda</p>

<p>HONOLULU – Gov. Neil Abercrombie has asked the Hawaii State Legislature to expand the agenda for the upcoming special session to include measures relating to health services on Kauai and the funding of two recent collective bargaining agreements. </p>

<p>Along with a revised Marriage Equity Bill, the Governor today provided three additional measures addressing an emergency $2.5 million appropriation for Hawaii Health Systems Corporation services on Kauai and funding of collective bargaining agreements achieved with United Public Workers (UPW) Unit 10 and Hawaii Government Employees Association (HGEA) Unit 13. </p>

<p>“In addition to convening the Legislature in special session to primarily consider marriage equity in Hawaii, there are several other items that require legislative attention,” Gov. Abercrombie said. “These important matters include continuation of essential regional health care services on Kauai, as well as funding of two agreements reached in good faith with members of Units 10 and 13.” </p>

<p>Nearly two months ago, the Governor’s Office shared an initial draft of a marriage equity bill with legislators, news media and the public – including posting it on the Governor’s website – to facilitate public input. The bill provided today to the Legislature includes several updates aimed at further balancing equal protection and religious freedom, based in part on input received from various stakeholders. </p>

<p>The bills are expected to be posted on the state Legislature website at: <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/">www.capitol.hawaii.gov</a></p>

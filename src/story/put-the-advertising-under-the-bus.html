<p>Hawaii adopted a statewide ban on billboards in 1927. This highly regarded law was designed to protect the heart of tourism and the quality of life of those of us living here.</p>

<p>Mayor Caldwell has a bill attempting to degrade a statute that has served us well for the past 86 years.</p>

<p>Bill 69, proposing advertising on City buses and para transit vehicles, is well beyond a slippery slope. Rather it is more like a giant sinkhole with the potential to engulf the rapidly<br />
diminishing aesthetic qualities visitors and residents covet.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next? Billboards on the rail, school buses, garbage trucks? </p>

<p>Mobile billboards destroy a sense of place, making every community look like &#8220;anywhere USA&#8221;. Mobile billboards divert attention from natural scenic landscapes as well as unique cultural art such as historic building and statues.</p>

<p>And unlike cell phones, there is no off or delete button!</p>

<p>Mayor Caldwell states that he is “willing to negotiate”. </p>

<p>How about this?&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Put the advertising UNDER THE BUS. The same place Bill 69 is attempting to throw the present billboard law.</p>

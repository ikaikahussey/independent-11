<p>The revitalization of Chinatown into an arts and cultural district has long been witnessed and discussed by those businesses and denizens that have seen it first-hand. That revitalization has remained a part of Honolulu&#8217;s collective conversation because it is ongoing. PYNK Salon, 40 North Hotel St., is another new business optimistic about what is happening in Chinatown. </p>

<p>This First Friday, July 2, PYNK will be holding an S&amp;M party from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. for singles who want to mingle. Everyone is welcome.

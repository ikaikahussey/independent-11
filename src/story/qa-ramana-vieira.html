<p><em>Fado</em> – which shares the same root as the English word &#8220;fate&#8221; – is a traditional Portuguese style of mournful singing, around which Ramana Vieira is orchestrating a new modern sound. We caught up with her for a few brief questions.</p>

<p><strong class="question">How did you become interested in Fado?</strong></p>

<p>I grew up listening to my mother singing the songs of Amalia Rodrigues, but it wasn&#8217;t it until I took my trip to Portugal during my late teens and was dared to sing in a Fado House in Lisboa how deeply ingrained and fulfilling it is to sing Fado.</p>

<p><strong class="question">Fado is an incredibly cathartic, emotional genre. What do you tap into for your performances?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m naturally passionate because I&#8217;m after all Portuguese! </p>

<p>Also I studied theater at the famous American Conservatory Theater. In that theatre training we were coached to tap into life changing moments. I have a deep well of emotional experiences from which to tap into and I use them when I sing the music. Its deeply fulfilling for me and I find very carthardic as you best said. Its a purging of the soul in an artistic way.</p>

<p><strong class="question">Hawaii has its own history of Portuguese migration in the 19th century. Do you have a special message for Hawaii&#8217;s Portuguese community?</strong></p>

<p>I relate because my own parents from Madeira migrated to California. I greatly appreciate the warm welcome I have received  on previous tours to Hawaii from SCOPO which stands for State Convention of Portuguese Organizations,Trigo from ADEGA restuarant in Honolulu, and other people in the Portuguese community. I think it is wonderful that the Hawaiian Portuguese community is interested in preserving our roots. It gives me great pride to be a part of the celebration of our heritage.</p>

<p>1. What wave(s) are comparable to J-Bay, if any? <br />
None, it&#8217;s one of a kind. It&#8217;s one of the best right hand waves in the world.</p>

<p>2. In 2 words, how cold is the water?<br />
Pretty minor. (while the tour is there anyway&#8212;I&#8217;m sure it gets colder.) </p>

<p>3. What size board are you hoping to ride at J-Bay?<br />
6&#8217;0 shorty, for speed and maneuverability.</p>

<p>4. What is the BEST thing about going to J-Bay/South Africa?<br />
J-Bay, if your able to score it good you&#8217;ll have the best session of your life.</p>

<p>5. What is the WORST thing about going to J-Bay/South Africa?<br />

3 to 5 days early depending on flight availability.</p>

<p>9. Is J-Bay fun on your backhand?<br />

Sleeping pills, strong ones. The flight is brutal.</p>

<p>The flyers appear to make the point that if a UH student isn&#8217;t Native Hawaiian, he or she is simply &#8220;other.&#8221; What makes the flyers puzzling is that it is hard to tell whether the flyers are pro-Hawaiian or anti-Hawaiian. Are the flyers implying that &#8220;others&#8221; should be treated as illegal aliens, or are they implying that &#8220;others&#8221; feel as though they are already treated as such by Native Hawaiians who are, in some warped reality, dominant over whites living here? There is precedent for both sentiments, but the real story is what these flyers triggered. </p>

<p>A student-led response challenged the notion that racial differences can&#8217;t be converted into cultural appreciation by setting up a space for students to post more flyers—this time signed—in support of racial equality and social justice:</p>

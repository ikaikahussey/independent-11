<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The State of Hawaii is receiving $75 million as part of phase 2 of the Race to the Top competition&#8212;a $4.35 billion nation-wide effort to dramatically re-shape America’s educational system.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Education made the announcement this morning that Hawaii is among nine states and the District of Columbia in the competition’s second round of grant awards.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“Hawaii won this grant by improving its score by almost 100 points, the biggest gain of any of the winners. The hard work Hawaii’s education leaders put in over the past several months truly paid off,” said Congresswoman Mazie Hirono, a member of the House Education and Labor Committee. “Hawaii won this highly competitive grant by bringing everyone to the table, including teachers, administrators, and union and community leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Race to the Top is designed to provide incentives to states to find ways to begin making the changes that business, political, community, and education leaders feel are needed to boost student achievement.</p>

<p>The only states prohibited from applying in phase 2 were those that received awards in phase 1. In the first phase of competition supporting state-based reforms, Delaware and Tennessee won grants based on their comprehensive plans to reform their schools and the statewide support for those plans.</p>

<p>Hawaii, in the midst of having the shortest school year in the nation due to furloughs, was not among the finalists selected for phase 1 of the competition.</p>

<p>“Securing this grant is just a stepping stone,&#8221; Gov. Linda Lingle said. &#8220;We will now begin the hard work of implementing our education reform plan, which includes a common core curriculum tied to a new on-line State test while tracking student progress and rewarding teachers by linking 50 percent of their evaluation to student achievement. I am especially excited about our pledge to have 100 percent of high school graduates ready for a career and college without the need for post secondary remediation programs.&#8221;</p>

<p>States competing for Race to the Top funds were asked to document past education reform successes, as well as outline plans to: extend reforms using college and career-ready standards and assessments; build a workforce of highly effective educators; create educational data systems to support student achievement; and turn around their lowest-performing schools.</p>

<p>Hawaii’s plan in its phase 2 application intends to:</p>

<p>• Raise overall K?12 student achievement. By 2014, Hawaii’s goal is to increase its Hawaii State Assessment (HSA) scores to 90 percent in reading and to 82 percent in mathematics. By 2018, students will be proficient in reading and mathematics. Additionally, Hawaii students’ National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores will meet or exceed the national median score by the year 2018.</p>

<p>• Ensure college? and career?readiness: By 2018, the overall high school graduation rate will increase from 80 percent to 90 percent and all graduating students will be earning the new “college? and career?ready” high school diploma, which requires that students meet STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) competencies.</p>

<p>• Increase higher education enrollment and completion rates: By 2018, the college?going rate of Hawaii’s high school graduates will increase from 51 percent to the national median of 62 percent. Through the Hawaii Graduation Initiative, UH also plans to increase the number of college graduates by 25 percent annually by the year 2015.</p>

<p>• Ensure equity and effectiveness by closing achievement gaps: By 2014, the gap between groups and all students in state assessment scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment rates will be reduced by 50 percent. By 2018, the gaps will be eliminated.</p>

<p>• Increase STEM proficiency statewide and highly effective STEM instruction in Title I schools: All new teacher hires in Title I (high?poverty) schools for STEM subject areas and other hard?to?staff subjects will be highly qualified/highly effective by 2011.</p>

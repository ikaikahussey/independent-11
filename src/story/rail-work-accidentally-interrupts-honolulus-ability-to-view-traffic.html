<p>AIEA&#8212;A Kiewit Infrastructure West Co. subcontractor&#8217;s construction vehicle working on Honolulu&#8217;s rail transit project struck an overhead communications line near Aloha Stadium today, affecting the City&#8217;s traffic camera coverage.</p>

<p>Cameras covering the Central and Leeward Oahu area are out of service due to the incident, and crews are expected to work through the night to make the necessary repairs, <a href="http://www.honolulutransit.org/hart.aspx" target="_blank">Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transit</a> (HART) officials said.</p>

<p>&#8220;We understand that many commuters rely on these cameras for their traffic updates, and we are working diligently to get the needed repairs done as quickly as possible,&#8221; Kevin Rozendaal, a project manager for Kiewit, said in a statement. &#8220;We are sorry for any problems this may cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>A vehicle used to locate utilities struck the overhead line on Kamehameha Highway and Honomanu Street, cutting the fiber optics cable and disabling the cameras, Kiewit officials said.</p>

<p>Kiewit notified the City and inspectors were sent out to inspect the damage and to consult on a repair strategy. No injuries were reported.</p>

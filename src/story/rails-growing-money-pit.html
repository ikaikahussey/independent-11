<p>The Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transit (HART) experienced another fiscal shortfall, recently, when General Excise Tax (GET) surcharge revenues in the latest quarter fell $8 million short of projections. That brings rail’s total tax deficit to $39 million. This is just the latest in a growing list of financial blows and disappointments related to the state’s largest public works project ever. Here’s a timeline of some of rail’s financial setbacks:</p>

<p>2010-2011: HART faces <a href="http://www.midweek.com/railing-about-hart-pr-expenses/">mounting criticism</a> over the amount it is spending on public relations, presumably to manage negative press and speculation into the controversial rail project. Over-compensation and -employment for HART communications is estimated in the hundreds of thousands, at least. In July, 2012, HART CEO Dan Grabauskas finally cuts half the PR staff. </p>

<p>May, 2013: HART approves more than $10 million to pay for delay costs after a Hawaii Supreme Court decision halts construction. </p>

<p>September, 2013: <a href="http://www.progressiverailroading.com/safety/news/HART-to-install-safety-gates-at-21-rail-stations—37592">Safety gates</a> to prevent riders from falling onto the future rail tracks were accidentally left out of the initial project budget. The nearly $30 million dollars needed to build and install the gates will now come from the project’s contingency fund. </p>

<p>August, 2014: Bids to build the first nine rail stations come in <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2014/08/13/honolulu-rail-station-bids-come-in-75-higher-than.html">more than $100 million over projections</a>. HART originally budgeted $184 million (including contingency funds of $34 million) for building the stations, but the lowest bid came in at $294.5 million.</p>

<p>November, 2014: Concerns over rail’s electricity supply arise. HART previously said relocating utility poles, electricity lines and other utility infrastructure would cost $63 million, but that did not include the actual cost of electricity, which was an unresolved matter with Hawaiian Electric Company. </p>

<p>December, 2014: A financial assessment released by rail authorities says the project is on track to cost <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20141218_Honolulu_rail_costs_to_climb_at_least_500_million.html?id=286269771">$500 million more than expected</a>. Officials blame lagging tax revenues, rising construction costs and project delays. HART’s total contingency fund is just $538 million.</p>

<p>January, 2015: Rail’s budget shortfall rises to $910 million, bringing the total cost of the project to more than $6 billion. </p>

<p>March, 2015: Bids to build three rail stations in Waipahu come in far above projections. The city estimated building stations at Leeward Community College, Waipahu and West Loch would cost between $60-75 million, but the lowest of five bids came in at just under $79 million. </p>

<p>July, 2015: Amid growing concerns about rail’s funds, Governor David Ige signs House Bill 134, which <a href="http://www.summitzine.com/posts/oahu-get-surcharge-for-rail-extended-through-2027/">extends the half percent GET surcharge five years</a>, from an end date of 2022 to an end date of 2027. Officials say the surcharge could be extended again if necessary.</p>

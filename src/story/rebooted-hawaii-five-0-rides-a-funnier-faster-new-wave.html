<p>The theme song is familiar, the names haven&#8217;t changed, but much is different on CBS&#8217; new Hawaii Five-0 ...</p>

<p>The updated version of the &#8216;70s classic contains more action and humor, and it examines the personal lives of main characters Steve McGarrett (Alex O&#8217;Loughlin), Danny &#8220;Danno&#8221; Williams (Scott Caan), Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim) and Kono (Grace Park), the last of whom is now a woman. ...</p>

<p>The new series acknowledges the original, from the well-known (&#8220;Book &#8216;em, Danno&#8221;) to the subtle (a clipper-ship painting in McGarrett&#8217;s office). But a reboot, as producers call it, brings extra pressure in the form of comparisons with the original.</p>

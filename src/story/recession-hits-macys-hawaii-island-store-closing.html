The Big Island store has 3 employees.    The other ten stores facing closure are located in Los Angeles, California; Colorado Springs and Westminster, Colorado; West Palm Beach, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Brooklyn Center, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; and Natrona Heights and West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.    The Cincinnati and New York-based department store retailer said the closings will cost roughly $65 million, $12 million of which will be cash, and up to 960 jobs. Most of these expenses will be booked in the fourth quarter of 2008, the company said.    \"These closings are part of our normal-course process to prune underperforming locations each year in order to maintain a healthy portfolio of stores,\" said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Macy's, Inc. \"While new store growth has slowed in the current economy, our long-term strategy is to continue to selectively add new stores while closing those that are underperforming.\"    The company also said today that affected employees in good standing may be considered for open positions at other Macy's locations. Regular full-time and part-time associates who are laid off due to a store closing will be provided severance benefits and assistance in finding employment outside of the company.    The recession hits retail    Macy's retail sales have been affected by the harsh economic climate.

On average, sales in individual stores were down 4.0 percent in December, down 7.5 percent over November and December.    By contrast, while traditional retail may be suffering, Internet commerce seems to show promise. The company reports that online sales on their websites were up by 39.1 percent in December, by 26.0 percent in the November-December period.

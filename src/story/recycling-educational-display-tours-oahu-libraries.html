<p>The City Department of Environmental Services&#8217; recycling educational display is touring Oahu libraries, starting in March with Kapolei Public Library and moving to the Hawaii State Library on South King Street in April during Earth Month.</p>

<p>The display features the new curbside recycling program and life-size representations of the cast of The Green Channel, the new interactive, digital television channel on Oceanic Time Warner Cable 332, and online at <a href="http://www.opala.org" title="www.opala.org">www.opala.org</a>. </p>

<p>Library visitors can watch current episodes of The Green Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Opalavision,&#8221; take photos alongside the life-sized cutouts of the actors, peruse through a selection of recycling and opala-related books available for loan, and check out the blue/green/gray recycling carts to see how cool recycling can be. Opala educational programs are being offered at each library, including recycled craft activities, storytelling, and workshops on &#8220;Garbology.&#8221; </p>

<p>Adult and children&#8217;s books about garbage are far more interesting than you might think with titles including, <i>Worms Eat My Garbage</i> by Mary Appelhof, <i>Smash Trash!</i> by Laura Driscoll, <i>Rubbish</i> by Dr. William Rathje, <i>The Dumpster Diver</i> by Janet Wong, <i>Composting for Dummies</i> by Cathy Cromell, <i>Everything Green Classroom Book</i> by Tessa Hill, <i>Sneaky Green Uses for Everyday Things</i> by Cy Tymony, <i>Michael Recycle</i> by Ellie Bethel, and <i>Garbage, Waste, Dumps and You: The Disgusting Story Behind What We Leave Behind</i> by Connie Colwell Miller.</p>

<p>ENV is donating additional books to further enhance the State Libraries&#8217; selection.&nbsp; Each participating library in the tour receives its own set of 19 books. Additionally, three sets of another 12 books will be donated to the Hawaii State Public Library System. These books were on the librarians&#8217; wish lists, and will go into circulation with a bookplate acknowledging ENV&#8217;s gift.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Recycling has never been more prominent in our lives. By May, Oahu&#8217;s curbside recycling program will be available island-wide to 160,000 homes.</p>

<p>The recycling educational display is currently scheduled to tour eight public libraries on Oahu, and other libraries are expected to be added later:</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Reed Space HNL, a “pop-up” bookstore of art, design, and architectural titles, comes to town on July 28. The event, housed at the Waikiki Parc Hotel, will be the first cutting-edge “pop-up” store of its kind in Honolulu, offering books that represent the pulse of global contemporary visual and design culture at an affordable price point ($15 to $40).</p>

<p>Interisland Terminal, a volunteer-fueled arts organization, conceived of Reed Space HNL out of a desire to see the return of independent bookshops in Honolulu. Founded in January 2009 out of a vested interest in the cultural and socioeconomic life of Honolulu, Interisland Terminal’s mission is to cultivate innovation and creative capital through on-going exhibitions and authentic experiences of contemporary art, film, and design, thus paving the way for the creative approaches needed to address the civic and social challenges facing Hawaii.&nbsp; </p>

<p>According to Interisland Terminal curator, Wei Fang, who divides her time between Honolulu and New York, the organization came about during a low point for Honolulu’s art community, when arts organizations were laying off staff and canceling exhibitions due to a lack of funding. Interisland Terminal sought to fill the void and at the same time bring a fresh vision that would appeal to a diverse audience, including those not currently engaged by Honolulu’s art scene. Fang describes it as a “launching pad” for artistic expression of all sorts in our community.</p>

<p>Reflecting the group’s larger goals, Reed Space HNL’s thoughtfully selected titles aim to nurture the intellect and stimulate creativity. Renowned New York City graphic designer and brand developer Jeff Ng, also known as <a href="http://www.stapledesign.com" title="jeffstaple ">&#8220;jeffstaple,&#8221; </a> is curating the bookstore&#8217;s selection of art, architecture, and design books.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While brainstorming the idea of doing an independent bookstore, it was clear that Interisland Terminal wanted to work with someone from outside the organization and selected Ng, founder and owner of Staple Design, Staple Clothing, and Reed Space. Jeff is a graphic, web, and clothing designer, artist, DJ, writer, and entrepreneur. This Renaissance man’s clients include Burton Snowboards, Converse, The Gap, HBO, Housing Works, Levi’s, LVMH, New Balance, New Museum of Contemporary Art, Nike, NYC&amp;Co., Puma, Timberland, Uniqlo, and more.</p>

<p>Reed Space HNL is loosely modeled on his NYC shop that shares its name&#8212;an innovative pioneer in the “lifestyle boutique” concept, combining street wear apparel and contemporary art&#8212;but will place an emphasis on printed matter and is specifically designed with Waikiki in mind.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Waikiki is among Honolulu&#8217;s most vibrant communities, yet despite being one of its few truly walkable neighborhoods, the tourism hub is underutilized as a center for arts and culture, Interisland Terminal says. In an effort to give Waikiki a stronger arts showing, Interisland Terminal partnered with Waikiki Parc Hotel, who shared in its vision. By agreeing to host Reed Space HNL, the hotel will also secure a prominent place in Honolulu’s growing contemporary art scene.</p>

<p>Due to and despite the throngs of tourists it attracts, Waikiki brings an interesting mix of people from around the world. As a tourist destination, therefore, it is important that it reflects this dynamism by offering more than just beaches and boutiques. Reed Space HNL will provide a contemporary yet welcoming alternative, a place where locals and tourists can browse and co-mingle in the cultural tradition of independent bookstores&#8212;a dying breed in Honolulu.</p>

<p>Reed Space HNL also plans to strike a balance between representing local publications and those from the international contemporary art and design community of which it is a part. UH Press, for example, will be represented with two titles. UH Department of Art and Art History Chair Gaye Chan’s new book, <i>Waikiki: A History of Forgetting &amp; Remembering</i>, is a photography project with a revisionist take on Waikiki. <i>Hart Wood: Architectural Regionalism in Hawaii</i> by Don J. Hibbard, Glenn Mason, and Karen Weitze is a comprehensive and richly illustrated book about the first architect in Hawaii to blend Eastern and Western architectural forms in a conscious manner, back during Honolulu’s territorial days.</p>

<p>To complete the bookstore experience, three supplementary events will highlight the people, books, and ideas integral to Reed Space HNL. The first is a special preview evening of Reed Space Honolulu on Wednesday July 28, from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., which will give guests a first look at its selection of titles, many of which are rare and only available in limited quantities. Tickets are $35 per person and include cocktails and pupus by Tuaca and Nobu Waikiki.</p>

<p>Also on the schedule is “The Little Things in Life,” a lecture with jeffstaple about the who, what, when, where, and why&#8217;s of being an entrepreneur. Ng has successfully integrated design and the printed word in his art and business ventures, and is here to share how. This event, co-sponsored by AIGA Honolulu, is planned for Thursday July 29 at 6:30 p.m., location to be determined. Tickets are $10 purchased in advance, $20 at the door.</p>

<p>Finally, a book talk with aforementioned Hart Wood authors Glenn Mason and Don Hibbard will be held at the Waikiki Parc Hotel on Tuesday, August 3, at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Proceeds from Reed Space HNL events, and all bookstore sales support all Interisland Terminal programs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Reed Space HNL runs from July 29 – August 8, 2010 at the Waikiki Parc Hotel, located at 2233 Helumoa Road.&nbsp; Regular store hours will be 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., daily.</p>

<p>Free, validated valet parking at the Waikiki Parc hotel will be provided for all Reed Space visitors and event attendees.<br />

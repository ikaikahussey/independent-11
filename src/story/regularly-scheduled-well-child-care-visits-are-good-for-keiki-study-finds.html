<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A study of cases involving children in Hawaii, conducted by the University of Hawaii at Manoa&#8217;s John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM), has found that regularly scheduled checkups can reduce the odds that keiki will end up in the hospital.</p>

<p>The checkups, called “well-child care visits,” have been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics since 1967. <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001928.htm" title="Pediatric well-child visits">Pediatric well-child visits</a> are most frequent when the child’s development is most rapid. Each visit includes a complete physical examination to assess the infant or young child&#8217;s growth and development and help identify problems early. Height, weight, and other important information is recorded and considered. Hearing, vision, and other tests also become a part of some visits.</p>

<p>In order to promote preventative care for Hawaii&#8217;s keiki, pediatrician Jeffrey Tom of Kaiser Permanente has published the results of a study conducted with his JABSOM colleagues, Drs. Chien-Wen Tseng and James Davis. The physicians analyzed the billing data of nearly 37,000 local children younger than 3½ over a period of seven years, from 1999-2006.</p>

<p>“We wanted to establish, for the first time, evidence that taking your child to regular well-child care visits can decrease hospitalizations above and beyond seeing the same healthcare provider,” said Tom, who began the study while a research fellow in the medical school’s Department of Pediatrics. “We found the most dramatic affect for children who have chronic diseases, such as asthma. In those cases, timely well-child care visits reduced by half the chance of hospitalization.”</p>

<p>The results are published in November’s <a href="http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/" title="Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine">Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine</a>. The study, supported by grants from the Health Resources and Service Administration and the National Institutes of Health, examined Hawaii children covered by HMSA, Hawaii’s largest private insurer. </p>

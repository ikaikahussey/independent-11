<p>Religious leaders have met privately with state lawmakers to strengthen a <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131004_Religious_leaders_walk_a_political_tightrope_.html?id=226436031">religious</a> exemption in a gay marriage bill. They do not want to publicly undermine their main objective to somehow persuade the Legislature to reject the bill in special session later this month and put the issue before voters.</p>

<p>In light of the upcoming special legislative <a href="http://www.hawaiireporter.com/public-event-scheduled-on-marriage-equality-and-religious-exemptions/123">session</a> scheduled to start on October 28, a symposium on the religious exemptions to the proposed marriage equity bill will be held on Wednesday, October 9, 2013 at the Hawai‘i State Capitol Auditorium beginning at 5:30 p.m. The symposium will broadcast live on ‘Olelo channel 49.</p>

<p>At the end of his life, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had shifted his focus from desegration to the &#8220;giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism.&#8221; In remembrance of his life – and the continuing relevance of his unfinished work – here is an excerpt of his 1967 &#8220;<a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm">Beyond Vietnam</a>&#8221; speech, given exactly one year before his killing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin&#8230;we must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.</p>

<p>A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand, we are called to play the Good Samaritan on life&#8217;s roadside, but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life&#8217;s highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.</p>

<p>A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, &#8220;This is not just.&#8221; It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of South America and say, &#8220;This is not just.&#8221; The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just.</p>

<p>Denny Coffman, a member of the Hawaii State House of Representatives representing the 5th district, submitted his resignation today.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do so for family reasons,&#8221; Coffman writes. He continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I lost my wife of 44 years this summer due to brain cancer. I am now the only parent and grandparent for my daughters and grandchildren. On Saturday, November 17, 2013, I learned that my oldest daughterâ€™s breast cancer has returned and the cancer has spread to several locations in her lymph system. She is facing another big battle with cancer.</p>

<p>With the loss of my wife, I am now mother and father to Amy and she needs my help. While I love Hawaii with all my heart, my love for family must trump my legislative plans. The recession of the past 5 years caused my daughters and grandchildren to leave Hawaii to find employment on the mainland. To help Amy battle her cancer, I too must leave Hawaii.</p>

<p>It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the people of Hawaii. I leave knowing that I have represented the communities of Hawaii Island and the State to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HB&amp;billnumber=1129&amp;year=2015">HB1129</a> seeks to prohibit law enforcement officers from consuming any amount of alcohol while in the possession of a firearm. The measure came as a result of a tragic incident, in which Christopher Deedy, a U.S. State Department special agent, in Hawaii to provide security for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, fatally shot Kollin Elderts in the Kuhio Avenue McDonald&#8217;s restaurant in the early morning of Nov. 5, 2011. He was off duty at the time.<br />
 <br />
The measure was introduced by Rep. Kaniela Ing (Kihei, Wailea, Makena) at the request of the Elderts’ family.<br />
 <br />
&#8220;While no legislation can heal the pain that the Elderts&#8217; family has endured, we need to take action to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future,” Ing said during a press conference held at the Capitol last Friday to call attention to the bill. “No matter where you stand on the Deedy trial, we can all recognize the dangers of carrying a firearm while intoxicated. This is a common sense bill that will save lives.&#8221;</p>

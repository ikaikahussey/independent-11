"teaser":"Andrea Seabrook left NPR in July out of frustration for being \"lied to every day, all day,\" while covering Congress.   \"There is so little genuine discussion going on with the reporters. … To me, as a reporter, everything is spin,\" she told Politico.  Seabrook has created her own <a href=\"http://www.decodedc.com\">blog and podcast</a> to “decipher Washington’s Byzantine language and procedure, sweeping away what doesn’t matter so listeners can focus on what does.\"   I'm looking forward to it.",

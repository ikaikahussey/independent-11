<p>HAWAI‘I ISLAND&#8212;On Wednesday, Hawai‘i Island celebrated the grand opening and dedication of the L?kahi Ka‘u Apartments in Kailua-Kona. The 306-unit affordable housing community is the result of a collaborative partnership between the State, federal government, and the private sector.</p>

<p>L?kahi provides affordable rentals for West Hawai‘i residents who earn 60 percent of the median income and below&#8212;working individuals and families who don’t earn enough to compete in the rental market in the area. </p>

<p>L?kahi Ka‘u is one of nine Hawai‘i Island affordable housing projects that are part of a strategic plan by the Hawai‘i Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HHFDC), the State’s housing finance and development agency, to develop approximately 8,800 affordable units statewide between fiscal years 2007 and 2015.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the past four fiscal years, HHFDC and its partners have completed five of those Hawai‘i Island projects&#8212;adding 520 affordable rental housing units.&nbsp; Statewide, close to 3,300 affordable units have been developed or preserved during this time frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Low income housing doesn’t have to mean low quality housing,” Gov. Linda Lingle said, pointing out L?kahi Ka‘u’s innovative design, quality materials, landscaping, and amenities, as well as solar heating technology and Energy Star appliances.</p>

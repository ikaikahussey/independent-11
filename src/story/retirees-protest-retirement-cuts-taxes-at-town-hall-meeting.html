<p>KITV&#8217;s Catherine Cruz <a href="http://www.kitv.com/politics/26909850/detail.html">reports</a> that a town hall meeting last night provided an opportunity for state retirees to raise issue with the Abercrombie administration&#8217;s planned cuts to the state pension system. Pensions may be taxed, and Medicare Part B reimbursements may be cut.</p>

<p>For more information about the Medicare Part B proposal, see our explanatory coverage <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/over-30000-would-be-affected-by-governors-plan-to-cut-medicare-part-b-reimb">here</a>.</p>

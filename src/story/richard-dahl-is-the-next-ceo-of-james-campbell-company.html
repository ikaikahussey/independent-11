<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;On August 11, the James Campbell Company will bring in a new chief executive officer when Richard Dahl steps in to succeed Board Chairman and CEO Steve MacMillan. Dahl has spent more than 20 years at Bank of Hawaii Corporation, including serving as its president and COO from 1994 to 2002.</p>

<p>“We are very pleased to have Richard Dahl join the James Campbell Company,” said MacMillan in a statement. “Richard has an impressive track record of success, both in Hawaii and the mainland. The board is confident that he is the right person to lead the James Campbell Company to even greater success in the future.”</p>

<p>MacMillan has decided to reture after more than 28-years with the Estate of James Campbell and currently the James Campbell Company</p>

<p>After his time at Bank of Hawaii, Dahl joined Dole Food Company, Inc., and became its president and COO. Dole, founded in Hawaii in 1851, is the largest fresh fruit and vegetable company in the world. </p>

<p>Dahl is also currently the non-executive chairman of the Board of International Rectifier Corporation of El Segundo, California, and is a director of DineEquity, Inc. of Glendale, California and IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company, of Boise, Idaho. </p>

<p>In addition to directing the company’s real estate assets valued at more than $2.6 billion and properties in Washington, D.C. and 16 states across the U.S., Dahl looks forward to overseeing the growth of Kapolei.</p>

<p>“I remember when Kapolei was raw earth and a vision on the drawing board,” said Dahl in statement. “It’s amazing to see how the city has developed and grown over the years, but it’s even more exciting to imagine the dynamic economic center it will be when it’s fully realized. This is a testament to all the truly dedicated people whose vision and hard work made Kapolei the vibrant city it is today. Because of them, Kapolei’s future is very bright, and I’m happy to have the opportunity to be a part of that future.”</p>

<p>On Saturday, September 11, Nextdoor will host Right On, a night of funk grooves and hip hop freestyling featuring some of Honolulu’s most accomplished players in that milieu. The brainchild of veteran funk guitarist Brett Stidham, Right On is a celebration of the good vibes shared when great musicians get together as friends and play for the pure, simple joy of it.</p>

<p>Joining Stidham for Right On will be drummer Jerome james, bassist Susan Copp of Quadrophonix, soundscape engineer and MC Omega Cyx. It seems likely that a host of other notable Honolulu freestylers will also find their way to the stage. </p>

<p>“These guys are all trustworthy musicians,” says Stidham. “You know that they’ll always bring their A-game when they come to play.” </p>

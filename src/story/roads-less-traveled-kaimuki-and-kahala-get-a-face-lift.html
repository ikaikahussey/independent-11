<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;With every election year comes many recurring themes for Hawaii residents: big public promises, front lawn campaign signs, bumper stickers, sign wavers during rush hour traffic ... and lots of big construction projects. </p>

<p>Kaimuki is in the midst of a repaving project. The area affected stretches from approximately 18th Avenue to Kaikoo Place, down into neighboring Kahala. A total of 63 streets in the region will be improved and the work will be carried out in seven phases over an estimated 240 calendar days (five to six months) to reach completion. Currently the project is in its first phase, which began on March 29.</p>

<p>The work primarily consists of reconstructing and resurfacing the asphalt roadway. Additional activities include reconstruction of concrete curbs, gutters, and sidewalks; adjustment of utility manholes; pavement markings; and installation of vehicle loop detectors.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Work on the streets is allowed from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on 18th Avenue, 22nd Avenue, Pahoa Avenue, Elepaio Street, Hunakai Street, and Pueo Street. On the remaining streets, workers can remain until 4:30 p.m. The construction will mostly occur from Monday to Friday, with the possibility of additional work on Saturdays. Private streets that serve 6 or more properties, and are opened to the public (such as 20th Avenue), will have limited paving work performed on them.&nbsp; </p>

<p>On-street parking will be prohibited during working hours, and these will be posted on the streets affected. A failure to heed the signs may result in towing at the owners&#8217; expense. Everyone in the area can expect detours, along with lane and road closures. Local and resident traffic such as deliveries and trash collection will be allowed during construction. People should allow additional travel time while driving through the work areas and expect delays.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The project manager, Jennifer Gallego-Nakamoto of Grace Pacific Corporation, reports that residents have been, for the most part, &#8220;happy and accommodating.&#8221; She says they have been working with the needs of the community to minimize negative impact and are trying to complete the work as quickly as possible. For instance, work in the area around Waialae elementary was delayed in order to work with the school&#8217;s needs. </p>

<p>The positive sentiment Gallego-Nakamoto reports is consistent with the tone of conversations I have had with residents, who are &#8220;happy to see the roads repaired,&#8221; although there also appears to be a mixture of bemusement and annoyance towards the project.</p>

<p>Parking, or a lack thereof, has so far been the largest source of complaints, according to Gallego-Nakamoto. The stretch of 21st Avenue between Harding and Pahoa is where the contractor stages their equipment. Unsurprisingly, this has had a negative impact on nearby residents. In our correspondence, Gallego-Nakamoto stressed her desire to get the community&#8217;s feedback so that Grace Pacific Corporation can make the necessary adjustments to their work if there are complaints.</p>

<p>With over 200 more days of construction to go, residents are sure to chime in soon.</p>

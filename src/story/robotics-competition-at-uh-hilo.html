HILO&#8212;Last month, UH-Hilo hosted the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) competition, which drew 60 teams from all over the world. Alongside student competitors from Russia, China, Canada, Taiwan, and Scotland, five teams represented America’s 50th state. They were Kapiolani Community College, Moanalua High School, Highlands Intermediate School, Kealakehe Intermediate School, and Hilo High School. </p>

<p>When the <i>Youth News for The Hawaii Independent</i> reporters arrived, the British Columbia team had already passed their safety check and had their ROV in the pool. ROV means “remote operated vehicle.” During the time the reporters observed the teams, a total of three ROVs took turns diving, circling, and making other maneuvers all to be sure the equipment would meet the judge’s requirements for these underwater robots. </p>

<p><i>Youth News</i> interviewed students from Florida, who are actively involved in research related to the gulf oil spill. The students are West Florida residents who attend Pine Forest High. They recently used their ROV in a real life situation, collecting oyster clumps before the oil made its way to Pensacola. They talked about how their nice white sands, once a beautiful sight to see, are now all black. The students also said that although they received funds of $5,000 to build their ROV, they really only needed $3,000. The biggest single expense in that budget was their manipulator, which cost $1,000. </p>

<p>Also, on hand were students from Hilo Intermediate who were selling mini ROV kits. Teacher Cindy Fong and her Hilo Intermediate School robotics class organized the sale as a fundraiser for the Hilo team. </p>

<p>The competition ended as the judges announced the winners for the ninth annual ROV event that day. First place went to First Flight High School of Kill Devil Hill, North California. Second place went to Clarenville High School, California. Finally, third place was given to Aptos High School. Though Hilo High School did not place among the top three, they Hilo team was given an award in the Ranger class, winning the “Biggest Bang for the Buck” prize. A team awarded this prize must spend the least money for their ROV.</p>

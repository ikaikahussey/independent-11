<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Honolulu City Councilmember Rod Tam pled guilty today to 26 counts of theft and unsworn falsification.</p>

<p>The Department of the Attorney General filed a complaint earlier this year alleging that Tam, as a Councilmember, submitted false claims for reimbursements of meals during fiscal years 2007-2008 and 2008-2009. Tam knowingly charged the City higher amounts than the actual receipts paid for the meals, and was therefore overpaid in reimbursements, according to the Attorney General.</p>

<p>The amounts of the individual overcharges described in the complaint ranged from $8.00 to $267.55 and were incurred at various restaurants in Honolulu.</p>

<p>Under a plea agreement with the Department of the Attorney General, Tam pled guilty as charged to all 26 counts.</p>

<p>“Mr. Tam violated a public trust, and has now pled guilty to 26 separate crimes,” Attorney General Mark Bennett said. “We believe this is an appropriate resolution to this case.”</p>

<p>Sentencing is scheduled for January 27, 2011, before the Honorable Randal Shintani.</p>

<p>Theft in the Third Degree and Unsworn Falsification to Authorities are misdemeanors punishable by up to one year in jail, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. Theft in the Fourth Degree is a petty misdemeanor punishable by up to thirty days in jail, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.</p>

<p>Tam represents a portion of Makiki, Downtown Honolulu, Punchbowl, Liliha, Pauoa Valley, Nuuanu, Alewa Heights, Papakolea, Kalihi Valley, and a portion of Kalihi.</p>

<p>Tam could not be reached for comment. </p>

<p>The Councilman did issue the following statement this afternoon:</p>

<p>&#8220;At this time, I am responding to petty misdemeanors and misdemeanors charges against me by the State of Hawaii&#8217;s Attorney General Office out<br />
of embarrassment. So that there is no misinterpretation: &#8216;Pursuant to compromise, I have pleaded guilty to a variety of petty misdemeanors and misdemeanors. I submitted vouchers that exceeded actual bill amounts. I also submitted vouchers that were below actual billing amounts. I should have practiced better bookkeeping methods. I take full responsibility and deeply apologize for my mistakes.&#8217;</p>

<p>A court date will be set for sometime in 2011.</p>

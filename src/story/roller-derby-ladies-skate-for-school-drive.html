<p>Pacific Roller Derby has joined the Hawaii Jaycees to support the 4th Annual Adopt A School Day, a statewide grassroots effort to establish awareness and service to Hawaii’s schools. </p>

<p>This call for service hits close to home for the hip-checking rollergirls&#8212;many of whom are mothers and teachers. Rookie rollergirl Kuchi 2Sox is a teacher at Leihoku Elementary school in Waianae. After completing the Pacific’s roller derby boot camp, an intensive 6-to-8 week training program that prepares skaters to pass a required minimum skills test, Kuchi compared student time in the classroom to teacher time on the flat-track.</p>

<p>“I can’t help to think that my kids go through the same thing,&#8221; Kuchi said. &#8220;The same anxiety, the same uncertainty, and the same feeling of excitement and joy when they finally complete a task.”</p>

<p>Kuchi said that roller derby has taught her to be more patient and confident and that the sport reminds her to continue encouraging her own students to do their best.</p>

<p>Skaters will kick off their pledge to support Leeward-based elementary schools by hosting a &#8220;Back to School Daze&#8221; scrimmage and school supply drive this Saturday featuring Lunch Ladies and Gym Teachers in the feared &#8220;roller derby cage&#8221; at The Hideaway Club. Fans are encouraged to bring new or gently used school supplies ranging from pens and pencils to binders, backpacks, and more, to this Saturday’s family friendly event.</p>

<p>Admission is $7 for the general public, $5 for military fans with a valid ID, and free for keiki 12 and under. Non-military fans are required to RSVP at <a href="http://www.pacificrollerderby.com" target="_blank">www.pacificrollerderby.com</a> by midnight on Friday, August 26 to gain access to the Coast Guard Air Station for the afternoon event, or be sponsored by an active military duty member. </p>

<p>Fans are encouraged to bring beach chairs for seating and can enjoy live roller derby, a bake sale, and show league support by purchasing Pacific Roller Derby t-shirts, aprons, and more. Doors open at 3:30 p.m. and the bout begins at 4:00 p.m., followed by live music by local rockers Boy and Sea and Ever After Ever. </p>

<p>The all-ages event turns into an 18-and-up event after sunset, and fans are invited to stay and talk story with their favorite derby girls, referees, and non-skating officials.</p>

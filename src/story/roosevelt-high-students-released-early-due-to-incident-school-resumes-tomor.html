<p>The DOE has issued an official press release regarding the shooting incident today at Roosevelt High School:</p>

<blockquote><p> 01/28/14 </p>

<p>HONOLULU - Roosevelt High ended classes at 10 a.m. today as a result of an incident that placed the school under lockdown earlier in the morning. Classes will resume tomorrow as scheduled. </p>

<p>The lockdown began around 8:30 a.m. when two police officers arrived to escort a 17-year-old reported “runaway” off campus. The male is a non-active student registered at Roosevelt High. According to the Honolulu Police Department (HPD), upon seeing the police officers, the male became combative and brandished a knife, which he used to slash at the officers. One of the officers fired two shots, striking the male once. The male was taken to a hospital in serious condition with non-life threatening injuries. </p>

<p>Parents were immediately notified of the lockdown through the school’s emergency call system. An hour and a half later, the school released students early to allow the HPD to conduct an investigation. Parents and guardians were notified of a student pick-up location. </p>

<p>&#8220;Incidents like this are very rare in Hawaii, however, our partnership with the Honolulu Police Department on safety drills played a major role in the success of today’s lockdown,&#8221; stated Schools Superintendent Kathryn Matayoshi. &#8220;I commend Roosevelt High staff and students for their diligence in following safety protocols, as well as police officers for quickly bringing the situation under control. I also want to thank parents for their patience and understanding during the incident.&#8221; </p>

<p>Complex Area Superintendent Ruth Silberstein added, “Today’s situation was handled in a manner that caused the least disruption on campus and it is a testament to our teachers, faculty and students.” </p>

<p>Roosevelt High will have supports and counselors available to students when classes resume. There are 1,390 students enrolled at Roosevelt High. </p>

<p>All Hawaii State Department of Education schools conduct regular safety drills in coordination with HPD to ensure students and staff are prepared to respond to emergencies.</p>

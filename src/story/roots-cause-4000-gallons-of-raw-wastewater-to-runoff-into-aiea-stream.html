<p>Crews from the Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services responded to 4,875 gallon sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) yesterday evening on Aiea Heights Drive. The call came in at 6:45 p.m. ENV arrived at 7:00 p.m. and secured the site at 8:05 p.m.</p>

<p>Tree roots clogged an 8-inch vitrified clay pipe causing a manhole fronting 99-703 Aiea Heights Drive to overflow and send 4,000 gallons of raw wastewater down the hill to a storm drain fronting 99-730 Holoai Street, which leads to Aiea Stream. Approximately, 875 gallons dissipated into the ground.</p>

<p>ENV notified the state Department of Health. The affected area was cleaned, disinfected and deodorized. Warning signs will be posted and samples collected.</p>

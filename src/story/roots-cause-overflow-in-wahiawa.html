<p>Crews from the city&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services responded to sanitary sewer overflow (SSO), also known as a sewage spill, this evening in Wahiawa.</p>

<p>The call came in on Tuesday, March 2 at 4:35 p.m. ENV arrived at 6:20 p.m. and secured the site at 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Tree roots clogged a 6-inch siphon pipe causing a manhole fronting 77 Karsten Drive in Wahiawa to overflow and send 3,400 gallons of raw wastewater into a dry ravine.&nbsp; There is no public access to the area, and the SSO should not reach the Wahiawa Reservoir.</p>

<p>ENV notified the state Department of Health. The affected area was cleaned and disinfected. Crews will be dispatched to the site to determine if signing and sampling are warranted.</p>

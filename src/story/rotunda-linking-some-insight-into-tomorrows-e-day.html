<p>And here&#8217;s a slice of what&#8217;s been going on leading up to the primaries: <i>The Hawaii Independent</i>&#8216;s recent campaign commentary, candidate interviews, and other handy links to check out before heading to the polls. </p>

First up, <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> columnist and Hawaii Public Radio host Beth-Ann Kozlovich reminds us that while the campaign season is catapulting issues, facts, and insults to front pages and back rooms, these days, it’s tough not to think or be talking about some of them.</p>

With the issues in mind, Jon Letman reported on a discussion on Kauai in August that explored the impacts of a U.S. economy too intensely focused on its military operations overseas. Real security, it was said, will come when Hawaii is not dominated by military spending but instead supports more immediate human needs: health, education, preservation of the environment, sustainable energy, and fostering a culture the builds rather than destroys.</p>

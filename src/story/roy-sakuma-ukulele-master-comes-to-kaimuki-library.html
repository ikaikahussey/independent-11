<p>Kaimuki Library presents &#8220;The Art of the Ukulele with Roy Sakuma&#8221; on Sunday, August 15 at 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Roy Sakuma is recognized as Hawaii’s foremost ukulele teacher, and proponent of the instrument. For over 30 years, Sakuma has been an ukulele teacher, producer, promoter, and inspiration to thousands of students.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, as America’s youth latched onto the larger, louder, more swaggering guitar, the little instrument from Hawaii was relegated to the attic. Sakuma knew the instrument’s true worth. For over 30 years, along with his wife Kathy and their staff of instructors and supporters, Sakuma&#8217;s mission has been to spread the joy of the ukulele, teaching students and promoting the annual Ukulele Festival, the largest ukulele festival of its kind in the world.</p>

<p>The ukulele has come a long way. It’s cool once again to play the ukulele. Youngsters jam at school between classes, at the park, and at the mall. The ukulele embraces everyone who hears it.</p>

<p>As Sakuma understood decades ago, that’s the irresistible charm of the ukulele.</p>

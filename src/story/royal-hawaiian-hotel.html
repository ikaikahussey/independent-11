<p>&#8220;Uluwehiwehi ‘oe i ka‘u ‘ike la, e ka Royal Hawaiian Hotel.&#8221; The 1927 song composed for the opening of the now-pink hotel celebrated the velvet beds, green marble walls, and the arching rainbows of Waikiki of the new hotel. </p>

<p>“If you are going to be very grand, go to the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.&nbsp; It’s quite the last word financially and otherwise.” So proclaimed the pamphlet Highlights on Honolulu (1930).&nbsp; A world-class hotel for a world class destination, the 400 room hotel changed the character of Waikiki forever. </p>

<p>The largest construction project in the Pacific at the time, the $5,000,000 hotel represented a quantum leap for the visitor industry. Its rate of $14 per night in 1929 was 40% higher than its nearest competitor, <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/the-moana-surfrider">the Moana</a>. Guests included the Rockefellers, Fords, du Ponts, Henry J. Kaiser, the Shah of Iran, Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Franklin D. Roosevelt and a host of other celebrities.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Complacency about women’s right to safety; this grave and costly problem warrants increased attention, improved system response and higher community priority for policy makers, decision-makers, funders, businesses, community leaders<br />
 <br />
2.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Women’s right to reproductive freedom<br />
 <br />
3.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Economic Issues keep women living in poverty or dependent on others (pay equity / availability of affordable child care/ cost of higher education/need for affordable housing)<br />

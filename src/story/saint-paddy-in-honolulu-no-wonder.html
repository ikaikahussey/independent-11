<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The biggest Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day celebration in the Pacific is the block party that takes place in Honolulu&#8217;s &#8220;Irish corner,&#8221; at Nuuanu Avenue and Merchant Street. Thousands of hours of planning and labor contribute to an event that lasts less than six hours. </p>

<p>Two days before the largest Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day street festival in the Pacific, it&#8217;s a normal lunchtime at the Irish corner. Only the steel sawhorse blinkers lining the streets hint at anything that might disrupt the smoldering routine of a business district in the daylight. Don Murphy, owner of Murphy&#8217;s Bar &amp; Grill and humble ringmaster of the block party, carefully waters the blooming gardenia hanging from the aged red brick of his establishment&#8217;s erstwhile facade, on a suspect but faithful wooden ladder. Before long, many thousands of people will descend on this corner for food, drink, entertainment, and a cheerful crush of humanity.</p>

<p>But why Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day? Why here? The Irish have figured into the social, political, and economic state of affairs in Hawaii since their arrival, whether that landfall involved religion, colonialism, or flat-out ambition. What does Ireland have to do with Hawaii, anyway? And what does it mean to be Irish in paradise?</p>

<p>&#8220;People think it&#8217;s about drinking,&#8221; says Bill Comerford, co-owner of three Irish pubs in Honolulu. He scratches his whitened beard. Long an advocate for small business rights, Comerford smiles. &#8220;It&#8217;s about community,&#8221; he says. There is no trace of an Irish brogue in his speech.</p>

<p>Because his actual birth-date was unknown and given the choice to choose it, King David Kalakaua chose Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day. One of his closest advisers was an Irishman. Lewers Street in Waikiki, the epicenter of Hawaii tourism, is named for an Irishman. James Dodd, another Irishman, became Honolulu&#8217;s police chief after making a living catching cannon balls with his belly and operating a pub. Names like James Campbell continue to stir controversy in property development rights. Most of Hawaii&#8217;s most laudable political offices have been held by those of Irish descent.</p>

<p>Anecdotes about the Irish in Hawaii abound. But only among those that know them. The Irish have always held the publican, the bar owner, as a revered figure. He or she provides the parlor that hosts the talkers who behave with wit and with wisdom. According to Comerford, &#8220;We are the community&#8217;s living room.&#8221;</p>

<p>As flat-bed trucks assemble on the day before The Day, it&#8217;s all work. A small village of tents springs up in what was yesterday (and tomorrow) a parking lot. Area regulars sneer and gloat at the certainty of a guaranteed bacchanal.</p>

<p>Invaded, conquered, colonized and, finally, imperialized, Hawaii and Ireland share much in common. But, who cares? It&#8217;s Saint Paddy&#8217;s.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;A sand restoration project will be held on Oahu’s famed Makaha Surfing Beach on Monday, August 22 beginning at 8:00 a.m. </p>

<p>State officials said that one of the goals of this project is to help prevent the recurring erosion along the base of the roadway. It is also aimed at ensuring public safety, facilitating access to the beach, restoring a natural beach slope, and helping to protect the existing natural vegetation. The beach has been eroding for years the west end of the beach, threatening the stability of the lifeguard stand, parking lot, and trees. </p>

<p>“Our first priority is to minimize public hazard and improve access to the lifeguard stand and other structures, which are in danger of losing their foundations due to erosion caused by the high surf,” said Sen. Maile Shimabukuro (D), who organized the restoration project. Shimabukuro represents District 21&#8212;Kaena Point, Makua, Makaha, Waianae, Maili, Nanakuli, Kahe Point, Ko Olina.</p>

<p>Heavy equipment will move sand from several parts of the beach to replenish about 3,800 cubic yards of erosion. The City and County of Honolulu’s Department of Facilities Maintenance will conduct the operations under the direction of the City and County of Honolulu’s Parks and Recreation Department.</p>

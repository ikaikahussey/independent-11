<p>Volunteers are still needed to help remove hundreds of pounds of trash at Sandy Beach. The beach clean up organized by Surfrider Foundation and solar integrator RevoluSun takes place on Saturday, July 10 from 10:00 a.m. to noon. </p>

<p>Look for the RevoluSun and Surfrider tents in the park between the lifeguard stand and shower.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Volunteers are asked to bring old plastic bags to gather rubbish and reusable water bottles for hydration. </p>

<p>In addition to the clean up, Surfrider hopes to promote support for clean energy in light of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by partnering with local solar design and installation firm, RevoluSun. </p>

<p>RevoluSun will then host a free barbeque for all volunteers following the clean up.&nbsp; </p>

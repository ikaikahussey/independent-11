<blockquote><p> </p>

<p>Honolulu, HI— Today, the Hawaii Government Employees Association (HGEA) announced it has unanimously endorsed Brian Schatz for United States Senate in 2014. HGEA joins a fast-growing list of grassroots organizations, now totaling 24, supporting Schatz’s candidacy.&nbsp; HGEA is an affiliate of AFSCME and the largest union in the state with over 42,000 members.</p>

<p>“Through his early years at the State Legislature, then as our Lieutenant Governor and now as U.S. Senator, Brian Schatz has had unwavering support for Hawaii’s workers — which is why we have recognized his candidacy with our early endorsement,” said HGEA President Jackie Ferguson-Miyamoto. “Senator Schatz has a perfect voting record on labor issues in Congress and has demonstrated a solid commitment to protecting Social Security and Medicare. His dedication to improving the quality of life for working families is reflected in his leadership and resides in his heart.”</p>

<p>“The two dozen far ranging organizations that have endorsed Brian Schatz show the growing momentum of support for the campaign,” said Bill Meheula, Schatz for Hawaii. “These organizations and their members believe that Senator Schatz shares their values and is a strong leader for today and tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>“This endorsement means a lot to me personally. These are the people who provide critical public services every day, and they represent middle class across Hawaii. They represent clerks, nurses, researchers, cafeteria workers, school principals, and many others. I will continue to fight for working families in the Senate,” said Senator Brian Schatz. “I thank HGEA for standing with me as we work to solve the challenges of our time, including protecting Social Security, creating jobs, growing tourism, and expanding clean energy.”</p>

<p>This endorsement is the 24th formal endorsement for Senator Schatz. He has also received endorsements from: the State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers, the Hawaii Firefighters Association, the National Association of Letter Carriers, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 480, Hawaii Building &amp; Construction Trades Council, Plumbers Local 675, Elevator Constructors Local 126, Drywall, Tapers and Finishers Local 1944, Glaziers Local 1889, Boilermakers Local 204, Painters and Allied Trades Local 1791, IBEW Local 1186, Heat and Frost Insulators Local 132, Teamsters Local 996, Roofers Local 221, Iron Workers Local 625, IBEW Local 1260, University of Hawaii Professional Assembly, League of Conservation Voters, Ocean Champions, Blue America PAC, the National Weather Service Employees Organization, and the Council for a Livable World.</p>

He&#8217;s also received support from the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, and his colleagues, including Majority Leader Harry Reid, Majority Whip Dick Durbin, and Senators Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Schumer.</p>

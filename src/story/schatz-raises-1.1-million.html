<p>The 2014 election season is a little over a year away, which is clear by today&#8217;s <a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/hawaii-schatz-fundraising-sends-message-to-potential-primary-foes/">news</a> that Senator Brian Schatz has raised $1.1 million towards re-election. </p>

<p>This puts him about 1/9 of the way towards raising the <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/09/in<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00001762&amp;cycle=2010">cumbent-campaign-fundraising-advantage-congress&#8221;>2010 national incumbent fundraising average of $9.4 million</a>, or about 1/5 towards the </a>$5,216,102 Senator Inouye raised in 2010.</p>

<p>Roll Call nails it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, is trying to ward off potential primary challengers with hefty first-quarter fundraising and a veteran campaign team already in place for 2014.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rep. Colleen Hanabusa is the most likely primary challenger; and though a recent poll showed that she&#8217;d likely trounce Schatz in a hypothetical election, the $1.1 million to Schatz might convince her to take on Abercrombie, who is regarded by some Democratic leaders as a weak candidate.</p>

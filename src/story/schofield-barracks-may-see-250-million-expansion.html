<p>WAHIAWA&#8212;The Department of Defense is expected to award Schofield Barracks a contract for as much as $250 million in December. A planned expansion of the Central Oahu Army base is part of former President George W. Bush’s Grow the Army (GTA) program, which expects to see an increase of 74,000 troops by 2013. The approximately 18,000 acre base will be expanded with various buildings and infrastructure improvements, as well as an additional 1,680 soldiers.</p>

<p>According to Loran D. Doane, Media Relations Chief for U.S. Army Garrison-Hawaii (USAG-HI), “USAG-HI plans to publicly solicit bids in the coming months for major installation improvements at Schofield Barracks, which will cover building new administrative, operations, and maintenance facilities along with associated infrastructure improvements such as added roadways, power lines, waterlines, sewers and landscaping for several Army units.”</p>

<p>According to the Army, when selecting a contractor, a company’s past performance and capability will be taken into consideration because “all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are considered significantly more important than the price.”</p>

<p>Once the contract is awarded, which the Army said could be anywhere from $100 million to $250 million, work might start as soon as three months and could continue for at least two to three years, Doane said. </p>

<p>“Concerning the reported troop increase at Schofield Barracks, USAG-HI will not see any net increase in soldiers stationed in Hawaii,&#8221; Doane explained on Friday. &#8220;When the construction is finished, we are expected to be able to house 7,809 Single Soldiers on Army installations in Hawaii. This is an increase of 1,680 from our present level and means fewer single soldiers living in diverted family housing on Schofield Barracks and fewer single soldiers living off post.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barracks for the incoming soldiers will be constructed on 25 acres of vacant land in the South Range of Schofield Barracks. According to <a href="GlobalSecurity.org" title="GlobalSecurity.org">GlobalSecurity.org</a>, Schofield Barracks consists of both fee simple and &#8220;ceded&#8221; lands.</p>

<p>According to the Army’s project synopsis on <a href="http://fbo.gov" title="fbo.gov">fbo.gov</a>, the expansion will include:</p>

<p>* An Infrastructure Facilities project&#8212;Design and construction of all roads, shoulders, walks, curbs, gutters, utilities, grading, drainage, and other site improvements required to provide major site and utility infrastructure support to support the three current GTA Campus projects and other future identified facilities. </p>

<p>* A Unit Operations and Maintenance&#8212;Design and construction of one small Brigade Headquarters, one Company Operations Facility (COF) for two companies with covered hardstand, one small Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility (TEMF) to include storage building, a hazardous waste storage building, organizational unit storage facility, organizational vehicle hardstand and one General Purpose Administrative Facility (GPAF). </p>

<p>* A Unit Operations and Maintenance Complex&#8212;Design and construction of one Criminal Investigation Design Command battalion Headquarters bldg with an arms vault and classrooms. The scope also includes one COF for one company with covered hardstand, two small TEMFs to include POL storage bldg, hazardous waste storage bldg, organizational unit storage facility, organizational vehicle hardstand in each TEMF, and one GPAF. </p>

<p>* The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Complex&#8212;Design and construction of one small battalion headquarters, one COF for one company with covered hardstand, a deployment equipment storage bldg, and organizational vehicle parking. </p>

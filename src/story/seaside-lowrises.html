<p>A vestige of a more tranquil Waikiki, the two-story brick Seaside Apartments is the best surviving example of the small, garden court apartments which dotted the neighborhood prior to WWII. Immaculately detailed, the L-shaped ten-unit building, now office and retail space, focuses on a paved brick walled courtyard that is accessed from the street by a moon gate. The cantilevered second story lanai/corridor is embellished by a wrought-iron railing with a foliate pattern entwining upwards to the roof. Fret-work doors and ample sliding windows invite cooling trade winds into the individual units.</p>

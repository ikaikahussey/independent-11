<p>HONOLULU&#8212;As the culmination of weeklong events in conjunction with National Coming Out Day, the Second Annual Honolulu Equality March will take place at the Hawaii State Capitol on Saturday, October 16, from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 pm. Organized by Pride Alliance Hawaii, a local non-profit organization focused on issues of equality, the Honolulu Equality March celebrates the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and allies and pays tribute to those who have been harassed, bullied, or discriminated against because of their sexual orientation.</p>

<p>“While we hoped that last year’s march would be our first and only, we would be naïve to think that discrimination does not exist in this world,” said Van Law, vice president of Pride Alliance Hawaii. “This year, more so than ever, we need to be proud of who we are and renew our commitment to fighting for equality. We cannot forget that wherever there is a rainbow, there is rain. We must always remember the countless tragedies like the ones that have been making recent news.”</p>

<p>The Honolulu Equality March will be followed by a brief rally and slam poetry performance by Darron Cambra of Youth Speaks Hawaii. During the event, participants will have the opportunity to record short videos for the “It Gets Better” Project, an online effort to show LGBT youth that life can and will get better and they are not alone. There also will be a group memorial for people to recognize loved ones who have been bullied or harassed. </p>

<p>Pride Alliance Hawaii president Tara O’Neill encourages participants to reflect on the need to march in 2010. “We march to celebrate being out and proud, the great work we have done, and the progress being made, but also to recognize the harsh reality that many in our community are often bullied, live in fear, and face discrimination daily,” O&#8217;Neill said.</p>

<p>The event is free and open to all, no RSVP is necessary.</p>

<p>Tables and tables of LPs, cassette tapes (remember those?), and stereo equipment â€“ it&#8217;s a dream for collectors and music afficianados.</p>

<p>Last year&#8217;s fair was <a href="http://alohagotsoul.com/2012/08/07/hawaii-record-fair-in-instagram-photos/">enormously popular</a>, so Dennie and Ward of Hungry Ear are bringing it back for an encore. The fair opens on August 11 at the McKinley High School cafeteria, from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Admission for the event is $5, and early-birds can get in at 9:00 am for $10. Get your groove on!</p>

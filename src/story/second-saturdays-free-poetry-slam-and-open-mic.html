<p>The night features the first of six qualifying slams for the GSF, grand slam finals, as well as Serena Simmons, a Wednesday Workshop Chinatown All-Star.</p>

<p>Since late 2008, 16-year-old Simmons has been filling the atmosphere with her emotion soaked poetry, as well as supporting the local slam scene. The Hawaii born poet discovered Youth Speaks two months ago and loves communes, beards, long hair, music, and getting the lead out. Inspired by the feminist movement, music, and psychedelia, Serena currently hangs at Waikiki&#8217;s largest Hippie compound.</p>

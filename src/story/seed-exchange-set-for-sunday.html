<p>Kauai gardeners, farmers and plant lovers will be gathering from noon until 5:00 p.m. on October 11 for the Fourth Biannual Community Seed and Plant Exchange.</p>

<p>Hosted by Regenerations Botanical Garden, Kauai Community Seed Bank, GMO Free Kauai and Kauapea Farms, the event is intended to boost local food production by encouraging the exchange of seeds and plants that are tried and true.</p>

<p>Paramacharya Palaniswami of Kauai?s Hindu Monastery will be the featured speaker, from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., discussing ?Kauai?s Sacred Botanical Gardens: The Joys and Occasional Misadventures of Monks in Nature.? The monks raise nearly all their own food. </p>

<p>Mini-workshops will be held from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. with the actual exchange set for 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. The event will also include music, and food made from local ingredients.</p>

<p>Participants are invited to bring their favorite GMO- and pest-free seeds, plants, and cuttings to share with others. Those who have nothing to share will still be encouraged to bring something home and start growing.</p>

<p>The event will be held at Kauapea Farms, 2671 Kauapea Rd., which lies along the road to the Kilauea Lighthouse. Watch for signs, and carpooling is encouraged due to limited parking.</p>

<p>HONOLULU &#8212; One of Honolulu’s seminal punk rock bands of the early nineties is reuniting at Hawaiian Brian’s on Saturday, October 8. A fixture in Honolulu’s diverse and vibrant indie music scene in the heyday of the nineties, Ira Hayes typified the passion and drive that saw that decade explode with dozens of bands and venues that provided an alternative to the pop, Jawaiian, and rave milieus that dominated the airwaves. Frontman Russell Roper is returning to Hawaii from Wisconsin for the show, after Jason Miller of Hawaiian Express and others managed to raise his airfare.</p>

<p>California punk rockers The Forgotten are headlining the event, with Ira Hayes billed as “Special Guest.” Regardless of where they are billed, Ira Hayes is certain to be the highlight of this one-time-only showcase presentation. Also appearing on Saturday will be 13th Legion, Never Enough, and Mistermeaner. </p>

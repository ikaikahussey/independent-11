<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The State Senate approved Gov. Neil Abercrombie&#8217;s nominees for Hawaii&#8217;s Board of Education on Thursday, April 14.</p>

<p>The diverse group of nominees received encouragement from the Senate on their difficult journey of reshaping Hawaii&#8217;s public education system.</p>

<p>Sen. Jill Tokuda (D) called the new Board members &#8220;true game changers&#8221; and pointed to the intensive interview process over seven hours of hearings.</p>

<p>&#8220;We asked them a lot of questions, and we got a lot of answers,&#8221; Sen. Sam Slom (R) said approvingly. &#8220;We are all rooting for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sen. J. Kalani English (D) pointed to a time in Hawaii&#8217;s history as an independent country when it had a 98 percent literacy rate&#8212;how it was common for the people of Hawaii at that time to speak three languages.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t obtain high literacy rates again,&#8221; English said. The senator went on to challenge the new Board members to go to &#8220;remote areas, places the city tends to forget.&#8221; English said schools like Lanai and Molokai High Schools currently lack the most basic needs for educating its students.</p>

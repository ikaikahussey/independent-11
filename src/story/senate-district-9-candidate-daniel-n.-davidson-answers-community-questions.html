<p><b>Why are you running for office?&nbsp; What is the single most important issue for your constituents?&nbsp; What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
I am running for office because I feel a need to get involved in the political process, as I feel a certain amount of discontent and frustration in myself and others, and a resulting desire for change. Rather than just criticize and feel helpless, I have decided to run myself. I believe the most important issue currently faced is the state of the economy. Some signs point to recovery, but we are not out the woods yet. I would implement some changes to budgetary and fiscal policy to try to solve the problem in ways that have not been put to the test adequately yet. This would include more accountability and less wasteful spending.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor? Who do you plan on including in your staff?</b><br />
As for my campaign and staff, it is a very small operation, with the bulk of the spending so far coming out of my own pocket. I have a campaign manager and treasurer, but am mostly running the campaign by myself. I would have to evaluate possible candidates to see who would be best suited to include in my staff once elected.</p>

<p><b>What’s your strategy in dealing with the &#8220;homeless&#8221;?</b><br />
With regard to the homeless in Hawaii, I believe the State and counties need to work together better to look at ways to provide human services, including more temporary shelters, while helping the &#8220;homeless&#8221; transition to work. This could include more and better career search and training programs and resources.</p>

<p><b>What’s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
On rail, this is mostly a City and County of Honolulu issue, but the State needs to help facilitate the project however it can. With the small GET increase now in place and ample federal funding assistance, I believe Hawaii can afford it, and should build the rail as a wise infrastructure investment. </p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for House Bill 444?</b><br />
I am a big believer in civil rights, but have reservations about allowing civil unions, which seem tantamount to gay marriage. I would have to further consider and evaluate the matter, but likely would have voted against &#8220;HB444.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Do you support the Akaka Bill?</b><br />
As for the Akaka bill, I certainly believe in some sort of government program allowing for Native Hawaiian recognition and self-determination, but would need to further research and evaluate the legislation.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
It is important to get Hawaii residents more active in the elections process, as the State has had among the lowest voter turnouts in the last few elections.&nbsp; More and better news coverage convincing citizens that current issues and elections are relevant to them is one way we could possibly achieve this goal.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii’s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Helping small businesses is important, with such making up a sizeable part of the State&#8217;s economy. Not raising the general excise tax any further, as has been repeatedly proposed, is one way to help small businesses stay afloat. Other programs and economic incentives, such as tax subsidies, could also be put to the task.</p>

<p><b>How do we solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem?</b><br />
Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem is not as bad as that of the country as a whole, but remains somewhat higher than in past years. Implementing some of the economic measures discussed above to stimulate the economy should help to solve the unemployment problem somewhat, as should the proposal to improve job-seeker services and resources.</p>

<p>“Thanks to Brian’s visionary leadership, Hawaii implemented its own groundbreaking Clean Energy Initiative. As a result, Hawaii has tripled its renewable energy production from 6 percent to 18 percent,” Gore said in a statement on Sunday. “And we’re going to need Brian’s strong, outspoken leadership in Congress for many more years to get the job done.”</p>

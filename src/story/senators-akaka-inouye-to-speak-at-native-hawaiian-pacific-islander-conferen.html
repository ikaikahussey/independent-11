<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The <a href="http://www.hawaiiancouncil.org/" target="_blank">Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement </a>(CNHA), a Native Hawaiian advocacy organization, will host its 10th Annual Conference at the Hawaii Convention Center from August 22 to 25. U.S. Senators Daniel Akaka and Daniel Inouye are both scheduled to speak on economic, social, and cultural issues.</p>

<p>The annual convention brings together cultural organizations, homestead and civic groups, educational organizations, and social justice and business firms to focus on the top solutions and pathways to create greater prosperity for native Hawaiians.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As part of the convention’s four days, Hawaiians have teamed up with other Pacific Islander organizations to present a Pacific Islander Philanthropy Forum co-hosted by <a href="http://www.fordfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Ford Foundation</a> Chairwoman Irene Hirano Inouye and the Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/aapi" target="_blank">White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders</a>&#8216;s Executive Director Kiran Ahuja.</p>

<p>The theme of the 10th annual convening is “Community Leaders &amp; Solutions&#8212;Where Success Happens”, setting the tone for the convention week that will cover topics of interest to a broad spectrum of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander leaders.</p>

<p>Featured speakers presenting throughout the four-day include:</p>

<p><strong>Sen. Daniel Akaka</strong>, Chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs;</p>

<p><strong>Sen. Daniel Inouye</strong>, Chair of the Senate Appropriates Committee;</p>

<p><strong>Territory of Guam Senator BJ Cruz</strong>, a Chamorro policy leader and cultural practitioner;</p>

<p><strong>Hawaiian Homes Commission Chairman Alapaki Nahale-a</strong>;</p>

<p><strong>Alaska Federation of Natives President Julie Kitka</strong>;</p>

<p><strong>Former Osage Nation Tribal Chairman Jim Gray</strong>;</p>

<p><strong>Asian American Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy&#8217;s Peggy Saika</strong>;<br />
 <br />
“Our board of directors dedicates all of our staff resources to this convening every year because we know, as Native Hawaiian organizations ourselves, that when leaders make time to connect, great things are possible, and do indeed happen,” said Alvin Parker, CNHA Board Chairman and Principal of the <a href="http://www.kawaihona.org/" target="_blank">Ka Waihona o ka Na&#8217;auao Public Charter School</a>.&nbsp; “This year, we are excited to make stronger connections to the larger Pacific Islander community, as we continue to do with the Native people in Indian Country and Alaska. The convention is a time of year that leaders are able to step back from the day-to-day operations, and strategize, envision and partner with other leaders working in their fields or complimentary fields.”</p>

<p>On Monday, August 22 at noon, a convention press conference will be held to outline the impact of the Native Vote in Hawaii and other states around the country on the 2012 elections.</p>

<p>Na Mea Hawaii and the Native Hawaiian Economic Alliance are coordinating a free marketplace at the convention open to the public between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. August 23 to 25.</p>

<p>Sponsors and partners of the conference include the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.</p>

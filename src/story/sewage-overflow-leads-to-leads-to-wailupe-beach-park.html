<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Crews from the City’s Department of Environmental Services responded to a sanitary sewer overflow yesterday evening in the Wailupe area.</p>

<p>ENV took the call at 4:00 p.m., arrived at 5:05 p.m., and secured the site at 5:40 p.m.</p>

<p>Roots clogged an 8-inch vitrified clay pipe causing a manhole fronting 5197 Poola Street to overflow and send 4,500 gallons of untreated wastewater into a storm drain that leads to Wailupe Beach Park. An additional 1,500 gallons dissipating into the ground. The public is advised to stay out of the water until warning signs are removed.</p>

<p>ENV notified the State Department of Health. The affected area was cleaned, disinfected and deodorized. Warning signs and water sampling will begin at first light on Wednesday morning.</p>

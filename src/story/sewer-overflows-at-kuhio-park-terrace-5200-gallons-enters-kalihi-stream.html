<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) responded this morning to a sanitary sewer overflow at Kuhio Park Terrace.</p>

<p>The call came in at 11:34 a.m., an ENV crew arrived at 11:58 a.m. and secured the site at 1:50 p.m.</p>

<p>Rocks and paper towels clogged an 8-inch terra cotta pipe causing 5,400 gallons of untreated wastewater out a manhole at 2128 Kealoha Place. An estimated 5,200 gallons entered Kalihi Stream, which leads to Keehi Lagoon, while 200 gallons dissipated into the ground.</p>

<p>ENV cleaned, disinfected and deodorized the area and notified the state Department of Health. Signing and water sampling are underway.</p>

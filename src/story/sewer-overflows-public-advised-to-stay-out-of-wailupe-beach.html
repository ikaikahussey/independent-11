<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Crews from the City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) responded to a sanitary sewer overflow Thursday evening on Poola Street in the Wailupe area.</p>

<p>ENV took the call at 6:00 p.m., arrived at 6:55 p.m., and secured the site at 8:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Roots clogged an 8-inch vitrified clay pipe causing a manhole fronting 5231 Poola Street to release 4,550 gallons of raw wastewater out a manhole. Approximately 3,500 gallons made its way to a storm drain leading to Wailupe Beach Park with the remaining 1,050 gallons dissipating into the ground. The public is advised to stay out of the water.</p>

<p>ENV notified the state Department of Health. The affected area was cleaned, disinfected, and deodorized.&nbsp; Warning signs and water sampling will began at first light on Friday morning.</p>

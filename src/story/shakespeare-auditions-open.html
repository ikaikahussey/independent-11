<p>The Hawaii Shakespeare Festival is holding four days of open auditions for its twelfth season. Auditions will be held on Sunday, April 21 from 1pm to 4pm at the Paliku Theatre at Windward Community College; on Monday, April 22 from 6pm to 9pm in the Lab Theatre at Leeward Community College; on Tuesday, April 22 from 6pm to 9pm in the new dance building at the University of Hawaii at Manoa; and on Saturday, April 27 from 1pm to 4pm at The ARTS at Marks Garage.</p>

<p>The twelfth season will feature Troilus and Cressida, directed by R. Kevin Garcia Doyle; Timon of Athens, directed by Tony Pisculli and Eleanor Svaton; and As You Like It, directed by Taurie Kinoshita. Performance dates run from July 19 to September 1 at The ARTS at Marks Garage. Note that Timon of Athens will feature gender-blind casting. There may be some limited cross-casting in the other two plays.</p>

<p>With this season, the Hawaii Shakespeare Festival completes the canon - all 38 of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays in twelve years. The Festival will continue, but next year&#8217;s season is a surprise (for now).</p>

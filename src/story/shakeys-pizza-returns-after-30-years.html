<p>WAIPAHU&#8212;Driving through Waipahu Town, you find yourself passing by dozens of colorful fast food restaurants and local eateries that have lasted through the years. Names like Leeward Drive-Inn, Poke Stop, and Tanioka&#8217;s are neighborhood staples. A stop by Waipahu Town Center, however, will bring you something new&#8212;and old.</p>

<p>The California-based Shakey&#8217;s Pizza Parlor opened its doors in Waipahu on February 24.</p>

<p>After a 30-year hiatus, the national pizza chain has returned to Hawaii. Shakey&#8217;s first came to Hawaii in 1964 and was a popular place for friends and family to get together, enjoy some pizza, cold drinks, and music. </p>

<p>Being unfamiliar with the restaurant myself, I looked one generation ahead to ... my mom, who remembers Shakey&#8217;s as being a &#8220;happening place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a place to hangout after school, eat pizza, and talk story,&#8221; said Norma &#8220;Mom&#8221; Zavala, who frequented the pizza parlor when she was in high school. &#8220;It was a fun environment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first Shakey&#8217;s was located in Waimalu, with a pub feel and live banjo music. The banjo music was started by Shakey&#8217;s founder Sherwood Johnson. Johnson was a talented banjo player and later inducted into the Banjo Hall of Fame. He turned a grocery store into a pizza-serving pub in 1954 that would feature the who&#8217;s who of banjo players and musicians. Shakey&#8217;s would later expand from its Waimalu location to Kaneohe, Waipahu, and in town near Ala Moana. Three decades ago, however, the owner of Shakey&#8217;s in Hawaii sold the franchise, which ended in bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Walk into Shakey&#8217;s today and you are reminded quickly of the emphasis on family, friends, and good times. There are big tables to share pizza, fried chicken, and their famous &#8220;Mojo&#8221; potato fries. There&#8217;s also a game room, big TV screens for sports, and beer (coming soon). Shakey&#8217;s embraces the idea of uniting family and friends around a meal&#8212;something that&#8217;s a lost art in today&#8217;s fast paced, time-starved world. </p>

<p>&#8220;It was a very social, friendly atmosphere. It was the place to go when you didn&#8217;t have anything to do and were just looking to hang out,&#8221; Mom said. &#8220;We could always rely on that place being a spot to go to. It&#8217;s great that the reopened for younger generations to go to now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Waipahu location is only the start of a resurgence in Hawaii and nationally for the pizza parlor chain. Franchisee Brad Vandeman has plans to open two more throughout the state over the next few years.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Hawaii farmers forced to deal with the high cost of transporting their goods to market may be eligible for federal relief from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>The Reimbursement Transportation Cost Payment Program for Geographically Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers (RTCP) assists farmers and ranchers in Hawaii and other geographically disadvantaged areas located outside of the contiguous 48 states.</p>

<p>The Agricultural, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 (2010 Agricultural Appropriations Bill) provided $2.6 million for this Farm Bill program in fiscal year 2010. </p>

<p>Sign-up for RTCP will begin on August 2, 2010, and end on September 10, 2010. </p>

<p>Applicants must file their RTCP application for benefits with their local Farm Service Agency county office no later than Sept. 10, 2010.&nbsp; Applicants have until Nov. 1, 2010, to provide documentation supporting shipping cost claims in fiscal year 2010 to the FSA county office. </p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The fatal shooting of a Kailua man this weekend has left Hawaii residents shocked and concerned about the growing presence of armed personnel here in Honolulu for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. Kollin Kealii Elderts, 23, was shot and killed on the night of Saturday, November 5 at a McDonald&#8217;s restaurant in Waikiki. Christopher Deedy, 27, a special agent with the State Department, has been charged with second-degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of a felony. Deedy was released Monday after posting $250,000 bail.</p>

<p>The shooting at a McDonald&#8217;s in Waikiki comes just as international public relations efforts will be at its highest&#8212;days before leaders from throughout the borders of the Pacific are set meet in Honolulu for APEC. </p>

<p>Speculation over the details from the shooting is generating further tension in the islands. Road closures and high security have already raised concerns for Honolulu residents and commuters. Local groups organizing to speak out against globalization and militarization have already planned rallies and protests during the APEC proceedings.</p>

<p>A march and protest titled &#8220;Justice for Kollin Elderts&#8221; has been scheduled by Hawaii Peace &amp;â€ˆJustice and World Can&#8217;t Wait for this afternoon, Tuesday, November 8. </p>

<p>Participants in the march will gather at Old Stadium Park at 3:45 p.m. and begin marching at 4:00 p.m. Marchers plan to head from King Street to McCully Shopping Center, and then to the front of the Hawaii Convention Center.</p>

<p>A message calling for Hawaii residents to rally in the name of Elderts circulated the Internet, stating: &#8220;That thousands of security agents, police and military personnel are armed to the teeth to protect the rich and powerful, unleashing an atmosphere of fear and terror throughout Hawaii is an outrage! We cannot allow the U.S. State Department, the HPD, the State and City governments, and the media to continue to keep this blatant murder shrouded in secrecy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Police are still investigating the shooting.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;This holiday season, I decided that my gift-giving ritual would be fun, affordable, and stress free. I mean, why shouldn&#8217;t it be?&nbsp; So, keeping that idea in mind, I ferreted out some unique, budget-friendly presents for everyone on your list. The first several suggestions are edible&#8212;the rest run the gamut from jewelry to books. What do these gifts have in common? They are all locally designed or made, they are all under $60, many can be purchased online, and none necessitates a trip to the mall.</p>

<p>Hawaii food gifts now extend way beyond macadamia nuts. There are now a host of artisinal products available at farmers markets, high-end grocery stores, and online. These gifts are perfect for anyone who enjoys good food and drink. </p>

<p><b>Maile Kai Chocolates</b><br />
Fine chocolate is always appreciated and <a href="http://www.maliekai.com" title="Malie Kai Chocolates">Malie Kai Chocolates</a> from the Waialua Estate on Oahu&#8217;s North Shore deliver some of the finest I&#8217;ve tasted. I&#8217;m usually strictly a dark chocolate kind of girl, but their rich milk chocolate packs a serious chocolate punch. Their beautifully packaged bars can be purchased three for $10 at the Kapiolani Community College&#8217;s farmers market. They are also available at R. Field and Whole Foods.</p>

<p><b>Kaiulani Spices</b><br />
<a href="http://www.kaispices.com" title="Kaiulani Spices">Kaiulani Spices</a> will add spice to any gourmet&#8217;s life. Her Kona coffee rub and curry powders are both standouts, the former being a key ingredient in delicious Kona coffee burgers with wasabi mayo, the latter central to a tasty fried rice. You can purchase these as well as her Chinese 5 spice and Hawaiian spice in a four-spice gift pack for $23.</p>

<p><b>Honolulu Gourmet Foods</b><br />
<a href="http://www.honolulugourmetfoods.com" title="Honolulu Gourmet Foods">Honolulu Gourmet Foods</a> is also offering a holiday package. Pick any two of their delicious salad dressings, gift wrapped, for $12. The mango and papaya seed variety adds a bright note to any salad and tastes like pure Hawaii. Even better, salad dressings are a nice antidote to all the rich food gifts typically received this time of year.</p>

<p><b>Aikanae Kona Coffee</b><br />
Thinking about sending Kona coffee to your java addicts on the mainland? Check out <a href="http://www.aikanekonacoffee.com" title="Aikanae Kona Coffee">Aikanae Kona Coffee</a>. Growers Tom and Allan are offering a holiday special of free shipping on domestic orders totaling two and a half pounds or more. They offer a wide range of estate grown, handpicked, custom-roasted beans at an affordable price.</p>

<p><b>Koloa Rum</b><br />
Lucky lushes of Kauai rejoice! You can now buy local K?loa Rum from the new tasting room at the <a href="http://www.koloarum.com" title="Historic Kilohana Plantation">Historic Kilohana Plantation</a> just outside Lihue. An offshoot of Hawaiian Kukui of jam and syrup fame, the Koloa Rum Corporation makes gold ($30.95), dark ($32.95), and white ($29.95) rums from locally-sourced Kauai sugarcane in their Kalaheo production facility, the site of both their distillation and bottling efforts. Currently, the spirits can only be purchased on site but Kamaaina get a 10 percent discount. Too bad that doesn&#8217;t cover the airfare these days. The good news is that KRC plans to distribute to other islands&#8212;both through restaurants and bar accounts and in liquor stores&#8212;early next year.</p>

<p><b>Puka shell bangles by Erin Austin Designs</b><br />
Brand new to the Oahu jewelry scene are fabulous Puka shell bangles in sterling ($28) or gold ($54) by Erin Austin Designs.

<p><b>My Little Secret</b><br />

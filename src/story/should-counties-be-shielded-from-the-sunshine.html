<p>Ian Lind summarizes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HB2157 would advance the date on which a public official has to resign from their current office in order to run for a different position. Currently, resignation is required once the official files as a candidate for the new position. HB2157 would move that forward to the date when the new campaign is required to register with the Campaign Spending Commission, which must be within 10 days of receiving contributions or making expenditures of more than $100. It could require a public official to resign a year or more in advance of the candidate filing deadline.</p>

<p>A second bill, HB259, would prohibit using an elected officials campaign war chest in a run for another elective office without written consent from each donor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bills will be heard in capitol room 325 today at 2:00 pm.</p>

<p>&#8220;If stepped-up enforcement is the answer to bringing down the numbers, then why does HPD only increase enforcement when deaths increase, and then slack off later? What about more police, at more intersections, on a regular basis?</p>

<p>I live very near one of the intersections that the AARP considers to be one of the most dangerous. I have NEVER (shouting in caps) seen police stationed there giving out tickets to the numerous drivers who speed through a right turn without stopping or signaling. The police are not there during morning or evening rush hours when the intersection is jam-packed with stopped cars, forcing pedestrians to weave their way around the vehicles in the crosswalk and making it impossible for those with walkers, wheelchairs or scooters to cross at all.&#8221;</p>

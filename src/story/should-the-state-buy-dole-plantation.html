<p>Senator Dela Cruz — Mr. Central Oahu — has introduced a new resolution urging the state to purchase 22,500 acres of unused Oahu agricultural lands which are being sold by Dole Food Company.</p>

<p>The resolution, <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2013/Bills/SR133_.HTM">SR133</a>, hasn’t been scheduled for any hearings, though the deadline for resolutions is still a few weeks out.</p>

<p>The state recently acquired the <a href="http://galbraith.ilind.net/blog/">Galbraith estate</a>. Should the Dole lands be next?</p>

<div class="correction">Corrected on March 27 to clarify that Dole Plantation itself is not included in the parcels being sold.</div>

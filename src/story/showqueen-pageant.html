<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The 2010 Universal Showqueen Pageant (USQ), which celebrates the art of drag and female impersonation, proved to be a night full of extravagance, glamour, and drama. Whether it was the movie <I>Avatar</I> being brought to life on stage or a flying-showgirl costume, the night was full of surprises at the Hawaii Convention Center.</p>

<p>Saturday night&#8217;s winner, Perla Welch from Portland, was also surprise for some&#8212;as she was neither a division winner nor a crowd favorite&#8212;but still had what it took to come out on top. </p>

<p>“The level of competition was much higher and stronger this year,&#8221; Desiree St. Tropez, co-producer of the pageant. &#8220;The contestants seemed really focused in what they wanted to do and what they wanted to present. I’m happy that the girls came to perform and participate.”</p>

<p>There were a total of nine contestants this year from both Hawaii and the continental United States. Top honors went to the following contestants:&nbsp; first runner-up Sunny Dee-Lite from New York, second runner-up Christina Maria Ashton from Honolulu and third runner-up Jaiyah West-Williams from Honolulu. Also competing were Selena D’Angelo from Las Vegas, Miya Dezanero from Honolulu, Larissa Ashton from Honolulu, Sophia Luciano from Honolulu, and Lupita Amparo from Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Out of the four divisions (Black and White Couture, Evening Gown, Talent, and Showgirl Costume), Sunny Delite took both Black and White Couture and Evening Gown. The Talent division went to Selena D’Angelo and the Showgirl Costume went to Jaiyah West-Williams.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>Contestants each spend months preparing for the pageant and work painstakingly to put together their elaborate costumes.</p>

<p>“It was actually a very stressful and long process,&#8221; said Jaiyah West-Williams. &#8220;I’ve been preparing for this pageant for nine months. I had my ideas set, but things happened and my ideas had to evolve. I don’t think people can comprehend how much work and money goes into this pageant. I’m just glad that I placed, because there was lot of tough competition this year. I don’t have any remorse about running the pageant.&nbsp; I’m going to try again next year,” said West Williams. </p>

<p>Interestingly enough, all of the top-placing contestants were first-time competitors in this year&#8217;s pageant. For the winner, Perla Welch, this was her sixth year running in the pageant. Prior to this year, she hadn’t placed in the pageant. Co-host Dina Jacobs and 1994 USQ explained that it was all about consistency with Perla Welch&#8217;s win and that she had placed high in all the categories. </p>

<p>St. Tropez added: “Some people weren’t happy with the outcome, but what really matters is what the judges come up with and how they interpret the contestants. Everyone has their favorites, but of course, there’s only one winner. You have to respect that.” </p>

<p>Among the judges, this year, were former KITV Sports Anchor Shawn Ching, Kumu Hula and Entertainer Kealii Reichel, Hawaii News Host Steve Uyehara, TV personality Emme Tomimbang, Las Vegas headliner Lani Misalucha, and Miss Hawaii USA 2010 Renee Nobriga. </p>

<p>Regardless of the outcome, the competition among contestants in this year’s pageant proved to be entertaining for the thousands in attendance. </p>

<p>“This year&#8217;s competition was extremely tough,&#8221; USQ videographer and DVD Executive Producer Brent Anbe said. &#8220;You could see in each category that every contestant was ‘in it to win it.’ It was one of the most unpredictable USQ competitions in recent years. Overall, the pageant continued in the tradition of the USQ pageantry, which is a lot of glamour, beauty, fashion, poise, talent, and extreme creativity.” </p>

<p>You may have seen these signs, urging Native Hawaiians to register for the <a href="http://kanaiolowalu.org">Native Hawaiian Roll</a>.</p>

<p>The signs were rented from Safety Systems Hawaii, at a price of $200 per day each. An OHA spokesperson said that they were placed on private lands. On the Kualaka‘i Parkway in Kapolei, for example, they&#8217;re located on Kapolei Community Development Corporation lands.</p>

<p>Joe Kūhiō﻿ Lewis, a lead organizer for OHA of the enrollment effort, is a board member of that Kapolei organization. And though he wasn&#8217;t available for comment, an OHA spokesperson told the Independent that the signs would be coming down tonight.</p>

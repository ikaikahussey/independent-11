<p>The seminal 1980s two-tone ska band English Beat will perform at SoHo on Sunday, March 6. Formed in Birmingham, England in 1978, the band released three studio albums before a breakup in 1983. Their first hit was a cover of the Motown classic “Tears of a Clown,” but their original songs, such as “Mirror in the Bathroom,” “Hands Off She’s Mine,” and “Twist and Crawl” became the instant classics that various incarnations and reformations of the original outfit have been touring behind for decades. </p>

<p>Original vocalist and songwriter Dave Wakeling, who enjoyed success with General Public after the 1983 breakup, is behind the band&#8217;s most popular songs and is back with the band. </p>

<p>Also performing on March 6 will be Go Jimmy Go, Hawaii’s international ska and rock steady kings. The band plans to disband later this year. Paired with English Beat, this could well prove to be one of the most memorable ska shows ever in Honolulu. Also on the bill for the concert is Hell Caminos, DJ Vegas Mike, and Cherry Blossom Cabaret.</p>

<p>Singer/songwriter Stephen Inglis, whose <em>Slackin’ On Dylan</em> album has won the 2011 Hawaii Music Award for Folk Album of the Year, will perform at Ward’s Rafters on Saturday, April 16 at a solo concert that will bring a blend of traditional Hawaiian slack key guitar and the artist’s own folk and kihoalu compositions to the intimate residential Kaimuki venue. It’s safe to assume that some of his deft interpretations of Dylan will also be shared.</p>

<p>Inglis is recently back from Austin, Texas, where he performed at the <a href="http://www.redgorillamusic.com" target="_blank">Red Gorilla Music Festival</a>. He will perform for Lei Day, May 1 at the California Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Inglis has played regularly with other slack key luminaries such as Dennis Kamakahi and Makana.</p>

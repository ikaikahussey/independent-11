<p>HONOLULU&#8212;&#8220;I remember pointing at that gorgeous marquee and saying &#8216;One day I&#8217;m gonna do a show there,&#8217;&#8221; says Bridget Gray, her name flashing across the front of the historic Hawaii Theatre in Downtown Honolulu. She beams as other events cycle on. &#8220;I should get a picture with my name.&#8221; </p>

<p>For Gray, a 3-time Los Angeles Grand Slam Champion and 2-time performer on HBO&#8217;s Def Poetry, that day comes on Friday, September 3, with the debut of the Hawaii Theatre Slam. Along with co-hosts Travis T and Jesse Lipman, the new event offers a second monthly venue for competing poets, and perhaps a second squad of local performers for the annual National Poetry Slam. </p>

<p>Scheduled as an on-going series for select first Fridays, Hawaii Theatre Slam is seeking to offer something a little different from other events that take place on that night. </p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally, we are looking to add to the art scene that is already thriving on that night by bringing a regular poetry spot into the mix,&#8221; Gray says. &#8220;Plus it&#8217;s free!&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>In addition to the venue, Hawaii Theatre Slam differentiates from past and present poetry events in other ways, the first being a firm cap on performers. Sign-up begins at 6:30, half-an-hour before the event, and closes immediately after 15 poets are named. While this places a limit on the amount of poets who get to take the stage, it assures that every poet who signs up will have time to speak. </p>

<p>The competition is open to all to perform their original poems for cash prizes and opportunities to perform at future shows at the Hawaii Theatre. September&#8217;s grand prize includes $100 dollars and a chance to help shape the character of the event as it moves forward. </p>

<div class="pull-gold">&#8220;Along with all the other spoken word artists and organizers, we are ready to grow again.&#8221;</div>

<p><br />
&#8220;Each slam has its own personality,&#8221; says co-host Jesse Lipman, &#8220;and we will develop that. A lot of it will come from the poets that are there.&#8221; </p>

<p>For Lipman, recognized as the godfather of Hawaii slam poetry, Hawaii Theatre Slam marks a reunion with a community he helped create. </p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s feels great,&#8221; Lipman says, &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to be back. It&#8217;s unique to have three veteran poets and MCs collaborate and share the limelight, to build a solid foundation, with good connections to poets both locally and nationally.&#8221; He continues, &#8220;It&#8217;s also a very prestigious location. A lot of great acts have come through and it&#8217;s amazing to be in a quality space and have the support of the theatre behind us. It&#8217;s great to see them reaching out to the poetry audience.&#8221; </p>

<p>The success of Youth Speaks Hawaii and Hawaii Slam has made Honolulu into a nationally respected location for spoken word artists. The new slam hopes to contribute to and compliment the growth experienced within the community since Lipman&#8217;s own WordStew series in the early 2000&#8217;s. </p>

<p>&#8220;It was never my intention to start a slam scene in Honolulu,&#8221; says Lipman, &#8220;but audiences really took to those early underground slams. Then Kealoha and Hawaii Slam blew up and gave Hawaii a national presence. With the work that the Youth Speaks mentors and youth have done, along with all the other spoken word artists and organizers, we are ready to grow again.&#8221; </p>

<p>Gray adds, &#8220;We hope to add another quality poetry event to Honolulu and give the amazing talent pool we have here a variety of opportunities and stages to perform on. It&#8217;s been great to see the poetry slam community come together to make this a success.&#8221; </p>

<p>While the event currently as no date yet scheduled for October but a commitment for at least six first Fridays and firm dates for November and December already in place, Gray is confident that the new event will continue. </p>

<p>&#8220;If the theatre is already booked for another show, I will do my best to get an alternative date for that month,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But Hawaii Theatre has been kind enough to offer an outstanding venue and event staff, so we can&#8217;t argue with that.&#8221; </p>

<p>Promised a gorgeous venue, willing staff, and the theatre&#8217;s full support, the hosts are eager to see what the future will hold for Hawaii Theatre Slam. </p>

<p>&#8220;We have two rather contradictory goals,&#8221; Lipman says, &#8220;First, to have fun with a lot of feedback from the audience, a lively and exciting show, maybe noisier than other events people have gone to at the Theatre. Second, a lot of transparency on the scores and the rules. So we want it to be very official, but mixed with silliness.&#8221; </p>

<p>Gray adds: &#8220;Right now we are upstairs in the Weyand Room, but eventually, I would love to grow so big we have to move into the main theatre, maybe produce a major poetry show, like Def Poetry Jam did on Broadway.&#8221; She smiles with the same giddiness when she first saw her name on the marquee. </p>

<p>&#8220;My dreams are grand,&#8221; Gray says as she pauses to look over the exterior of the theatre again, &#8220;kinda like the Hawaii Theatre.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Slow Art Friday&#8217;s Pauahi Street Party takes over Downtown tonight featuring live harp music and a participatory Hoola Hoop Brigade, and flame working by Hawaii Glass Artists. Sip from handmade sake cups by Hawaii Craftsmen, and micro-brewed beers from The ARTS at Marks Garage. Also sample organic food and wine from Brasserie du Vin; vintage recipes from Soul de Cuba, Kava from Ong King Art Center, and scrumptious desserts from Otto Cake.</p>

<p>There will be a 35-foot table in the middle of the street to relax at with canvas tablecloths and candlelight in front of The ARTS at Marks Garage, next to Hawaii Theatre, between Bethel and Nuuanu. </p>

<p>Slow Art Friday happens every third Friday evening of the month in Chinatown. Inspired by the international â€œSlow Movement,&#8221; Slow Art Friday does not replace First Friday, but provides an alternative, pedestrian-friendly experience while keeping our money in our local economy. Slow Art Friday is an answer for those who feel that First Friday is too hectic. </p>

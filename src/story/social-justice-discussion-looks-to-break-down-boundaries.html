<p>What does it mean to “eliminate boundaries?” How can we come together to implement the change that we want to see? Why is it important that we build alliances? What can you do? Students, teachers, and community leaders are looking to tackle those questions.</p>

<p>The University of Hawaii at Manoa&#8217;s Ethnic Studies Department and Women&#8217;s Studies Program presents &#8220;Social Justice and Grassroots Organizing: Eliminating Boundaries&#8221; on Wednesday, April 27 at 2:00 p.m. in Krauss Hall 012 on the UH Manoa campus.</p>

<p>The discussion aims to teach about &#8220;real issues happening in Hawaii&#8221; and what community members are doing to speak up and fight back.</p>

<p>Topics include housing foreclosures, transgender issues, civil unions, and jobs.</p>

<p>Panelists include: </p>

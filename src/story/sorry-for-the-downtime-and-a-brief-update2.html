<p>For everyone tuning in between 4 and 7, I apologize for the downtime. Turns out that an image handling plugin was overconsuming resources, leading to rendering problems. I&#8217;ve basically re-written most of our site to avoid using the plugin, and I&#8217;ll be looking for an alternative tomorrow.</p>

<p>At any rate, we&#8217;re back.</p>

<p>Also: Some good news. Our &#8220;Add an Event&#8221; page is fixed. It had an incompatibility with the latest version of ExpressionEngine, which I just took care of. Add away.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

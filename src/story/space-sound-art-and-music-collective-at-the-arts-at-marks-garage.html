<p>For their inaugural event, Space &amp; Sound is featuring artist and producer, Teebs from Los Angeles alongside local artists MyCryptonauts, BEAK03, and more. The exhibit will run from August through the beginning of September at The Arts at Marks Garage, with a special First Friday event featuring a screening of Dublab.com&#8217;s mini documentary <i>Secondhand Sureshots</i> and musical performances.</p>

<p>Out of the thriving LA beat scene, Teebs emerges with his own take on music and art. Originally from Chino Hills, Teebs (real name Mtendere Mandowa [pronounced ten-de-ra]) has relocated to LA proper alongside other LA beat producers such as Flying Lotus and Samiyam.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a deeply rooted sound to Teebs&#8217; music that connects with our everyday surroundings. It spotlights emotional corners and builds warmth over the listener. His artwork echoes this same feeling in a visual medium. Rich in color, complex, yet leaving enough breathing room for its subjects to shine. In one project, Teebs collected old record sleeves from his crates, friends, and records shops. Combining paint, markers, stencil work, collage, the original artwork, and even gold foil and rust, Teebs breathed new life into over 50 previously dusty and decomposing sleeves.</p>

<p>Aaron Lee’s Cryptonauts are fun plushie cuddly monsters that have cultural references of Asian and Mexican ritualistic and pop expressionism. Having been born in Mexico and raised in both Texas and Hawaii, Aaron’s work is largely influenced by his childhood experiences.</p>

<p>Space &amp; Sound is an art and music promotion and production collective based in Honolulu, Hawaii. They are dedicated to supporting and exposing new art and music to our local community; aiming to push the limits of visual and aural performance and experience. <br />

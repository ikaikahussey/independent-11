<p>News flash. The people of Hawaii love the canned precooked meat product otherwise known as SPAM.</p>

<p>To honor that love, Hormel Foods, the makers of SPAM, is introducing its new and locally designed SPAM Brand label created by Scott Kaneshiro of Mililani. The new can will be in retail stores throughout Hawaii starting August 1 and will be available for a limited time. </p>

<p>To help celebrate the new design, Hormel Foods is launching another exclusive contest. This time, Hawaii residents will be asked to submit a thirty-second video tribute to <a href="http://www.hawaiispamcan.com" target="_blank">www.hawaiispamcan.com</a> by telling Hormel Foods how much they love SPAM or what SPAM means to them.</p>

<p>“The SPAM Brand Label Design contest was such a success that we wanted to celebrate the winning design by bringing it to Hawaii stores with a fun exclusive Hawaii contest,” said Jen Nolander, Associate Product Manager of the SPAM brand. &#8220;We want participants to have fun with it&#8212;sing a song, choreograph a dance, recite a poem, anything! We know that the people of Hawaii are very creative, so we are excited to see what they will come up with.”</p>

<p>Contestants have until August 12 at 11:59 p.m. to submit their videos to <a href="http://www.hawaiispamcan.com" target="_blank">www.hawaiispamcan.com</a>. The public will be able to vote for their favorite video from August 15 through August 19 and the top five will be selected. </p>

<p>The grand prize includes $500 cash, The Auto Moto (a valid motorcycle license is required when redeeming The Auto Moto), a SPAM gift bag, plus a year supply of SPAM products. The four runner-ups will receive a case of SPAM products and a SPAM Brand gift bag. </p>

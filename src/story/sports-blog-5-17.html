<p>All Hawaii prep sports have finally come to a close for the 2009-2010 school year this past weekend. The New City Nissan State Volleyball tournament crowned Punahou champions this past Saturday sweeping Kamehameha-Kapalama, 25-18, 25-20, 25-20. In the David vs. Goliath type match, there was no exciting story or big upset; Goliath seemed too powerful and too in rhythm to be affected by David&#8217;s (Kamehameha) heart and the scrappy play. </p>

<p>Punahou, 23-0, looked to be playing the team&#8217;s best game of the high school season, with all players executing in their own position. The Warriors, had to deal with a large height difference with three players for the Buffanblu measuring at 6&#8217;4&#8221; or taller. Even though Kamehameha kept it close early in all three sets, Punahou quickly showed the crowd why they are number one in the state and in the nation, according to ESPN Rise. </p>

<p>On the Division II side, Seabury Hall made history being crowned tournament champs, becoming the first Maui high school to win a state volleyball title. The Spartans, ranked fifth in the state, looked weak at first losing an open set to number ten ranked Pahoa from the Big Island. After losing the first set, it was as if they never lost rallying back to win in four sets, 19-25, 25-16, 25-8, 25-19.</p>

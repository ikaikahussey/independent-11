<p>The spring sports season is slowly coming to a close for many athletes, as teams&#8217; hopes for a championship run are shattered while a handful of teams are still working hard to chase that State title. </p>

<p>With so much excitement brewing in Hawaii&#8217;s local sports, it&#8217;s surprising to me that there aren&#8217;t easier ways to catch the action. When was the last time we saw boys&#8217; high school volleyball on OC16? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll wait. Now that the OIA boys&#8217; volleyball season is wrapping up with championship games set for Thursday, many weren&#8217;t even sure that season had started. The widely televised sport in Hawaii is always in the favor of the girls. Many regular season high school games are televised and highly publicized, as the names of seniors become household names of fans. However it&#8217;s boys season now, and the games lined up to be seen on TV  are the championship title games and that&#8217;s it. As last years state tournament was not played in Stan Sheriff because of college graduations, let&#8217;s hope that this year, the boys teams will get the same amount of attention girls do come time for state championships. </p>

<p>The OIA high school softball season finished off in swinging fashion as many in the crowd saw batters pound away hit after hit, putting up big numbers on the scoreboard. The ladies of Mililani High School proved why they were ready to defend their state title as they rolled past Castle Saturday night, achieving their third OIA championship in four years, winning 20-2. The OIA Red (Division I) match up was not so much of a &#8220;match up&#8221; as the game was called early due to mercy rules ending in the fifth inning. The Lady Trojans, who end their OIA season 12-3, accumulated 22 hits that included nine doubles and three home runs as Castle totaled for six hits. Mililani will now be the top-seed of the OIA as they get a automatic first-round bye for the DataHouse DI state tournament which starts May 11 at Raibow Wahine Softball Stadium. </p>

<p>In the White Division (DII) championship match, it was a final inning thriller as the Kalani Falcons, down by one run going into the bottom of the sixth inning, reclaimed the lead scoring three runs to take and keep the lead. Kalani came up big on offense producing 12 hits as the team held off Waialua High School 12-10. In the top of the seventh inning Waialua was able to get a runner on base. However, Rayme Awaya, who relieved starting pitcher Jade Teruya in the second inning, kept the runner at first and earned the win for the Falcons. The Division II state championships will also be held at Rainbow Wahine Softball Stadium.</p>

<p>Keeping with the softball news, the Rainbow Wahine finished off their regular season atop the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). Hawaii went into this weekend&#8217;s Fresno State series undefeated in the WAC, but that was snapped as the 18 win streak was broken. Fresno State won the first game 9-7. However, in a capacity crowd game, UH was able to split the double header winning the second game 5-4. Hawaii finishes off its outstanding regular season 19-1 in the WAC and 41-12 overall. Now on a week break, the Rainbow Wahine will be able to prepare for school exams and rest up before traveling to Las Cruces, New Mexico on May 12 to 15.</p>

<p>Sidenote, Floyd Mayweather Jr. beat &#8220;Sugar&#8221; Shane Mosely in a 12-round lopsided decision welterweight showdown. Mayweather remains undefeated and so does his ego.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Don&#8217;t forget to go for a run, swim, hike, play a pick-up game or just get out of your office, if you have one. Enjoy Hawaii and being healthy!</p>

<p>Stanley Chang <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mediacall/tax-day-media-call">spoke today</a> on the need for millionaires to carry a higher tax burden. </p>

<blockquote><p>We recently introduced our platform: the Agenda for Change, which calls for bold progressive policy solutions such as job creation through government investments in infrastructure, free college education in exchange for service, and universal public pre-kindergarten. None of these programs would be possible without an equitable tax system in which everybody contributes his or her fair share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The call was organized by Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a progressive political action committee.</p>

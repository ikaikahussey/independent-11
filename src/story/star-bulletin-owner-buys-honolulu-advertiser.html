<p>HONOLULU&#8212;News that Canadian publisher David Black, owner of the <i>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</i>, had purchased the <i>Honolulu Advertiser</i> spread throughout Hawaii through Twitter, Facebook, local news briefs, and word of mouth within minutes of a 4:00 p.m. meeting attended simultaneously by the staff of both newspaper operations today on Thursday, February 25.</p>

<p>A statement put out on the <i>Star-Bulletin</i> website said the agreement was announced by Oahu Publications Inc., which owns the <i>Star-Bulletin</i>, <i>MidWeek</i>, and other weekly newspapers and magazines, and Gannett Co., owner of the <i>Advertiser</i>. Oahu Publications also will get related assets in addition to the <i>Advertiser</i>, including its website, non-daily publications, and Gannett&#8217;s interest in Hawaii.com. It does not include the <i>Advertiser</i>&#8216;s office building at 605 Kapiolani Blvd.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are pleased to be able to purchase <i>The Advertiser,</i> a strong and excellent newspaper,&#8221; said Black, chairman of Oahu Publications in a statement. &#8220;We will endeavor to continue the tradition of good Hawaii newspaper stewardship as exemplified in modern times by Twigg Smith and Gannett.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oahu Publications discussed the transaction with the the U.S. Justice Department and Hawaii Attorney General Mark Bennett.</p>

<p>The <i>Advertiser</i> was one of only a few Gannett properties that was losing money. The <i>Advertiser</i> had previously spent $82 million on a state-of-the-art printing press, gave its current staff a two-year 10 percent pay cut, and laid off 164 people since 2007. There are approximately 550 employees on staff.</p>

<p>The <i>Star-Bulletin</i> was founded in 1882 by J. W. Robertson and Company. After public opposition kept former owners Liberty Newspapers from closing the <i>Star-Bulletin</i> in 1999, it ran in joint operation with the <i>Advertiser</i> through 2001 before being picked up by Black.</p>

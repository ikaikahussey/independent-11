<p>HONOLULU&#8212;State Department of Transportation (DOT) Director Brennon Morioka has submitted his resignation to accept a job as executive vice president of Shioi Construction, Inc., in Pearl City. Morioka&#8217;s last day at the DOT will be Thursday, September 23.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Morioka has been with the DOT since 2005, when he served as Highways Division deputy director. In 2007, Gov. Linda Lingle appointed him director to oversee and manage the State’s 15 airports, 10 commercial harbors, and approximately 2,500 lane miles of roadway across Hawaii.</p>

<p>“Serving as the DOT director has been both an honor and a privilege,” said Morioka. “I am proud to have had the opportunity to work alongside some of the most dedicated and talented people in the State, and been a part of a team that believes that we can make a difference in improving the quality of life and safety for the people of Hawaii.”</p>

<p>During Morioka&#8217;s tenure, the Airports Division implemented a $2.3 billion Airports Modernization Plan and the Harbors Division began a $618 million Harbors Modernization Plan. Morioka also spent the past two legislative sessions advocating for a $4 billion Highways Modernization Plan for upgrades  to the State’s roadway system.</p>

<p>Some of the most notable projects during Morioka’s tenure according to the Governor&#8217;s Office include: the completion of Haleakala Highway and Mokulele Highway projects and the groundbreaking of Lahaina Bypass on Maui; the completion of Queen Kaahumanu Highway, Phase 1, and the groundbreaking of Phase 2 on Hawaii Island; the opening of Kualakai Parkway (North-South Road), completion of the Fort Weaver Road widening and Puuloa Road resurfacing projects, the implementation of the PM Contraflow Lane and Middle Street Merge widening projects, the construction of Kapolei Interchange, the launch of the Freeway Service Patrol and GoAkamai Traveler Information Website, and the opening of the new airport parking garage and international arrivals corridor on Oahu; and the groundbreaking of the Kaumualii Highway Resurfacing Project and widening of Wailua Cane Haul Bridge and K?hi? Highway on Kauai.</p>

<p>Mike Formby, deputy director of the DOT Harbors Division, will serve as DOT’s interim director. Formby is a lawyer by training and prior to DOT, was the president and treasurer of Frame Formby and O’Kane, Attorneys at Law, where he was a senior litigation attorney. Formby has taught admiralty law as an adjunct professor at the University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law, was vice chair of the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission, served on the Hawaii Community Development Authority, and is the current chair of the State of Hawaii Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust Fund (EUTF). Prior to his private civil law practice in Hawaii commencing in 1990, Formby was a contracting officer in the U.S. Air Force, negotiating aircraft and software procurements under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>

<p>KAILUA&#8212;Gov. Linda Lingle has released a $1.5 million capital improvement project grant that will go toward the building of a permanent Windward Clubhouse for the Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Under a partnership between the Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii and the Department of Education, the facility will be located on the grounds of Kailua Intermediate School. The state funds will be used to renovate the existing boys locker room in the physical education building into two new locker rooms and showers&#8212;one for boys and one for girls. Other components of the planned Windward Clubhouse include developing a media center, erecting an additional building to house a social recreational facility, and covering a portion of the existing basketball courts.</p>

<p>The Clubhouse will be available to youth from all schools on the Windward side of Oahu during non-school hours, including afterschool, intersession, and holidays. It will offer youth development programs that emphasize character and leadership development; education, technology, and career development; health and life skills; the arts; and sports, fitness, and recreation. During regular school hours, the Windward Clubhouse will be used by Kailua Intermediate’s approximately 650-670 students.</p>

<p>“This is an extremely exciting opportunity to create an educational experience for young people,” said David Nakada, executive director, Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii.&nbsp; “By partnering with the State DOE we are able to build a facility and offer a program that will seamlessly create an 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., in-school and afterschool day at Kailua Intermediate School. We could not have come this far without the visionary leadership and perseverance of Kailua Intermediate School Principal Suzanne Mulcahy,” Nakada added.</p>

<p>The total cost of the project is estimated at $5 million. The Boys and Girls Club has successfully raised the remaining $3.5 million through private donations from corporations, foundations, and individuals.</p>

<p>The Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii operates seven facilities on Oahu and two on Kauai where members can access programs and services that guide them to become responsible citizens. Known as “The Positive Place for Kids,” Boys and Girls Club clubhouses and outreach sites provide guidance-oriented character development programs six days a week for children 7 to 17 years old. Annual membership is $1. </p>

<p>The Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii is a charter member of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and has been operating in Hawaii since 1976. The organization touches the lives of nearly 4,800 members and provides services to an additional 5,000 youths each year, many from disadvantaged circumstances.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;NASA and the State of Hawai&#8217;i have agreed to collaborate on a wide range of activities to promote America&#8217;s human and robotic exploration of space. The partnership also will contribute to the development of education programs and foster economic opportunities including new, high-tech jobs.</p>

<p>Governor Neil Abercrombie and NASA Associate Deputy Administrator Rebecca Keiser signed a two-year agreement, formally called a non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement Annex, during a ceremony today in the Governor’s Office. The ceremony was held on the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy&#8217;s historic 1961 announcement committing the country to land an American on the moon and return him safely before the end of the decade.<br />
 <br />
“Hawai&#8217;i has been part of America’s space activities from the beginning of the space program when Apollo astronauts trained in the islands for their historic missions to the moon,” Governor Abercrombie said. “This partnership with NASA will broaden educational and employment opportunities for our local families and bring dollars into our economy.” </p>

<p>The agreement establishes a partnership between NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., and Hawai&#8217;i to explore and test new technologies, capabilities and strategies supporting America&#8217;s space exploration and development goals. </p>

<p>Under the agreement, the state is proposing to explore the development of a prototype International Lunar Research Park at the University of Hawai&#8217;i on Hilo. It would use the state&#8217;s unique terrain, which is similar to that of the moon and Mars, to enable development and testing of advanced automated and tele-robotic vehicles. Researchers would benefit from Hawai&#8217;i’s natural geography, advanced communications, power generation and other technologies required for space exploration. </p>

<p>“This is the type of participatory exploration involving universities and small- to mid-sized high technology companies that is becoming an increasingly important component of the 21st century space program,” Keiser said. </p>

<p>The state will provide the prototype test environment and infrastructure for the proposed analog test facilities. NASA will evaluate new concepts and models for conducting space exploration. The state will explore the potential to develop and mature innovative space-related technologies for educational, industry and government use.</p>

<p>“Locally, this collaboration should catalyze Hawai&#8217;i-based economic innovation and engage engineers, scientists, educators, and students, as well as commercial entrepreneurs, to increase the opportunities and benefits of space exploration,” said Jim Crisafulli, director of Hawai&#8217;i’s Office of Aerospace Development.</p>

<p><b>Why are you running for office?</b><br />
I have burning passion to offer the residents in my district a voice of reason and hope. I believe we can change and start fresh with new innovative ways to solve Hawaii’s problems. But it starts with new leadership and a vision that looks to care for all people, not just special interest unions who suck the dues from Hawaii families with no regard to the taxpayers needs. </p>

<p><b>What is the single most important issue for your constituents?</b><br />
Hawaii needs a political revolution. Every major issue &#8212;the economy, education, health care, and &#8220;homelessness&#8221;&#8212; can all be addressed with this one change. The “Old boy” establishment has totally lost touch with protecting the families in their communities. Bar none, the greatest problem is the lack of balance and accountability in Hawaii politics today.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
I will offer the voters in my district their only chance for change in a 12-year span since I am the only person to have run against him in 3 elections. Brian Taniguchi’s recent political mailer mentions only two points. He is open and accessible and experienced. I hope he is accessible, that’s the bare minimum requirement to serve the people. Does this prove that other politicians are hiding from their constituents? He mentions that he has an “understanding of how to make the legislative process work for us.” It certainly communicates that he manipulates the system the best, especially for himself and his supporters. When he says “us,” I know it doesn’t mean me since he has voted opposite of everything I would have voted on. I would bring new energy and passion to go well beyond &#8220;open and experienced.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
Two of my old friends from the church I attended as a teen have been in a tie with the contribution that my mother has made.</p>

<p><b>Who do you plan on including in your staff?</b><br />
I will be objective and will take in resumes from anyone in the community who feels that they want to work to help improve the state. I do have some friends that I will consider. They need to apply like everyone else.</p>

<p><b>What’s your strategy in dealing with the &#8220;homeless&#8221;? (I covered last month&#8217;s town meeting at Washington Middle School, so I know this is a major issue for your district.)</b><br />
Here is just one innovative idea. I would propose to create culture-based community ohana groups by connecting people in need and strengthening the values of Polynesian cultures through various activities such as farming native food crops and the production of locally made products on unused State and government lands. Living standards would at first be limited to the standards of old Hawaii, but is better than not having a roof over their heads as it is now.</p>

<p>We need to establish a holistic approach of networking businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies to uplift the needy to encourage them to work together in self-sustaining communities.</p>

<p>They have already created these communities where they help each other watch over their things and provide protection. Those who are more capable often help those less mentally sound. These communities would begin with government assistance to initially draw the needy and organize themselves, but nonprofits would assist to provide and help maintain order and logistics. Other organizations can help the needy create businesses based off their culture-based products and services. I envision them to be cultural learning centers for youth to learn hula and cultural history of Hawaii and even grow to the likes of the Polynesian Cultural Center, where tourists would want to stop to see aloha in action. What a testimony to the world that would be.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>What’s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
No rail period. All Japan&#8217;s rails have had to privatize since government could not manage and afford it. If it were so great, then private industry and demand would have created it a long time ago. Rail, if it continues, will bankrupt the City and clearly it is the government stealing from the poor to give to the rich. Those who seek to benefit from this $5.5 billion are not your everyday Hawaii citizens. It’s the largest Ponzi Scheme in Hawaii history where we are all forced to put our hard earned money in a pot from which only those in the top will take the money now with no regard for future. Most Oahu residents logistically will never ride it or ever see any benefit from it. </p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for House Bill 444?</b><br />
I definitely would have voted &#8220;no.&#8221; The legislators did a great injustice to both the supporters and opponents in secretly convening and conniving to suspend the rules on the last day of the session in order to pass a very controversial law that has little support from the majority of Hawaii. The overwhelming majority of voters believe marriage should be between a man and a woman, of which I am one of them. </p>

<p><b>Do you support the Akaka Bill?</b><br />
I support the fact that Native Hawaiians should be able to have their rights similar to other native and indigenous peoples. I would need to read it before giving it my full support. I would be weary as many were about its scope and possible conflicts with State laws and jurisdictions. I believe that it should not impede on the rights of the people of Hawaii as a whole. I also feel that race-base legislation draws a fine line between racism and fairness.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
Simplify the election process. Maybe even create tax incentives for those who vote. They could possibly get priority on their tax returns and extensions on their tax payments. Reevaluate the neighborhood boards&#8217; structure, authority, and purpose. Make it exciting and in touch with community organizations to allow inspiration and innovation to invigorate the electorate in each community to get involved in the process.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii’s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Simplify the tax codes and decrease the tax burden on businesses as well as its residents. Make Hawaii business friendly by removing countless restrictions and limitations that the political establishments have placed on the businesses of Hawaii.</p>

<p><b>How do we solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem?</b><br />
Equip the unemployed to start their own businesses. Require those on unemployment to take classes on running and creating their own businesses. Utilize some of those unemployment benefits as business floats. Create government-sponsored monthly apprenticeship programs where businesses can have those on the unemployment rolls learn on-the-job training by volunteering at a business while being paid unemployment. This benefits both the business and the worker. If the company likes them, they could be hired. If not, the worker has attained more experience and builds on their resume.</p>

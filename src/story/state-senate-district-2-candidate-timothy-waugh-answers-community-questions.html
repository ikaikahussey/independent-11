<p><b>Why are you running for office?</b><br />
I absolutely cannot do worse than any person already in office, and I have fresh ideas worth implementing.</p>

<p><b>What is the single most important issue for your constituents?</b><br />
The lack of revenue for public safety in the East Hawaii district&#8217;s rural areas.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
Communication is terrible at best between all sectors of government in getting not only important, but necessary services to the people in these areas.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor?</b><br />
I have not solicited any Campaign Donations.</p>

<p><b>Who do you plan on including in your staff?</b><br />
People who care, from every age and racial background possible.</p>

<p><b>What’s your strategy in dealing with the &#8220;homeless&#8221;?</b><br />
State housing assistance, with a cap on length of time. The trade off for housing would be education in trades, or volunteer time in a State or County program as payment for rent, or apprenticeship programs within the Private Sector.</p>

<p><b>What’s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
I support rail not only in Honolulu, but the &#8220;Big Island&#8221; of Hawaii for gold coast employees and tourism.</p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for HB 444?</b><br />
My personal opinions do not count in this nor any other issue. The voters should decide, and if that is not possible, my vote should reflect the majority of my constituent’s concerns.</p>

<p><b>Do you support the Akaka Bill?</b><br />
Yes. Native people should have the right to self governance and revenue production to further the education and opportunities of its people.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
Allow all citizens the right to vote, and not making jury duty mandatory for registered voters.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii’s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
Repeal the State personal income tax. Increase the GE tax, and cut employment taxes until a better economy surfaces.</p>

<p><b>How do we solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem?</b><br />
Apprenticeship programs in the private sector and free community college tuition.</p>

<p><b>How do you feel about medical marijuana on Hawaii Island?</b><br />
If a licensed medical doctor prescribes any narcotic, it’s allowed. A doctor should have the right to prescribe the best course of remedy for his/her patients without fear of prosecution for himself or the patient.</p>

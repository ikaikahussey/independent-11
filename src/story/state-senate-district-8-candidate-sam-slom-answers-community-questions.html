<p><b>Why are you running for office?</b><br />
I believe in a two-party system and I work hard to help make Hawaii affordable again, to oppose even higher taxes and harmful legislation and to provide individuals and small businesses better economic choices while improving our economic and investment climate. I also want meaningful changes to our public education system. I have experience, energy, a proven record and transparent votes on the issues that are easily accessible.</p>

<p><b>What is the single most important issue for your constituents?</b><br />
Job creation and a healthy economy. Without economic choices, political and other choices are jeopardized.</p>

<p><b>What would you change in the way that issue is being handled presently?</b><br />
The majority party believes that more taxes and more prohibitions on known job creators is the answer along with additional spending, debt, and federal bailouts/&#8220;stimulus.&#8221; I understand that no state, and no country, ever taxed their citizens into prosperity. I would reduce or eliminate taxes, oppose new taxes and provide incentives for those who work and create opportunities for others. Spending must be reduced along with debt. Government must be held accountable.</p>

<p><b>Who is your largest campaign contributor</b><br />
I don&#8217;t know; I just recently began accepting donations. My campaign spending reports will detail a broad diversity of individuals and groups but probably no unions. I do not accept donations in the years I am not running.</p>

<p><b>Who do you plan on including in your staff?</b><br />
Campaign staff? Emphasis on young, bright, energetic volunteers who will have a major role in shaping the campaign and who have ideas and workable alternatives to the status quo.</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your strategy in dealing with the homeless?</b><br />
Stop the bickering between State and County and treat causes vs. symptoms of &#8220;homelessness,&#8221; e.g., higher cost of living brought on by legislative programs and taxes. No one panacea. Priority given to homeless families with children who work. Demand Federal Government pay more for the unfunded mandate bringing thousands of Micronesians to Hawaii on welfare or &#8220;homelessness.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>What&#8217;s your stance on rail? Can Hawaii afford it?</b><br />
I am opposed to the $6 billion-plus heavy, elevated rail as proposed; a &#8220;train to nowhere.&#8221; We can&#8217;t afford it with the other must do projects: sewer repairs, wastewater treatment, water mains, roads, and infrastructure, which total more than $25 billion. It is a project for unions, developers, and special interests and will not reduce congestion or give us the ability to build, operate, and maintain without more oppressive taxation.</p>

<p><b>Where do you stand on civil unions? Would you have voted for HB 444?</b><br />
My overall position, often stated, is the government should not be involved in marriage. Period. I voted against HB 444, after the 18-hour Senate hearing&#8212;the longest Hawaii legislative hearing ever held&#8212;while supporting domestic partnerships which were designed to solve individual problems. I would support certain aspects of reforms designed to give additional legal rights to partners not covered now (power of attorney, medical decisions, etc.) but oppose same sex marriage. The issue is more about money and taxpayer benefits than &#8220;equality&#8221; or love. The way the House passed the bill in the final moments of the 2010 Session was disgraceful for all concerned.</p>

<p><b>Do you support the Akaka Bill?</b><br />
I oppose the Akaka Bill but support existing Native Hawaiian Rights (Hawaiian Homelands, KSBE, etc.). Changes to the bill have been made in secret, behind closed doors and in D.C., not Hawaii. I am the only Hawaii legislator to have voted against a pro-Akaka resolution. We need an open forum and referendum on Akaka here in Hawaii. I do not believe in a racial, separate government within a government, giving special rights to one group over other taxpayers. Many Native Hawaiians oppose Akaka and I have respected them.</p>

<p><b>How do we get Hawaii residents active in the elections process?</b><br />
It is difficult but worth the effort. Hawaii once led the Nation in turnout; now we are last at number 50. The mainstream media fail because they like personality clashes, not the clash of ideas, and want entertainment not education. There should be more open and live coverage of political issues but I doubt that will occur. Barring that, we need good candidates and competitive races in all districts and for all offices.</p>

<p><b>How can we help Hawaii&#8217;s small businesses to stay alive during these hard times?</b><br />
By cutting taxes, reducing harmful employer mandates, and listening to small businesses who always tell the Legislature what they need. Hawaii is anti-business and is always ranked among the lowest states in business climate. Solutions are easy and inexpensive. Too many lawmakers have no business experience and never have met a private payroll.</p>

<p><b>How do we solve Hawaii&#8217;s unemployment problem?</b><br />
By creating jobs, assisting existing job creators and providing more take home pay as a result of less taxation.</p>

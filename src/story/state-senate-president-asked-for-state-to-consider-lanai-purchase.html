Abercrombie:  <blockquote> \"The uncertainty that the potential sale represents presents grave concerns of the future of the people of Lanai,\" said Senator Tsutsui in a news release Wednesday. \"The continued private ownership of Lanai may prove detrimental to the people of Lanai and the state, as a private owner is not subject to public, community, or government input in making decisions that can and will affect such parties.\" </blockquote>",

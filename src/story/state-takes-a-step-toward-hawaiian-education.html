<p>Two images of Native Hawaiians permeated the media yesterday: the first, of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/18/maui-racism-video_n_4809326.html">an angry Maui man</a>. The second, of Hawaiian educators at the Board of Education.</p>

<p>Their juxtaposition is coincidental, but useful. The solution to the former begins with the latter, and further efforts to empower Native Hawaiians.</p>

<div class="pull-gold">The solution is power and empowerment, and education is a big part of that.</div>

<p>Over the past decade, the Hawaiian educational movement has led to a centripetal pulling-away from the mainstream, effectively creating a separate, and often unequal charter and immersion system.</p>

<p>The efforts that <a href="http://www.hawaiiboe.net/About/Members/Pages/CherylKauhaneLupenui.aspx">Cheryl Lupenui</a> has moved through the DOE, however, are pulling back in the right direction: the reform of the mainstream system. Hawaiian-language assessments, a Hawaiian education leader in the Superintendent’s office, and a framework for native values all help to achieve a more equal society in which Hawaiian language, culture, and people are no longer on the margins.</p>

<p>Anger from a displaced people – that’s the subtext in the now-viral Maui video, and it’s a phenomenon that most Native Hawaiians – including this one – can identify with. The solution is power and empowerment, and education is a big part of that. So too is housing, humane employment, and self-determination.</p>

<p>Pila Wilson is right: it’s not enough, we can and should go farther. It shouldn’t be odd or notable to speak Hawaiian. (Parenthetically, a news report on Hawaii Public Radio last week noted that a legislator “spoke Hawaiian without translating.” That ought to not be news.) But this is forward movement.</p>

<p>According to news sources Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming have posted petitions to secede from the U.S. on the White House Petition site.</p>

<p>Hawaii&#8217;s name is listed among them. I beg to differ. Hawaii is not able to secede from the union of U.S. states for the simple reason that it does not need to.<br />
Hawaii is not legally part of the U.S. as there is not a legal instrument of annexation to the U.S., nor historically signifying it to be a U.S. territory and then state were and are bogus designations.</p>

<p>Hawaii, although its title has become clouded by U.S. manipulation,&nbsp; remains an independent and sovereign country. </p>

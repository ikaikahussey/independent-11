<p>HONOLULU &#8212; <a href="http://www.p20hawaii.org/" target="_blank">Hawai‘i P-20 Partnerships for Education</a>, the <a href="http://www.hawaiiboe.net/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank">Hawai‘i State Board of Education</a> (BOE) and the <a href="http://doe.k12.hi.us/" target="_blank">Department of Education</a> are coordinating a statewide drive to encourage public school eighth and ninth graders to “step up”, by opting in to earn the Hawaii State Board of Education’s (BOE) “Step Up” Recognition Diploma. The program includes more challenging classes in math, science and writing, and it also includes the completion of a senior project.&nbsp; The diploma is available to all Hawaii public school students beginning with the class of 2013 (current sophomores). </p>

<p>“The Step Up Campaign encourages rigorous academic achievement and is part of Hawai‘i’s education reform plan to ensure every public school student graduates career and college ready,” said DOE Superintendent Kathyrn Matayoshi. “The BOE Recognition Diploma is an investment by our graduates to ensure they have more choices upon graduation.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>“Ensuring students are career and college ready is at the top of our state’s education agenda. To succeed in today’s information age and to prepare for a dynamic and ever-changing future, students need to have a high- quality education that includes studying advanced reading, writing and mathematics,” said Karen Lee, Executive Director, Hawai‘i P-20. </p>

<p>First initiated in 2009, currently more than 9,800 public school students statewide from the classes of 2013, 2014 and 2015 have committed to earning the BOE “Step Up” Recognition Diploma, including 4,286 sophomores, 3,813 freshmen and 1,744 eighth graders. On Oahu alone, more than 7,200 students have enrolled in the program. </p>

<p>In addition, the following Oahu schools have pledged more than 50 percent of its students from the classes of 2014 or 2015: Anuenue, Hawaii Technology Academy, Mililani High, Roosevelt High, Central Middle, and Stevenson Middle. The program hopes to enroll as many as possible eighth and ninth graders by May 31, 2011.</p>

<p>Features of the program include:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; While in high school, Step Up students will receive information on college and career preparation and invitations to college-prep events and other activities.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Graduates who earn the BOE “Step Up” Recognition Diploma have better access to college grants and scholarships, as well as special consideration for various Hawai‘i scholarships.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Students who earn a GPA of 3.0 or higher receive the BOE “Step Up” Recognition Diploma with Honors, and will receive priority admission to select Hawai‘i colleges and universities (other conditions may apply).</p>

<p>•&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Select Hawai‘i employers will grant advancement in their employment application processes including the Carpenters and Drywall Union apprenticeship programs, City Mill, Hawaiian Electric Company, Maui Electric Company, Hawai‘i Electric Light Company, and Island Movers.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Step Up campaign aligns with a national movement to raise the value of a high school diploma by increasing the rigor of high school standards, assessments and curriculum, and aligning expectations with the demands of post-secondary education and careers. To date, 20 states and Washington D.C. have adopted a more challenging diploma aligned with national standards.</p>

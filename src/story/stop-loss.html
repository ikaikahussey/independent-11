<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Congresswoman Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) is reminding eligible service members to apply for Retroactive Stop Loss Special Pay before the upcoming December 3 deadline. Members of the military who had to continue to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq due to Stop Loss orders between September 11, 2001 and September 30, 2009 are eligible to receive an additional $500 for every month or partial month of additional service. </p>

<p>Stop Loss is the term used when an active duty member of the military involuntarily has their enlistment extended or retirement suspended.</p>

<p>“This is money our military personnel has earned,” Hirono said. “Despite ongoing efforts to spread the word, an estimated 80,000 eligible service members, veterans, and beneficiaries have yet to submit paperwork. We need to let them know before time runs out.”</p>

<p>Congress set aside $534 million for these Stop Loss Payments in October of 2009. But, according to the U.S. Department of Defense, less than half of that funding&#8212;$219 million&#8212;has been paid out.</p>

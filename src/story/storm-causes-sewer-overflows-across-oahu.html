<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On Sunday, the City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services responded to multiple sanitary sewer overflows across Oahu, caused mostly by heavy rains.</p>

<p>Pipe failure is believed to have caused a manhole at the rear of 2010 9th Ave. to release wastewater into Palolo Stream. A manhole at 1521 8th Ave. also discharged into the stream.</p>

<p>Sanitary sewer overflows caused by wet weather were also reported at 1015 North School St. and the intersection of Pine and Sumner streets&#8212;storm drains in these areas lead to Honolulu Harbor.</p>

<p>The Kaneohe Pretreatment Facility and Kailua Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant experienced wet weather surges discharging wastewater into Kaneohe Bay and Nuupia Pond. Manholes in the Windward area at the intersection of Kihapai Place and Kihapai Street, Lihiwai Street and Popoia Street also discharged wastewater.</p>

<p>In Nuuanu, overflows were reported at 2240 Pacific Heights Dr., 3255 Pali Hwy., and at the intersection of Kakahiaka and Waanao streets.</p>

<p>Volumes for each overflow are not available at this time.</p>

<p>Crews cleaned, disinfected, and deodorized the affected areas, the City said. Signing has been completed at multiple locations.</p>

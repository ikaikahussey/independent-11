<p>About 30 concerned citizens, led by student group HauMANA, took to the corner of Likelike and Kamehameha Highway Saturday morning to campaign against the military expansion in Kaneohe. The protests were aimed at the <a href="http://www.kaneohebayairshow.com">Kaneohe Bay Air Show</a>, labeled a “show of force” by the group, and the soon to be arriving Osprey aircraft at the Marine Base.</p>

<p>The group waved at cars, held  signs, waved flags, and chanted. The response from passersby was mainly positive. </p>

<p>“We had lots of community support, way more than we anticipated,” said Ilima Long, who was handling media contact for HauMANA. “We wanted to show solidarity with those in the community that don’t feel that it&#8217;s right, or that the things that are going on today are problematic.” </p>

<p>The group plans to continue to educate the community about the Osprey aircraft and the negative impacts that they will create in Kaneohe. </p>

<p>The campaigners also voiced solidarity with the demonstrations in Okinawa, where <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120910a2.html">30,000 civilians are blocking access to an airfield</a> that will also base Ospreys for the United States.</p>

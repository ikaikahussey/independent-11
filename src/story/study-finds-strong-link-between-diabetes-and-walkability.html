<blockquote>
<p>In the most startling finding, the <a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/early/2012/08/24/dc12-0777.abstract">study</a> found that a new immigrant in a less walkable neighborhood was more than 50 percent more likely to develop diabetes than a long-term resident of Toronto living in one of the most walkable areas, regardless of neighborhood income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article notes that the finding is useful for areas in the globe that haven&#8217;t yet adapted to the modern, car-centric urban model. Here&#8217;s to hoping that Honolulu can glean a lesson from this study, too.</p>

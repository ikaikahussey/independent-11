<p>For those tuning in around mid-day today, you would have encountered a very different HI site; no styling, no background, etc. (Think World Wide Web circa 1995.) That was my fault! I blame it on a bug in our cascading style sheet, which I should not have been editing on the live site. Sorry folks, it&#8217;s fixed now.</p>

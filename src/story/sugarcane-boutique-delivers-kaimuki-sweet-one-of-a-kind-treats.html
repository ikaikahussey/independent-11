<p>KAIMUKI&#8212;Having lived in Kaimuki for nearly five years, I have come to love it for many reasons: the wonderful and innovative restaurants, the charming historic homes, the cool families that gather in its many parks, the neighborly vibe, and its central location within East Oahu. Until now, shopping has never been on that list, but with the arrival of Sugarcane Boutique that has officially changed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sugarcane is a locally-owned consignment store that also carries carefully selected new merchandise, mostly by local designers. It sells everything from clothing to glassware, jewelry to furniture,&nbsp; and hats to handbags. Its motto is “ReCycle, ReUse, ReStyle,” and the store’s aesthetic reflects that ethic.</p>

<p>I wandered in on a Thursday around 11:30 a.m., expecting the store to be quiet. Instead, I encountered a steady stream of customers throughout the hour I was there&#8212;some browsing for the first time, others delivering merchandise for consignment, and still more doing their weekly “check in” on new items. </p>

<p>The boutique, though less than a year old, already has a strong devotee of followers. Holding down the fort was the gregarious Lauren Gerstle, who is knowledgeable about what she sells and clearly has strong relationships with her clients. Something refreshing about the store is how both their products and clientele close the generation gap, in keeping with the neighborhood’s feel. There were college kids alongside 60-somethings perusing the wide array of costume jewelry on offer, ranging from $7 starfish earrings by local designer “Lovesome” to ornate vintage brooches. </p>

<p>A man wandered in while waiting for his takeout food and appeared completely “at home” in the decidedly feminine store (apparently a lot of men shop there for gifts). While the shop is crammed with a myriad of fragile items, there is also a wide selection of children’s items by local designers such as Ponopants (cozy diaper covers made from upcycled sweaters) and Wimini (organic tee shirts). Like the store itself, some of the keiki items are new but with a home-spun feel; others are gently used. </p>

<p>Owner Faith Scheiblich is a mother of four and used to own a children’s and maternity shop in Sonoma, California. She said she knew she was going to open up another store upon arrival in Hawaii but did not know what type of boutique it would be. Scheiblich, who now lives in Nui Valley, quickly recognized the dearth of funky vintage and consignment stores in East Honolulu. </p>

<p>Having grown up going to garage sales and thrift stores, she possesses a lifelong passion and appreciation for vintage clothing and decorative arts.&nbsp; Opening her own shop was thus a natural extension of her interests. The result was Sugarcane, which opened in August of 2009. According to Scheiblich, she is “lucky that [the concept] clicked” and “loves seeing people’s faces light up” when discovering a treasure or bargain. It makes her happy to know that many of these items are having a second life, especially on an island such as ours where landfill space is increasingly scarce.</p>

<p>Like many whimsical boutiques of its kind, part of the appeal is the visual effect created by the display of the eclectic items on offer. It hints at a lifestyle, that of someone (most likely a woman) who has cosmopolitan tastes yet is down-to-earth, someone chic yet down-home, town and country. The look is part Anthropologie (a popular mainland chain) and part high-end flea market, both of which are otherwise lacking on Island.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Before moving to Honolulu I lived in New York City, where one-of-a-kind boutiques are a dime-a-dozen. In my old neighborhood, you couldn’t walk two blocks without being lured in by a tempting window display. Sugarcane has the look and feel of a hip store in Brooklyn, NYC’s Lower East Side or San Francisco while being true to its Hawaii locale with a strong nod to a breezy, beach cottage vibe. It fills a necessary void, as evidenced by the buzz it has created around the neighborhood. And its windows are also quite alluring, and currently displaying “Fun &amp; Fabulous Fungi” (must see to believe).</p>

<p>Sugarcane is also one of those stores that inspires impulse buys, a dangerous thing in these times of diminished disposable income. Any consumer guilt is quickly tempered, however, by the knowledge that you are most likely buying something locally made, upcycled, or both.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Whether scoring a pair of gently-worn True Religion jeans for a fraction of their cost new, an Ecolicious bag (perfect for the farmers’ market), “Get Stoned” stoneware, or a vaguely Islamic pair of metal and tile chairs, you are bound to obtain something of quality and lasting value. Another nice thing about Sugarcane is the wide selection of unique gifts under $20, making it a perfect stop for gift needs of all kinds.</p>

<p><i>Sugarcane is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and located at 1137 11th Avenue, #101 (across the way from Hog Island BBQ and downstairs from Himalayan Kitchen.) They can be reached at (808) 739-2263 or sugarcaneshop@gmail.com.</i></p>

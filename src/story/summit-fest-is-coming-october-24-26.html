<p>We&#8217;d like to let you know about the limited release of early release tickets for the launch of the first <a href="http://www.summitfest2014.com/">SUMMIT Fest</a> event, a production of our sister publication <a href="http://summitzine.com">Summit Magazine</a>.

<p>SUMMIT Fest is an interactive event held over three days in Kaka‘ako (the evening of Friday, October 24, Saturday, October 25, and Sunday, October 26) which will highlight Hawai‘i as an innovation hub for the entire Asia-Pacific region. There will be fashion, music, culinary arts, theatre, talks, and discussions about the serious issues of our times - you won&#8217;t want to miss it.</p>

<p>Friday night will entail a kick-off party including cocktails and a post-modern luau, entertainment, music, and a local version of a hosted late-night show replete with musical and celebrity guests.</p>

<p>Saturday and Sunday are organized around keynote sessions that include presenters, performers, and panel discussions. Interwoven with the keynote sessions are breakout sessions that feature interactive, hands-on workshops on a variety of topics. Delicious meals, developed by some of our most innovative chefs will be served throughout the festival.</p>

<p>The festival will offer ample opportunity for learning, exchanging ideas, networking, and enjoyment, and is centered in the developing area of Kaka‘ako with Connected Events happening at Partner Venues citywide. Stay tuned to <a href="http://www.summitfest2014.com/">SummitFest2014.com</a> for more information and upcoming announcements of featured guests and speakers.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Doris Duke Theatre’s Surf Film Festival is back for the third year, this time with 13 films, 11 of them never before screened in Hawaii. The lineup even includes the world premiere of <i>The Oxbow Watermen Experience, </i>about last year’s epic day at Peahi off Maui.</p>

<p>For the first time, the festival features a pass&#8212;$55 for entry to 11 festival screenings. Attendees who buy a pass are automatically entered in a drawing to win a 6-foot Wade Tokoro surfboard.</p>

<p>“This year’s Surf Film Festival is our best ever,” says Academy Film Curator Gina Caruso, who selected the films with the help of Eric and Jackie Walden of the Honolulu surf shop Chinatown Boardroom. “The films range from pure action-packed surfing to a look at surfers who devote their lives to making art. The appeal of films such as <i>Out of Place</i> and <i>Gum for My Boat</i> goes beyond hardcore surfers&#8212;the quality and issues addressed will impress movie fans in general.&#8221;</p>

<p><br />
<b>Opening night reception: July 9, 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.</b><br />
The festival opens with a reception in the Honolulu Academy of Art’s Pavilion Courtyard, featuring free beer and music by Dr. Zaius. Da Spot will serve their global cuisine (Egyptian chicken to Thai curries) for $7 to $8 per plate. Filmmaker Nathan Apffel will be in attendance and take the podium in Doris Duke Theatre at 7:30 p.m. to introduce his film <i>Lost Prophets.</i></p>

See how professional surfers Brian Conley, Reef McIntosh, Hans Hagen, Dave Rastovich, Chris Del Moro, Dede Suryana, Nole Cossart, and Andrew Bennet balance their lives with adventure, dedication, and a deep connection to nature and the sea. Travel with them as they surf on spectacular oceans and experience nature in the most stunning locations in the world. Some people “live life asleep and only dream they’re awake,” says filmmaker Nathan Apffel. “These surfers have found a way to wake up.”</p>

Who knew? Cleveland, Ohio, has had a surfing community since the early 1960s. Director Scott Ditzenberger’s debut film explores this underground scene. We see Vince Labbe and his friends endure harsh winter weather to surf the elusive waves of Lake Erie in a place still recovering from lost jobs and a river polluted enough to catch fire. In a 2006 article on Ditzenberger’s work in progress, the New York Times reported, “They surf in Cleveland because they must. They surf with two-inch icicles clinging to their wet suits. Through stinging hail and overpowering wind. They work nights to spend their winter days scouting surf. They are watermen on an inland sea.” Out of Place took the Viewer’s Choice award at the New York Surf Film Festival this year.</p>

Steve Cleveland packs two years of travel footage in this fast-paced, tightly edited, action-packed surf film. Some of the best longboarders in the world—Alex Knost, CJ Nelson, Hawaii’s own Bonga Perkins—ride all types of surfboards, such as traditional single fin logs, tri-fin hi-performance longboards, alternative and retro shortboards (hulls, eggs, fish, quads, twin fins), alaias and state-of-the art shortboards.</p>

Wyatt Seaverns (known in some circles as Captain Fins) and Mitch Abshere put together this playful mix featuring some of the same surfers that are in Fresh Fruit for Rotten Vegetables short boarding and long boarding on East and West Coast beaches.</p>

The latest from Chris Malloy (A Brokedown Melody) chronicles Jeff Johnson’s surf-and-climbing trip inspired by Yvon Chouinard (founder of Patagonia, the company) and Doug Tompkins’ (founder of The North Face) epic 1968 Ventura-to-Patagonia (the region) adventure, which was documented in the killer film Mountain of the Storms. The two iconic eco-heroes appear in the Patagonia wildlife preserve that Tompkins founded in 1991, so it’s no surprise that the journey and the film end up being as much about conservation as riding waves and climbing peaks.</p>

The son of wildlife photographers, New Zealand director Clive Neeson’s life was one big adventure. The film starts with his parents’ footage of his action-packed 1960s childhood then graduates to Neeson’s own footage—from vintage shots of surf spots Noosa Beach, Petacalco, Spain, Portugal and Bali to proto-wakeboarding and snowboarding. Over time, Neeson saw that his 45 years of records of good times, faraway places and adrenaline-pumping feats could tell a larger story. Neeson reveals how the journeys of a generation of adventurers shaped their lives, values and vocations, and how they paradoxically laid a foundation for eco-tourism. These early sports pioneers’ exploits were rarely captured on quality film footage and most of it was kept under wraps to avoid exposing the secret and fragile refuges—until now.</p>

You’re invited to the Bangladesh Surf Club, which introduces a highly unconventional surfing method to more than 30 boys and girls, many of whom are poverty-stricken street kids. Due to a fearful, conservative culture, the ocean was once deemed off limits to these children, who now see surfing as a source of fun, escape, and even a way to make a living. The film follows professional surfer Kahana Kalama (a past guest star of Fuel TV’s series On Surfari) as he works with Hawaii-based nonprofit Surfing The Nations and learns that sometimes surfing involves more than catching waves.</p>

Every winter swarms of photographers come to Hawaii to focus their cameras on the best surfers in the world. The filmmakers shine light on the North Shore and the overcrowded image-gathering free-for-all winter surfing scene. The surfing industry relies on these awe-inspiring photos to sell surfing to the masses. But before those images can capture the attention of consumers, they first must be captured on camera. Professional surfers, photographers, and cinematographers share their perspective on what it takes and what it means to get that epic shot. This film has won awards at top national surf film festivals and was a hit at HIFF.</p>

This upbeat, joyful film focuses on five contemporary artists who also ride longboards: Andy Davis, Tyler Warren, Julie Goldsetein, Alex Knost, and Wolfgang Bloch. The artists distinguish themselves as artists who surf, but their artwork is inextricably linked to what inspires them—the power of the ocean and the energy and exhilaration of surfing.</p>

Featuring such internationally renowned surfers as world champion Kelly Slater, Kevin Naughton, and the Malloy brothers, Waveriders explores surfing’s legendary Irish roots. This remarkable, awe-inspiring film begins with the heroic tale of visionary Hawaiian-Irish waterman George Freeth, and travels from Hawaii to Southern California to the striking cliffs of Ireland. With must-see footage, this film reaches a thrilling climax when today’s most daring surfers, wearing extra heavy wetsuits, booties, gloves, and headgear conquer the biggest swell—waves reaching more then 50 feet in height—ever ridden in Ireland. Surfer Magazine writes that Waveriders is “a gripping and artful story.”</p>

A mesmerizing surf masterpiece in three parts: chapter 1, chapter 2, and the beginning of the dawn. Director George Greenough chronicles ground zero evolution of the 1968 short board revolution.

Some of the largest waves ever ridden arrived in the El Nino winter of 2009. On December 8, Laird Hamilton and top watermen Kai Lenny, Livi Siver, Duane Desoto, and Jason Polakow, converged on Peahi (also known as Jaws) off Maui’s North Shore to ride one of the biggest swells of the decade (66 feet). Filmed in five countries, The Watermen Experience travels to the Micronesia’s Pohnpei, the hollow barrels of Teahupoo, Tahiti, and to the ocean floor for Jason Polakow’s three-wave hold down at Peahi. The five watermen demonstrate how a lifetime playing in the ocean prepares you for that one awesome—sometimes death-defying—moment. <br />
Reception: Sponsored by Oxbow from 6 p.m. until 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $10 for museum members; $12 for general public. Seats are limited. Please purchase your tickets in advance at our website http://honoluluacademy.tix.com or at the Doris Duke Theatre.</p>

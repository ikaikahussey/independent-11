<p>While denting my couch on a recent, lazy Sunday at home, I found myself mindlessly gawking at the television, switching channels between a PGA golf tournament and reruns of old Vans Triple Crown of Surfing footage from the North Shore. It occurred to me that my interest and enthusiasm for each sport might be considered incongruous by those unaware of the particular and esoteric nature of each pursuit. The two sports might seem worlds apart to someone from, say, Wisconsin, but having grown up in Hawaii, where countless surf spots reel off just offshore from immaculately manicured golf courses, both have been a part of my life&#8217;s visual backdrop since before I can remember.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve long held that surfing and golf are a lot alike in that both have the unique effect of getting people hooked from the moment they experience success in the pursuit. That one wave or that one great golf shot&#8212;each are irresistibly intoxicating and addicting and they usually keep those who experience the feeling in pursuit of it for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>For nonbelievers, the two sports couldn&#8217;t be more different. Golf is terrestrial, with the point being to stay out of the water. With surfing, of course, the very nature of the activity is the opposite. Golf is precise, often a game of inches between triumph and disaster. It is quiet and exacting to the point of inevitable frustration, even for the best in the world. Surfing is a sport about wide strokes and personal expression on a playing field that exists only once. There may be only one trajectory to sink a tricky putt, but there are as many ways of riding a wave as there are people to ride one.</p>

<p>I remember the day that got me hooked on surfing. I practically grew up on a Boogie Board at Bellows Beach (long before the term had to be re-coined as &#8220;body board&#8221; because Boogie Board was copy-righted), but the first wave I remember was at Makapuu Beach when I was about 10. An uncle had decided I was ready for some &#8220;real waves.&#8221; I took off on a wave bigger than any I had ridden before and in that exquisite moment of pure connection with the ocean&#8217;s energy I thought to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;m really doing this! I&#8217;m ripping!&#8221; I carried that feeling of pride and accomplishment for weeks. Bigger and better waves would follow as I grew older, and I would eventually trade up for a surfboard, but The One That Got Me Hooked remains most vivid in my memory to this day.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no longer puzzled by the fact that I remember the Golf Shot That Got Me Hooked as well. I was playing at the par-3 course in Hawaii Kai with some bandmates that had recently fallen prey to the addictive nature of the game. It was on the 5th hole. It was a stroke that felt exactly right from the moment I stood over the ball. It soared in a glorious, elegant arc and landed with a modest thud and rolled to about four inches from the cup. I&#8217;ll remember the sound of that ball landing for the rest of my life, as my friends gawked in silent reverence, and in disbelief, at what was very nearly a hole-in-one. Even I didn&#8217;t think I could play. Until then.</p>

<p>The elite professionals in each sport share similar privilege and affluence. They travel the world, pursuing what for the rest of us is a leisure activity. They enjoy the best conditions. And they get paid for it. They are the envy of just about anyone with a passion for either sport. And particularly here in Hawaii, the passion is not mutually exclusive. There was a stretch of years in my life when I was surfing, golfing, or planning one or the other when not working.</p>

<p>I have friends on the U.S. continent who keep golf balls and a pitching wedge in their vehicles at all times, in the event that a welcoming patch of grass might provide some chipping practice during lunch. I have friends who keep a board, a bar of wax, and surf trunks in their vehicles for precisely the same reason. There are famous golf professionals who are avid surfers, and famous surf professionals who are rabid golfers. There are surf nuts and there are golf nuts. Here in Hawaii, they are often the same person.</p>

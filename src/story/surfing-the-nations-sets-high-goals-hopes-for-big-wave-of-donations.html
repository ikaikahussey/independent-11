<p>WAHIAWA&#8212;Surfing the Nations (STN) has a goal to help the homeless, hungry, and to motivate people to stay off of drugs. The self described non-profit, humanitarian organization has come a long way since it began in Kalihi, finally settling into an old neighborhood bar in Wahiawa in 2008. STN has been making progress with cleaning up the old bar and 15-room apartment building upstairs, but is now looking to complete the dream plan for the community outreach building. </p>

<p>While organizing their usual statewide skate and surf contests and delivering food nationwide, volunteers have been working on renovation of the bar, which was built in the late 1930s. The renovation includes installing a commercial kitchen where STN will prepare meals as part of their Feed the Hungry program. </p>

<p>Founder Tom Bauer and the approximately 50 volunteers plan on providing training in food service, meal preparation for STN events, a coffee bar, and to provide a commercial kitchen for the community, something Wahiawa doesn’t have. Electrical, pluming, air conditioning, hiring an engineer, construction, and the remaining $100,000 from the initial purchase total $185,000.</p>

<p>According to Bauer, the bar will be open five nights a week with concert and open mic nights regularly. Promoting music and the arts, and providing after-school tutoring for at-risk youth are also part of the plan. Bauer says it will be a drug and alcohol free place for the community to gather. </p>

<p>The STN crew will serve hot meals to the hungry and those in need at least twice a week. A unique element to the building will be hot showers available for the island’s houseless.</p>

<p>The STN crew has their work cut out for them. But Bauer’s ideas haven’t stopped there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phase Two&#8221; of the project has been estimated at $1.5 million and includes a community outreach and training center which will offer a social service program and a food pantry to house the food STN gives out with Feed the Hungry. A family renewal center and a program call leading individuals to employment will also be constructed where attendees can learn to prepare for employment with training for how to apply for a job, how to fill out applications, and handle interviews. English as a second language classes will also be offered.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://surfingthenations.com/" title="STN website">STN website</a>, the organization has received approximately $300,000 in donations so far. Donations can be made on their website, and Bauer is asking for recurring monthly donations.</p>

<p>In 1998 STN made their first outreach trip to Indonesia when Bauer made a commitment to return each July for 10 years. Twelve years later, STN made their 12th trip to Indonesia and now has over 100 members all over the world.</p>

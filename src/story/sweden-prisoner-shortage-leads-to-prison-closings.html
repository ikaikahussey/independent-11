<p>Sweden is closing four prisons.</p>

<p>From Gizmodo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The issue isn&#8217;t lack of crime in Sweden—in fact, the crime rate has actually increased slightly there—but rather a strong emphasis on rehabilitating criminals, rather than locking them up. The prison population declined 6 percent between 2011 and 2012. In the United States, by comparison, federal facilities are 40 percent over capacity.</p>

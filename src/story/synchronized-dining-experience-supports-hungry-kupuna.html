<p>Lanakila Pacific is gearing up for its special 2010 signature event: &#8220;The Good Table.&#8221; Tickets go on sale to the public for this event on August 10 and continue through September 23</p>

<p>At exactly 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, October 7, over 50 restaurants across Oahu will serve special feasts for an exclusive table in their establishments. </p>

<p>&#8220;The Good Table&#8221; is a unique synchronized dining event. Participants sit down for dinner at the same time to benefit Lanakila Meals on Wheels, Hawaii’s largest and only island-wide meal provider to homebound kupuna. Proceeds will provide much needed funding to deliver more meals to kupuna who need help.</p>

dining experience. Tables are available for sale from August 10 through September 23.</p>

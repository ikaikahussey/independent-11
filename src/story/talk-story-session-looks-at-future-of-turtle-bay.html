<p>NORTH SHORE&#8212;The <a href="http://www.knsalliance.org/" target="_blank">Koolauloa North Shore Alliance</a> (KNSA) is hosting Talk Story 3, the latest in a series of community forums regarding the future of Turtle Bay. </p>

<p>The forum speakers, including Gov. Neil Abercrombie, will discuss the Hawaii State Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling requiring the resort developer to conduct a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) and prospects for the preservation of the undeveloped lands at Turtle Bay. This forum will allow community members to ask questions of resort representatives, elected officials, and community leaders, as well as present their own ideas for alternatives to the development of rural lands. </p>

<p>Talk Story 3 will inform the community about how the SEIS process works and how residents and visitors can comment on the draft SEIS document that is anticipated to be released in the summer of 2011.</p>

<p>The meeting format will include brief statements by invited speakers followed by ample time for community Q&amp;A and discussions. </p>

<p>Turtle Bay owners contracted Replay Resorts to oversee the ongoing management of hotel and golf operations as well as the real estate development program at Turtle Bay. Replay Resorts is currently working on the design of a new master plan for the rersort. SEIS Consultant Lee Sichter will present an overview of Supplemental Environmental Impact Statements. Sichter is leading the preparation of the SEIS for Replay Resorts. Replay Resorts representative Drew Stotesbury will also be on hand for questions. </p>

<p>Cathleen Mattoon, Punaluu resident member of former-Gov. Linda Lingle’s Turtle Bay Advisory Working Group will discuss the group’s goals and creative ways to finance the acquisition of the area for public use.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tim Vandeveer will speak on behalf of the Koolauloa North Shore Alliance.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As with past Talk Story events in 2008 and 2009, KNSA member and Kaaawa resident Dee Dee Letts will be the moderator.&nbsp; </p>

<p>KNSA is a diverse and committed group of individuals, associations, businesses, and leaders who have joined together to strongly support the permanent protection of the undeveloped lands mauka and makai of the Turtle Bay Resort in the moku of Koolauloa on the North Shore of Oahu.

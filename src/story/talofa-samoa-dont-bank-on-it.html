<p>American Samoa will soon be without a US bank, with the just-around-the-corner exit of Bank of Hawaii from the territory. And with $97 million in deposit, there&#8217;s a lot at stake. <a href="http://www.khon2.com/content/news/developingstories/story/Federal-Reserve-Bank-plans-hearing-on-BANKOHS/9LZYbFpoiEq4ckT4PvY8gA.cspx?rss=2433">Federal hearings are scheduled for later today</a>.</p>

<p>But this is also an opportunity for our southern neighbors to reevaluate the wisdom of ceding investments to a bank which they don&#8217;t own or control. </p>

<p>Which is why it&#8217;s heartening to learn that the governor of American Samoa has <a href="http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=73181">taken steps to establish a local credit union</a>. Essentially a nonprofit, community-controlled bank, a credit union ensures local control for local assets. A good move, and probably overdue.</p>

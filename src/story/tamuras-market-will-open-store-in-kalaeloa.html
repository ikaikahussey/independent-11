<p>Tamura’s Market is set to open a grocery store in the vacated space formerly used by the Naval Air Station Barbers Point Commissary at Kalaeloa, near Kapolei High School.</p>

<p>Glenn Tamura, president of Tamura Enterprises Inc., signed a lease two weeks ago with Hunt Development Group to take over the 12,000-square-foot space, <a href="http://pacific.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2010/10/04/story4.html" title="Pacific Business News reported.">Pacific Business News reported.</a> He will have a five-year lease with an option to extend another five years during the lease.</p>

<p>Tamura expects to spend $500,000 to renovate, purchase equipment and stock the old Navy commissary. Construction of the new store will be done in-house for the next two months, with hopes to be open before Christmas.</p>

<p>The store is located on 91-1051 Enterprise Ave.</p>

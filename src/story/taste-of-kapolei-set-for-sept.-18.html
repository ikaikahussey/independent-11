<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;For the past decade, Taste at Kapolei has been one of featured events that attract people to Oahu&#8217;s west side. Celebrating its 10th anniversary, the food and drink tasting event coming back in full steam on September 18.</p>

<p>Organized by the Rotary Club of Kapolei, Taste at Kapolei helps fundraise money for the youth and community groups on the Leeward side including funds for schools and scholarships for students. </p>

<p>With over 1,500 in attendance last year, many are anxious to get a taste of what&#8217;s in store for this year’s event. As Anuhea and Sean Naauao are a few of the headlining acts to entertain the crowd, more than 20 restaurant owners with their chefs at hand will fill the grass area of the Ko Olina Resort and Marina, cooking up many signature dishes ranging from Japanese and Thai to Itatalian and Pacific Rim flavors.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The 2010 lineup of restaurants includes Formaggio Grill, En Fuego Grill &amp; Poke, Indigo Restaurant, PF Chang’s China Bistro, Sovaly Thai Cuisine, A Cup of Tea, Highyway Inn, Soul Patrol, and more. </p>

<p>Some of the distinguished chefs have already presented their dishes they will be cooking up for the evening. According to Taste of Kapolei, guests in attendance will be able to enjoy, to name a few dishes, the traditional kalua pig from Highway Inn, peppercorn-crusted fish fillets from Indigo Restaurant, and smoke beef brisket with garlic broccoli mashed potatoes from Formaggio Grill. And to wrap it up, Menchie’s Frozen Yogurt will be in attendance for the sweet tooth in everyone. </p>

<p>For those bringing their keiki with them, there will be a featured Kids’ Zone, and there will be a silent action and fireworks display to end the event’s evening. </p>

<p>Tickets for general admission are still on sale to the Kapolei feast&#8212; presale price is $75 and $90 at the door. There are also VIP tickets available, as guests will be treated to a specially created menu for the evening by a line of top chefs on Island, including Darryl Shinogi from Roy’s Ko Olina, Chai Chaowasaree of Chai’s Island Bistro, Russell Sui from 3660 on the Rise, and Abigail Langlas of Cakeworks providing the desert. </p>

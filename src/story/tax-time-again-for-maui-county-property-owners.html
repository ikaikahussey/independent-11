<p>MAUI&#8212;The County of Maui&#8217;s Real Property Tax Division announced that real property taxes are due on Monday August 22 for the first installment of fiscal year 2011-2012. The deadline set by the Maui County Code of August 20 falls on a Saturday, thereby making this year’s deadline the following business day, Monday the 22nd.</p>

<p>Real Property tax bills from the County of Maui have been mailed to property owners or the agents servicing their accounts. Property owners who pay their real property taxes directly and who have not received a real property tax bill should check on their taxes by contacting the County of Maui Real Property Tax Division by phone at (808) 270-7697, in person at the Maui Mall Service Center (Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.), or online at <a href="http://www.mauipropertytax.com" target="_blank">www.mauipropertytax.com</a>.</p>

<p>The Real Property Tax Division is offering electronic payment options for Real Property Taxes. Electronic payments are accepted via the internet or phone. This service is being offered through a private vendor Link2Gov. The service provider will be charging a convenience fee. These fees are not being collected by the County of Maui. To make an electronic payment it is a good idea to have your tax bill on hand because you will need your 13 digit tax map key number. </p>

<p>Maui County officials are reminding property owners that failure to pay their taxes on time because of non-receipt of a tax bill will not excuse them from being assessed a 10 percent penalty plus interest at the rate of 12 percent per year. Unless hand delivered on time, the United States Postal Service cancellation mark is the date of receipt by the County of Maui. It is the taxpayer’s responsibility when sending via postal mail to assure that all envelopes are timely postmarked by the USPS on or before August 22, 2011.</p>

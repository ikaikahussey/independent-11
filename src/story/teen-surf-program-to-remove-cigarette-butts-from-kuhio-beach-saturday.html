<p>WAIKIKI&#8212;<a href="http://www.surferspirit.org/butt busters" target="_blank">Surfrider Spirit Sessions</a>, a nonprofit organization that uses surfing to and volunteer mentors to help at-risk teens in the Juvenile Court get out of trouble, begins its Butt Busters campaign on Saturday, June 25 at Kuhio Beach in Waikiki. The program continues each Saturday for eight weeks.</p>

<p>The group seeks the publicâ€™s support of mentors and teens in the program as they remove cigarette butts from the beach. Cigarette butts contain deadly toxins and threaten green sea turtles, or honu, which mistake the butts for food. Just 10 cigarette butts are enough to kill a turtle.</p>

Supporters are invited to make a modest pledge of a penny or two for each cigarette butt removed from the beach. An average of 500 butts are removed at each beach cleanup, and this year Surfrider Spirit Sessions hopes to improve on its average and remove 6000 cigarette butts during the program. The final butt count will be announced on Saturday, August 20.</p>

<p>Since its beginning in 2006, Surfrider Spirit Sessions has helped dozens of at-risk youth turn their lives around by teaching them about surfing, the ocean, Hawaiian Culture, environmental science and the importance of being part of their community. Participants discover their own sense of importance, and the significant positive impact they can have on their families, friends, community, and the environment.</p>

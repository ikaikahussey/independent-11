<p>KANEOHE&#8212;A traffic lane on Aumoku Street between Kaneohe Bay Drive and Meakaua Street will be temporarily adjusted 24-hours per day, for five consecutive days from Monday, March 7 through Friday, March 11 due to construction of a concrete bus pad on the mauka side of Aumoku Street. </p>

<p>Traffic cones will be used to temporarily narrow the Kailua-bound traffic lane fronting the existing bus stop on Aumoku Street to provide space for construction of the bus pad. The Kahuluu-bound lane of Aumoku Street will not be affected. </p>

<p>During construction, motorists are advised to use caution in this area and are encouraged to use alternative routes.</p>

<p>Bus patrons normally using the Aumoku Street bus stop between Kaneohe Bay Drive and the Windward City driveway opposite Meakaua Street are asked to use the temporary bus stop located on Aumoku Street between Meakaua Street and Koa Kahiko Street fronting 24 Hour Fitness. </p>

<p>From a <a href="http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2005/Jan/05/bz/bz05p.html">2005 Honolulu Advertiser report by Gordon Pang</a> on a move by Carleton Ching, Ige ªs nominee to DLNR, to remove regulations on development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Housing developers told legislators yesterday that it takes too long to get government approvals and urged them to streamline the land-use process, in part by reducing the role of the state Land Use Commission.</p>

<p>The lack of affordable housing is &#8220;a supply-and-demand issue,&#8221; said Carleton Ching, director of community and governmental relations for Castle &amp; Cooke Homes. The housing supply cannot meet the demand when applications for such projects are tied up in the lengthy permit process, he said.</p>

<p>Ching was one of a number of developers who appeared before the Senate&#8217;s task force on affordable housing yesterday. Streamlining the land-use process was among the suggestions made in a report issued Monday by a government and private industry task force coordinated by the Housing and Community Development Corp. of Hawai&#8217;i.</p>

<p>It often takes four years to obtain approvals from the Land Use Commission and another two more years to get county permits, Ching said, &#8220;and then you go get the (building) permits after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Asked by one senator how long it should take to approve a housing development, Ching deadpanned, &#8220;Just sign a document and tell us go,&#8221; drawing laughter from yesterday&#8217;s participants.</p>

Curtis notes that in 2008 Calvin Say advanced <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2008/bills/HB2863_HD1_.htm">HB 2683</a>, which would have also abolished the LUC. That bill was killed by the State Senate.</p>

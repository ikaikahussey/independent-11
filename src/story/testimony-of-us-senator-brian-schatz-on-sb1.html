<p>Linda Schatz, spouse of US Senator Brian Schatz, delivered his testimony this morning on SB1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now is the time for Hawaii to grant full equality under the law to our LGBT friends, family, and neighbors. I am writing to urge you into passing same-sex marriage during this special legislative session.</p>

<p>For too long, same-sex couples have been denied the same rights, benefits, and protections that everyone deserves. I urge you to pass this important legislation, so that same-sex couples can be treated equally under the law.</p>

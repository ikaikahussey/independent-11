<p>Genevieve Salmonson&#8217;s confirmation hearing was cancelled.&nbsp; A lot of people including myself submitted testimony on her appointment to the Senate Committee on Energy and the Environment.&nbsp; I think that the testimony is public record and should be posted on line.&nbsp; However, methinks that the Governor withdrew the nomination after reading all testimonies submitted. As Marjorie Ziegler said, discussion of Salmonson goes beyond the Superferry.&nbsp; The public has a right to see what transpired in this discussion.&nbsp; How can I send you a PDF of my testimony?</p>

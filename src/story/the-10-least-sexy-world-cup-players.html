<p>BOSTON&#8212;If you&#8217;ve been following media coverage of the World Cup these past few weeks you might think every footballer is a chiseled god&#8212;ripped, handsome, and oozing sex appeal.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d be wrong.</p>

<p>These World Cup 2010 players won&#8217;t be featured in <i>Vanity Fair, Cosmopolitan</i> or <i>The Daily Beast</i> for their looks.</p>

<p>The men on the list below have been chosen by <i>GlobalPost</i> because they are un-sexy in some way or another. Some lack physical beauty, others lack inner beauty, a few lack both. And while many redeem themselves with skills on the field, we just don&#8217;t want to see them in their skivvies.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Franck_Ribery_0.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>1. Franck Ribery - France</b><br />
Yes, he has a scar as the result of an accident when he was 2. But that&#8217;s not why Ribery, one of France&#8217;s stars, makes the list. He was recently accused of <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/22/sports/main6422027.shtml" title="hiring an underage prostitute">hiring an underage prostitute</a>. That&#8217;s just not sexy.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Rooney_0.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>2. Wayne Rooney&#8212;England</b><br />
Yes, Wayne Rooney’s ears stick out from his perfectly round face making him look like Shrek. Indeed, England’s Rooney was just named the ugliest soccer player in the world, at least according to 33 percent of the 2,500 women polled by <a href="http://www.thepeoplesclub.com" title="www.thepeoplesclub.com">www.thepeoplesclub.com</a>. But he (usually) scores, which makes him a fan favorite.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Carles_Puyol_.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>3. Carles Puyol&#8212;Spain</b><br />
Things are looking hairy for Spain in the 2010 World Cup, and Carles Puyol isn&#8217;t the only reason.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Carlos_Tevez.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>4. Carlos Tevez&#8212;Argentina</b><br />
He has a widow&#8217;s peak. But also a unibrow. Enough said.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Lee_Woon-Jae.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>5. Lee Woon-Jae&#8212;South Korea</b><br />
South Korea&#8217;s goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae is nicknamed &#8216;Spider Hands’ for his skills in the net. But those hands got him in trouble in 2007, when Woon-Jae and three of his teammates started <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sc20071101a1.html" title="messing around with prostitutes">messing around with prostitutes</a> on the eve of the country&#8217;s Asian Cup match.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Peter_Crouch.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>6. Peter Crouch - England</b><br />
Peter Crouch&#8212;the tallest England player at 6’7’’&#8212;makes for one awkward and gangly soccer player. And he knows it. In an interview, when asked what he would be if he weren’t a soccer player, Crouch replied: “A virgin.”</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Marcus_Tulio_Tanaka.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>7. Marcus Tulio Tanaka&#8212;Japan</b><br />
Only one month ago, Marcus Tulio Tanaka of Japan acted like a child on the playing field. He got frustrated with the referee and marched around with his shirt on his head. This performance led one website to select him for the No. 1 <a href="http://www.101greatgoals.com/tantrum-of-the-week-marcus-tulio-tanaka-nagoya-grampus-eight-vs-kashima-antlers/55473/" title="“tantrum of the week.&quot;">“tantrum of the week.&#8221;</a> Sexy.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Jong_Tae-Se.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>8. Jong Tae-Se&#8212;North Korea</b><br />
North Korea’s Jong Tae-Se didn’t look so hot as he burst into tears before the Brazil-North Korea match. But the emotion seems genuine: Born in Japan to South Korean parents, Tae-Se traded his South Korean citizenship for a North Korean passport just so that he could play for Kim Jong-il&#8217;s team. Really?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Sotirios_Kyrgiakos.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>9. Sotirios Kyrygiakos&#8212;Greece</b><br />
Sotirios Kyrgiakos, 31, is only one of the many seasoned 30-something players on the Greek team, which has a 71-year-old coach. So if the early bird special is your idea of sexy, go Greece!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/centerwell/Maradona.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>10. Argentina coach Diego Maradona</b><br />
Before the start of the tournament, Argentinean coach Diego Maradona promised to run naked through the center of Buenos Aires if Argentina wins the 2010 World Cup. We&#8217;d prefer he kept his pants on.</p>

<p><b>11. Koman Coulibaly (bonus pick)</b><br />
In one bad call, which may have cost the U.S. team a win Friday against Slovenia, Malian Koman Coulibaly became the least sexy referee in the world. At least for Americans. </p>

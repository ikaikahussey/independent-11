<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Actors Group presents the play <em>A Delicate Balance </em>beginning Friday, June 24 for a three-week run at the Dole Cannery Theater. </p>

<p><em>A Delicate Balance</em> won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize, and enjoyed a hugely successful revival on Broadway in 1996.</p>

<p>In the play, a wealthy middle-aged couple, Agnes and Tobias, share their home with Agnesâ€™ witty, alcoholic sister in an uneasy alliance of denial and confrontation. Complacency is shattered when old friends appear at the doorstep, claiming an encroaching, nameless &#8220;fear&#8221; has forced them from their own home, and their daughter returns home from a fourth failed marriage. Doubt, recrimination and ultimately solace, upsets the &#8220;delicate balance&#8221; of the household. </p>

<p>The Actors Group became a member of the State Theater Council in 1999.</p>

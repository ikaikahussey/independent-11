<p><em>HAUNTED GARAGE</em> is an artistic, frightening attraction produced by The ARTS at Marks Garage.&nbsp; <em>HAUNTED GARAGE</em> will transform the entire gallery and performance space, taking inspiration from partner organizations.&nbsp; Some rooms to beware of: Gallery of Horrors, Starving Artists Attack, Sad Clown/Psycho Clown &amp; Wicked Witches of Shakespeare. </p>

There are many roles for men and women of all ages, ages 16 and up.&nbsp; Speaking, non-speaking and “screaming” roles are available. <br />

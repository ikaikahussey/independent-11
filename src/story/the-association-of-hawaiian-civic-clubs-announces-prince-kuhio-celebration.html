<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Faith, hope, and charity. These traits were attributed to Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole Piʻikoi in <a href="http://aohcc.org/images/stories/2011/Kuhio%20history.jpg" target="_blank">a January 1923 U.S. Congressional Record</a> in remembrance of the former Congressional delegate and royal Hawaiian as a man who cultivated the healing process for the people of Hawaii, who were losing their identity as a sovereign people.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prince never failed of an opportunity to impress upon his native people the importance of maintaining their race and of establishing and maintaining a home of their own,&#8221; the Congressional Record stated. &#8220;His purpose was to perpetuate as long as possible the vanishing race of the Hawaiians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince Kuhio was a nephew of King Kalakaua and Queen Kapiolani. After the overthrow, the prince became Hawaii&#8217;s second delegate to the U.S. Congress. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1921 and the Hawaiian Civic Clubs movement are his legacies. Prince Kuhio&#8217;s home was named Pualeilani, meaning &#8220;royal garland of flowers,&#8221; and was located in Waikiki at what is now Kuhio Beach.</p>

<p>Prince Kuhio is remembered each year on Prince Kuhio Day, March 26, for his resolve in standing up for Hawaiian independence, organizing local government systems still used today, and founding the first Hawaiian Civic Club in 1918.</p>

<p>The Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs announced a series of events connected with the celebration of Prince Kuhio Day. The month-long celebration will culminate in the Prince Kuhio Day Parade in Waikiki on March 26. </p>

<p>Sponsored by the Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Kamehameha Schools, and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, these events promise opportunities to explore and celebrate the many facets of Hawaiian culture.</p>

<p>On March 5, the Holoku Ball was hosted by the members of the Hawaiian Civic Club of Honolulu to raise scholarship funds for Hawaiian students and to recognize notable persons and or businesses in the community who have contributed significantly to the Native Hawaiian culture. This year&#8217;s honorees were Judge Thomas K. Kaulukukui, Jr. (retired), Chair, Board of Trustees, Queen Liliuokalani Trust; Leinaala Kalama Heine, Kumu Hula, Na Pua O Likolehua; Dr. Isabella Kauakea Aiona Abbott, Educator, Ethnobotanist (posthumous).</p>

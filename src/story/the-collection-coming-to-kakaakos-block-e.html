<p>Kamehameha Schools and A&amp;B Properties Inc., a subsdiary of Alexander &amp; Baldwin, announced plans to develop the former CompUSA site, also known as &#8220;Block E.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new development will be called &#8220;The Collection,&#8221; and is slated to include a high-rise tower, a mid-rise building, town homes, and retail shops and restaurants. </p>

<p>Condominium sales for the high-rise are scheduled to begin this summer. The project is designed for the local market, with prices in the high-rise tower starting in the high $300,000s for one- bedroom units, mid $500,000s for two-bedroom units, and mid $700,000s for three-bedroom units.</p>

<p>According to the press release, A&amp;B holds an option to acquire the site from Kamehameha Schools. The release also provides more details:</p>

<blockquote><p>The 43-story high-rise tower is designed to include approximately 400 modern, one-, two- and three- bedroom residences, most with beautiful ocean views in either the Diamond Head or ‘Ewa directions. The four-story mid-rise contemplates approximately 50 flats—primarily studios and a select number of one- and two-bedroom residences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amenities in the new development sound attractive, with a pool, outdoor lounge, fitness center, clubroom, and private dog park within the tower.</p>

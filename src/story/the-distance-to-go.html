<p><em>Above: Emma Nawahi led a women&#8217;s group opposing a new government which would deny voting rights to women, at the same time as women in the US were working for the vote.</em></p>

<p>Today is the 100th International Women&#8217;s Day – an opportunity to celebrate advances in gender and sex equality, but also the distance we&#8217;ve yet to traverse.</p>

<p>Here in Hawaii, we&#8217;re fortunate to live in a society with a rich history of strong female leaders, both ancient and modern. La‘ila‘i, Haumea, Pele, Ka‘ahumanu, Lili‘u, Nawahi (pictured above). And modern, too – Patsy Mink, Linda Lingle, our current Congressional delegation, and the leaders who are writing in our &#8220;State of Women&#8221; series. </p>

<p>We should be proud of our matriarchal roots, but it&#8217;s a pride that has purchase in juxtaposition with a modern economy and society which is punishing for most humans, the majority of whom are women. Mari Matsuda <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/violence-misogyny-economy-and-reproductive-freedom">sums it up</a> well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Issues that affect working families affect women, since we have a disproportionate share of the load of keeping families going: childcare, eldercare, health care, housing, attacks on labor, disappearing pensions. All economic justice issues are women’s issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Cathy Betts, head of the government&#8217;s own Commission on the Status of Women, points out that women&#8217;s rights advocates have labored for <a href="Violence, misogyny, economy, and reproductive freedom">17 years</a> to materialize a law that would provide emergency contraceptives to survivors of sexual violence. Here&#8217;s to hoping that the Legislature will finally pass HB 411.</p>

<p>To take one tangible local example: the Department of Education, which is staffed predominantly with women, doesn&#8217;t offer child care or paid maternity leave for its employees. Teachers are forced to choose between providing care for their child, or to educate someone else&#8217;s child. If there were ever an institution that should know the value of paid family leave, it would be the DOE.</p>

<p>By contrast, our cold cousins to the south can take up to 14 weeks of paid parental leave. The Economist – not exactly the barometer of equal rights – also rated New Zealand as <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/03/daily-chart-3">the best country for female workers</a>, by examining five factors: the number of men and women respectively with tertiary education; female labour-force participation; the male-female wage gap; the proportion of women in senior jobs; and child-care costs relative to the average wage.</p>

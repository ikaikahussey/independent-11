<p>The annual <a href="http://friendsofthelibraryofhawaii.org">Friends of the Library of Hawaii</a> used book sale starts this weekend at McKinley High School. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick look at the sale, by the numbers.</p>

<p><strong>1. 150,000 books</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a lot of books.</p>

<p><strong>2. 100 volunteers</strong><br />
The Friends usually has 100 volunteers â€“</p>

<p><strong>3. 400 to make the sale happen</strong><br />
but it takes a crew four times that to pul off the sale.</p>

<p><strong>4. $200,000</strong><br />
The Friends of the Library of Hawaii hopes to earn $200,000 in gross receipts from the sale. They&#8217;re helped in this effort by <a href="https://www.hsfcu.com">Hawaii State Federal Credit Union</a>, which is underwriting the sale.</p>

<p><strong>5. Five pop-ups!</strong><br />
This year, the sale features pop-up sales during the weekdays. Mysteries on Monday; military on Tuesday; history on Wednesday; literature and religion on Thursday; and biographies, sci-fi, and historical fiction on Friday. The pop-ups run from 11 am to 7 pm.</p>

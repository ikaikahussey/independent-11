<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;The Malama Learning Center has introduced a new test pilot program for Leeward Oahu high school and college students aimed at providing education and inspiration to pursue possible careers in the Hawaii&#8217;s growing “green” field. </p>

<p>The Malama Learning Center (MLC), a Kapolei based non-profit organization, has teamed up with the Native Hawaiian Student Support Program at Leeward Community College to start the Hawaii Green Collar institute, which focuses on helping Native Hawaiians and other students on Oahu&#8217;s west side transition from high school to college and the work force.</p>

<p>The Hawaii Green Collar Institute introduces students first hand to environmental and climate change issues in their surrounding communities. Students enrolled in the program will engage with speakers and presentations and take field trips to get a hands-on grasp of how various &#8220;green&#8221; jobs are affecting the community.</p>

<p>“Our main goal if for them to really understand what environmental issues there are in their own community, more than just the basic litter,” said Pauline Sato, MLC&#8217;s program director. “We want to raise awareness by encouraging the youth to pursue a career field that will help take care of the environment. We want to help guide a student that doesn’t necessarily have that type of guidance at home.”</p>

<p>Initially funded from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Ka Papa O Kakuhihewa Fund, the institute&#8217;s sessions last four weekends over a five-month period. </p>

<p>The 30-student group, which has a few spots left, will learn about agriculture, waste and recycling, and stream and ocean pollution. </p>

<p>Throughout the program, the students will also work on team projects with an end-of-the-year presentation displaying a specific environmental issue, a solution, and careers pertaining to the issue. </p>

<p>“Even though the program is only for students, we want to raise awareness to everyone,&#8221; Sato said. &#8220;We want everyone, not just the youth, to see how they can take advantage of contributing to their community by maybe pursuing an actual career in the green world and not just see it as a volunteer thing.”</p>

<p>The institute sessions are October 29 and 30, 2010, January 7 and 8, February 18 and 19, and March 4 and 5 of 2011. Student will receive $200 for completion. The program will also continue to offer support upon completion to help connect students to more experiences in the green job field. </p>

<p>“We don’t expect all 30 participants to go green, but at the minimum gain awareness and live a little more sustainably,” Sato said.</p>

<p>While MLC is still in the process of building its center, neighboring Kapolei High School is continuously pushing toward the education of art, science, conservation, and culture to promote sustainable living. </p>

<p>Initially hoping to break ground for construction this fall, MLC&#8217;s plans have been pushed to next year. MLC is currently still in the fundraising stage and building permit process, but will continue to inform the public and hold classes and presentations until the MLC is built. </p>

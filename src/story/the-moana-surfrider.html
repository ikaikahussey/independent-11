<p>Built in 1901 by Oliver G. Traphagen (who also designed the Kalihi-Palama firehouse), the Moana is the oldest hotel in Waikiki, opening at a time when most visitors to Honolulu occupied rooms in the downtown area. The impressive two story-high porte cochere presented the citizens of the new territory with another manifestation of the <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_l/special_programs/honors_program/hudsonfulton_celebra/homepage/progressive_movement/">City Beautiful</a> movement. Traphagen adapted America’s “Colonial style” to meet Hawaii’s climatic needs via large openings and a broad lanai.</p>

<p>Guests have included the Duke of Windsor, Amelia Earhart, Joe DiMaggio, Walter Chrysler, Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, Boris Karloff, Loretta Young – and perhaps you.</p>

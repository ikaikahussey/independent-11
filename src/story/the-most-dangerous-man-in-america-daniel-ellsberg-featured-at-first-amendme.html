<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Can exposing government secrets to the world be an act of moral courage? Daniel Ellsberg is an economist and a former Marine who, during the Vietnam War, worked for the Pentagon, the State Department and as a RAND Corporation military analyst. Confronted with internal reports exposing four administrations’ blatant lies to Congress and the public in order to perpetuate U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, Ellsberg was faced with an unthinkable dilemma: Keep quiet, and let more people die&#8212;or do something, and risk everything.</p>

<p>In 1969, Ellsberg made his choice. He smuggled a copy of the Pentagon’s 7,000-page secret history of the Vietnam War, which came to be known as the &#8220;Pentagon Papers,” to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1971, when it became clear that the committee never intended to act on the Pentagon Papers, Ellesberg leaked them to the <i>New York Times</i>. The firestorm that ensued galvanized the anti-war movement, shook confidence in the U.S. government, and is largely credited with driving the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Henry Kissinger proclaimed him “the most dangerous man in America.” Ellsberg, hero to some, traitor to others, faced the full ire of the Nixon Administration, including charges under the Espionage Act and threats of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Ellsberg’s impact continues to resonate in current events where a constant struggle exists to limit government secrecy and ensure the public’s right to know what is being done in the name of national interests.</p>

<p>The Davis Levin First Amendment Conference on Saturday, November 13 features Ellsberg in Hawaii, where he will share his perspective on moral courage, the Pentagon Papers and excessive government secrecy. Moderated by Aviam Soifer, dean of the University of Hawaii William S. Richardson School of Law, the conference will include a screening of the Academy Award-nominated documentary about the Pentagon Papers: <i>The Most Dangerous Man in America.</i></p>

<p>The conference, first established in 1997, is a discussion between prominent constitutional thinkers fostering awareness and dialogue about the freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. The conference is a public education project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii Foundation funded with grants from the Robert M. Rees Trust and the law firm of Davis Levin Livingston. The Conference is named for attorneys Mark S. Davis and Stanley E. Levin for their work defending the First Amendment in Hawaii.</p>

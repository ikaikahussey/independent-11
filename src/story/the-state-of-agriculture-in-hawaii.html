<p>* Less than 2 percent of the population is involved in agriculture which means that farmers do not have much representation in State and County Government.</p>

<p>* There is great pressure to convert existing agriculture land into residential and resort properties both in Hawaii and across the U.S. mainland. This occurs for many reasons: Gentleman estates on agricultural land are taxed at very low rates; while converting land from agricultural to residential and tourist zoning is very lucrative. </p>

<p>* On islands that could grow enormous amounts of food, about one-fifth of Hawaii residents live in food insecure households. The highest risk food insecure community is Waiâ€™anae where about one-third of the residents live in food insecure households. </p>

<p>* Historically, Waianae was an agricultural self-sufficient region. However, the removal of land for the military and the diversion of water severely cramped the region. Mao Farms was created to address critical needs within Waianae. They focus on five critical areas: out-of-school youth, health, agriculture, sustainable economic development, and Hawaiian culture. They aim to &#8220;build a localized movement to put the value of aloha aina into action.&#8221; </p>

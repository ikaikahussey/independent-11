<p>The Venue on Bethel Street is hosting a night of original local music and dance on Friday, bringing in some of Honolulu’s notable and successful indie acts. The Venue is touted as a performance space with an impeccable sound quality unrivaled among small venues. </p>

<p>On the bill Friday night are Kings of Spade, Tavana, Mano Kane, the Shakti Dance Movement, Giinko Maraschino, and DJs A2Z and TKO. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/kingsofspade" title="Kings of Spade">Kings of Spade</a> are fronted by Kasey Nunez, a powerful female vocalist reminiscent of Janis Joplin with a soulful twist of funk.<a href="http://www.myspace.com/tavanamusic" title=" Tavana McMoore"> Tavana McMoore</a>, who now lives part time in Austin, Texas, is a true guitar virtuoso in the style of Steveie Ray Vaughn and is among the most electrifying performers ever to come out of Honolulu. <a href="http://www.manokane.com" title="Mano Kane">Mano Kane</a> has been likened to The Beatles, with irresistible hooks and lush vocal harmonies. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/shaktidancemovement" title="Shakti Dance Movement">Shakti Dance Movement</a> is certainly the most accomplished, and mesmerizing, belly dance troupe in the island. Giinko Maraschino has been described as “art dance craziness,” and rightfully so.</p>

<p>With veteran deejays to to keep things going between bands and dancers, this concert at the venue promises to be well worth the modest cover charge.</p>

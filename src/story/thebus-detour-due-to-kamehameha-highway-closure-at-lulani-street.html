<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Due to the continued closure of Kamehameha Highway, between Kahekili Highway and Lulani Street, TheBus is revising its detour in the area. </p>

<p>The route 55, Circle Island, will be rerouted to Kahekili Highway after 7:00 a.m. daily on all trips except for the last eastbound and westbound trips. The rerouted route 55 will not service Kamehameha Highway between Haiku Road (near Windward Mall) and Kahekili Highway (near the Hygienic Store). </p>

<p>The route 65 will continue to service this segment of Kamehameha Highway and will continue to detour through Lulani in both the eastbound and westbound directions to provide bus service to area residents. A temporary bus stop will be provided at the Kamehameha Highway/Heeia Street intersection for both east and westbound Route 65 trips. Bus riders heading to King Intermediate School will need to get off the bus at this temporary stop.</p>

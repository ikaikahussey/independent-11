<p><i>The following is an excerpt from Life Foundation&#8217;s press release regarding Sunday&#8217;s Honolulu Aids Walk at Kapiolani Park:</i></p>

<p>Registration is now open for the 19th Annual Honolulu AIDS Walk, to be held on Sunday, April 18 at the Kapiolani Park Bandstand&#8212;the event opens at 8:00 a.m. for walker check-in and pre-walk entertainment, and the Honolulu AIDS Walk starts at 9:00 am. Walkers can register as individuals or as a team online at <a href="http://www.honoluluaidswalk.org" title="www.honoluluaidswalk.org">www.honoluluaidswalk.org</a>. Registration brochures are available at Starbucks, Rip Curl, and Lululemon Athletica, and Kaiser Permanente locations.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Honolulu AIDS Walk is a benefit for Life Foundation, a local organization that provides free HIV testing and services for people living with HIV/AIDS on Oahu. It is estimated that 3,000 people in Hawaii are living with HIV or AIDS. Approximately 40,000 new HIV infections occur each year in the United States&#8212;half of these among individuals under the age of 25. </p>

<p>Last year, the Honolulu AIDS Walk attracted 4,000 participants and raised more than $150,000 for Life Foundation. This year, 5,000 walkers are expected and the goal is to raise more than $200,000. The Honolulu AIDS Walk is an easy 5k (3 mile) walk around Kapiolani Park, and features great entertainment, on-stage give-aways, a kid zone with inflatable bouncers, and food booths.</p>

<p>Walkers raise money by asking friends and family to sponsor their participation in the Honolulu AIDS Walk. There is no fundraising minimum or registration fee to attend the event. Teams remain an important part of the Walk&#8217;s success and participants can form teams with friends or co-workers to encourage and promote their fundraising efforts. Prizes are given for the top fundraising teams, top fundraising individuals, and teams with the best AIDS ribbon themed costume. A special prize is given to the top fundraising high school team.</p>

<p>Those who raise $100 or more will receive a free commemorative Honolulu AIDS Walk t-shirt. Participants in high school teams need only raise $75 to receive a t-shirt. Volunteers are also needed on the day of the walk to help set up, clean up, handle registration, and direct walkers. </p>

<p>MANOA&#8212;A funny thing happened at the Manoa Neighborhood Board last week, <a href="http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/main/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2991/Manoa-Liberals-block-Eagle-Scout-from-Neighborhood-Board.aspx" title="summarized here by Eric Marshall">summarized here by Eric Marshall</a>, a Republican candidate for State Senate District 10. As part of its meeting agenda, the board was looking to fill a vacant seat. Zach Thomson, a business owner, Eagle Scout Local Den Leader, father, husband, and Manoa resident approached the board to fill that vacancy. Thing is, Thomson is also a Republican candidate for Manoa&#8217;s State House District 24.</p>

<p>The only criteria to serve on the Manoa Neighborhood Board is that you reside in Manoa and are able to attend a monthly meeting held on the first Wednesday of each month. Candidates for elected state office are not prohibited to serve on the board. </p>

<p>However, it was when Thomson disclosed that he was a Republican candidate that opposition came forth from the board.</p>

<p>One of the board&#8217;s most vocal opponents to Thomson&#8217;s admittance, Marshall said, was Tom Heinrich, a staffer of Democratic Sen. Brian Taniguchi, who represents Manoa, Moiliili, McCully, and Makiki. </p>

<p>Following the vote to not admit Thomson, former board chair Nadine Nishioka, who was present at the meeting, and current member Kimberly Case voiced their &#8220;disgust&#8221; with the decision to not let Thomson on the board. Case has since filed a complaint with the Board Commission.</p>

<p>Thomson told <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> that he was shocked that the board refused help from someone who just wants to improve Manoa and loan his time and resources to the community. We&#8217;ll be following up with the Board Commission&#8217;s opinion on the decision.</p>

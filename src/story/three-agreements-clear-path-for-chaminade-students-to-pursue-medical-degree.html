<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Chaminade University has entered into agreements with three major medical programs, which will provide easier access to postgraduate degrees for those students seeking careers in medicine or healthcare.<br />
 <br />
Chaminade has signed an agreement with Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), which gives better access for qualified underrepresented students to pursue dreams of becoming medical doctors. Chaminade students can now participate in the Early Medical School Selection Program (EMSSP), a partnership between BUSM and 13 universities that emphasize early admissions and curriculum coordination.<br />
 <br />
A. T. Still University (ATSU) and Chaminade University have entered into two articulation agreements that will open new doors for qualified Chaminade students who want to become doctors of osteopathic medicine. Qualified students can now take advantage of the Stills Scholars Pre-Osteopathic Early Acceptance Program, designed to provide early admission to the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine. Qualified students can also apply as candidates to ATSU Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine/ Chaminade University Early Admission Program. Students who successfully complete program requirements at Chaminade can then take advantage of reserved seats at Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine.<br />
 <br />
Western University of Health Sciences is partnering with Chaminade University in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide a pipeline for its undergraduate students to enter Western U’s Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program. The linkage agreement is designed to admit qualified Chaminade applicants to Western University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific (COMP) in Pomona, Calif., and a Lebanon, Ore. campus that is scheduled to open in 2011.<br />
  <br />
Celebrating more than 50 years, Chaminade University offers programs of study grounded in the liberal arts with day, evening, online and accelerated courses. The main campus is located in Kaimuki at 3140 Waialae Ave., Honolulu, HI 96816, with 10 satellite locations around Oahu military bases and Catholic parishes and schools. </p>

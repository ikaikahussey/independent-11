<p>Governor Abercrombie has appointed three new members to the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) today, who will serve as interim members until confirmed by the state Senate. Two of the vacancies were unexpected and resulted from the <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/state-agency-board-members-resign-en-mass">resignations</a> of Reed Kishinami and Wesley Furtado. The third vacancy is a result of a natural term expiration. </p>

<p>“Because of several recent resignations, these appointments were expedited to ensure that the land board would have sufficient members to conduct business without interruption to its meeting schedule,” Governor Abercrombie said.</p>

<p>The three nominations include Vernon Char, Ulalia Woodside and Christopher Yuen. Char was appointed to an at-large seat; Woodside to the seat representing the City and County of Honolulu and a BLNR requirement of having experience with Native Hawaiian cultural practices; and Yuen to an at-large seat and a BLNR requirement of having experience in conservation.</p>

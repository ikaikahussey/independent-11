<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Ruby Tuesday casual dining franchise is expanding big in Hawaii. RT Hawaii Restaurants, Inc. plans to open three new Ruby Tuesday restaurants within the next three years, with the first restaurant slated to open in June 2011. The locations have not yet been determined.</p>

<p>Principal investors Ted Davenport and Rick Nakashima currently own and operate Ruby Tuesday restaurants in Honolulu, Mililani, and Kaneohe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to the outpouring of support from the local communities, military, and tourists, we have enjoyed great success in the state of Hawaii,&#8221; said Davenport in a statement. &#8220;Ruby Tuesday is a proven concept and we&#8217;re confident these additional restaurants will be as successful as the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruby Tuesday&#8217;s menu offers a fresh garden bar, premium seafood entrees, including lobster, and quesadillas, as well as classic favorites like Ruby Minis, handcrafted burgers and ribs. In 2005, the company began a reimaging initiative that included a focus on food and service and concluded with the creation of a fresh new look for its restaurants.</p>

<p>In the 2011 fiscal year, Ruby Tuesday franchisees expect to open eight to 13 restaurants, up to 10 of which will be international.</p>

<p>Ruby Tuesday, Inc. has company-owned and/or franchise Ruby Tuesday brand restaurants in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and 14 foreign countries.</p>

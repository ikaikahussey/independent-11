<p>HAWAII KAI&#8212;Three schools will serve as off-site parking locations for the third annual Independence Day at Maunalua Bay on July 4: Kaiser High, Koko Head Elementary, and Hahaione Elementary. Free shuttles will be provided and there will be no parking at the event site itself. Sponsored by the non-profit Independence Day at Maunalua Bay Foundation, the festivities start at 1:00 p.m. and features continuous free entertainment, culminating in fireworks at 8:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Free shuttles donated by Kingâ€™s Cathedral of Niu Valley will provide transportation from the school parking areas to the event at Maunalua Bay Beach Park. The buses will run from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Each shuttle will be dedicated to one school site. </p>

<p>The parking locations are Kaiser High School next to fire station on Lunalilo Home Road, Koko Head Elementary on Lunalilo Home Road at Kalanianaole Highway, and Hahaione School, 595 Pepeekeo St. There will be no parking at the event site.</p>

<p>The festivities will feature continuous free entertainment headlined by Maunalua. The fireworks show presented by Grand Finale will take place at 8:00 p.m. from a barge in the bay. To help protect the bay, no personal fireworks will be allowed at the event. </p>

<p>Artist Patrick Ching of Naturally Hawaiian in Waimanalo will kick off activities at 1:00 p.m. with a patriotic art project where keiki will be able to help him paint his horse statue. The first 30 children to show up for painting will get a kokua treat.</p>

<p>Various businesses and schools will offer food and community and non-profit groups will have information booths, many with activities or games for keiki. In addition, Honolulu Police will set up keiki ID and there will be mini golf and canoe rides provided by Hui Nalu.</p>

<p>Independence Day at Maunalua Bay is an all-volunteer effort dedicated to celebrating friends, family, and freedom. Helping with the $65,000 cost are financial donors, including Quality Construction, Pacific International Realty and BluWater Grill, $5,000 Platinum sponsors. Other sponsors are Outback Steakhouse Hawaii Kai, 76 gas station at Koko Marina, Koko Marina Center, Hawaii Kai Chamber of Commerce, Hawaii Kai Marina Association, Hawaii American Water, Rotary Club of Hawaii Kai, Brett Hill Construction, Coastal Construction, East Oahu Realty and Buck Ohana. </p>

U.S. Sen. Brian <b>Schatz&#8217;s</b> advisers have prepared a campaign status memo for potential donors that depicts U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa&#8217;s campaign as &#8220;badly foundering&#8221; and not up to the rigors of a U.S. Senate race. The memo argues that Schatz has built a winning campaign that leads Hanabusa in fundraising and endorsements. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131017_Schatzs_campaign_is_a_winner_candidate_tells_wouldbe_donors.html?id=228138391" target="_blank">Star-Advertiser.</a><br><br />

Officials claim that <b>HawaiiHealthConnector.com</b>, the online Obamacare exchange designed to provide individuals and small businesses with information about health care plans, federal subsidies and tax credits, is now fully operational. But that wasn&#8217;t the case yesterday for some who tried to log on.

The Aloha State ranks near the bottom when it comes to providing <b>access to records</b> at a reasonable cost, according to a 2012 report from the Center for Public Integrity that measured government transparency and accountability throughout the U.S. Hawaii’s poor score is in large part because of the fees associated with searching for records and reviewing them for information officials believe should be withheld. <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/10/17/20124-hawaiis-public-records-what-can-hawaii-learn-from-other-states/" target="_blank">Civil Beat.</a><br><br />

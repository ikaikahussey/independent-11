<p>The Hawaii House on Wednesday night moved forward a bill to legalize gay marriage to the chamber’s final vote after a nearly 11-hour hearing that featured political maneuvering and chanting crowds outside the gallery. In a roll call vote, House lawmakers voted 30-18 to move forward the bill for a final reading, with three members excused. The bill will go to a last vote on Friday. <a href="http://westhawaiitoday.com/sections/news/state-wire/state-house-moves-gay-marriage-bill-forward.html">Associated Press.</a></p>

<p>The state House voted late Wednesday to move forward with a marriage equality bill after a day of drama and emotion where lawmakers plowed through numerous procedural motions and amendments that would have postponed action or significantly amended the bill to expand a religious exemption. The 30-18 decision sets up a final House vote on Friday to fulfill a 48-hour notice requirement. If the House approves the bill, it would return to the Senate for another review next week. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131107__OPPOSITION_FAILS.html?id=230948641">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

From there, the bill returns to the Senate for its consideration. <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/11/06/20347-gay-marriage-bill-clears-another-hurdle-final-house-vote-set-for-friday/">Civil Beat.</a></p>

<p>Gov. Neil Abercrombie, weaving marriage equality into Hawaii&#8217;s definition of aloha and religious liberty into the nation&#8217;s rich tradition of freedom, signed a bill into law on Wednesday granting gay and lesbian couples in the islands the right to marry. In an emotional celebration at the Hawai‘i Convention Center&#8217;s Liliu Theater, the Democratic governor made Hawaii the 15th state plus the District of Columbia to approve gay marriage. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131114__Governor_signs__landmark_law_.html?id=231863371">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>The alleged theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a Leeward Oahu homeless shelter has triggered an investigation by the state Department of Human Services.

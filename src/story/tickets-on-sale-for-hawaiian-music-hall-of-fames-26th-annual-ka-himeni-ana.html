<p>Tickets are on sale now for the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame’s 26th annual &#8220;Ka Himeni Ana.&#8221; The competition and concert is being held at the Hawaii Theatre on Friday, September 10 at 7:00 p.m.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ka Himeni Ana&#8221; features local groups performing the soft voice music style of nahenahe. With no microphones or amplified instruments and sung completely in the Hawaiian language, audiences will travel back in time to an earlier Hawaii Nei. Groups such as Hookena (which entered as Kipona Leo Hawaii), Kanilau, Alea, among many others have launched successful careers after winning this competition.</p>

<p>Contestants are judged on their musicality, including pitch, harmony, projection, and other aspects of performance. Their song selections composed by the performers themselves or created prior to 1945 will be sung in the Hawaiian language and in the nahenahe style.</p>

<p><i>Balcony seats are available for $20 and orchestra/loge seating is $30. Tickets can be purchased at the Hawaii Theatre Box Office, charge by phone at (808) 528-0506, or online at<a href="http://www.hawaiitheatre.com" title=" www.hawaiitheatre.com"> www.hawaiitheatre.com</a>.

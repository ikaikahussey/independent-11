In the same fanatic plane that cryptic games like the classic crossword puzzle or Sudoku bring to people across nations, cultures and demographics comes the latest entry from Hawai'i based publisher Tinfish Press.    The non-profit, founded by University of Hawai'i professor Susan Schultz, has been an outlet for experimental poetry and bookmaking in the islands since 1995. All Tinfish books use recycled materials.    Its latest publication, Tinfish 18.5: The Book, brings the poetry and musings of local writers Kai Gaspar, Ryan Oishi, Tiare Picard, Sage Uilani Takehiro, and Jill Yamasawa together with artists Sally French, Issac Parker, Jason Teraoka, Allison Uttley, and Jenifer Wofford.    To kick off the launch, An Evening with Tinfish Press will feature an art exhibition and readings from the book's poets on Sunday, Oct. 26 from 5 to 8 p.m. Schultz, who worked as editor on the project, art director Gaye Chan, and project curator Lian Lederman will also be on hand to discuss the process.    Get your ball point pens out and be ready to think outside the box for this one.

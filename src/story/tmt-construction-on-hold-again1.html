<p>Statement on Mauna Kea from Governor’s Office</p>

<p>By Chief of Staff Mike McCartney<br /></p><blockquote><p>HONOLULU&#8212;Eleven adults were arrested by the Hawai‘i Division of Conservation and Resource Enforcement (DOCARE) Wednesday, during a protest to stop construction of the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) atop Mauna Kea.<br />
 <br />
The arrests are unfortunate, but the state’s number one priority is the safety of the people on Mauna Kea – from TMT workers to protestors who are exercising their first amendment rights to peaceably assemble and protest in a civil manner.<br />
 <br />
We are disappointed and concerned that large boulders were found in the roadway leading to the summit of Mauna Kea. This action is a serious and significant safety hazard and could put people at risk.<br />
 <br />
Because of this, we are making an assessment to determine how to proceed.<br />
 <br />
We will be working to clear the roadway tomorrow. Therefore, construction is on hold until further notice.</p>

<p>Hawaii will get to hear the impact of WikiLeaks and modern media first-hand from a man who on the forefront of sunshine in our governments.</p>

<p><a href="http://toddgitlin.net" target="_blank">Todd Gitlin</a> is a writer, sociologist, communications scholar, novelist, poet, and chair of the PhD program at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.</p>

<p>Gitlin has written several articles for national and international distribution on WikiLeaks. He is one of 19 members of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism who have cosigned a letter to President Barack Obama and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder opposing any prosecution based on Wikileaks&#8217; release of government information.</p>

<p>In a letter to Obama and Holder, the members said: &#8220;Any prosecution of WikiLeaks&#8217; staff for receiving, posessing, or publishing classified materials will set a dangerous precedent for reporters in any publication or medium, potentially chilling investigative journalism and other First Amendment-protected activity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The presentation by Gitlin will also feature a Hawaii sunshine report on the State&#8217;s record of open government, transparency, and freedom of information. Media Council Hawaii will also announce its Fletcher Knebel award to a journalist for best use of freedom of information and open record laws in reporting. </p>

<p>The event is free to the public. For those wishing lunch, there will be a $15 charge, and reservations are necessary. Parking is in the structure accessible from Dole Street.</p>

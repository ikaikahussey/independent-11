<p>Barter Bar relaunches tonight, Fresh Café’s new Third Thursday monthly event, from 7 to 10 p.m.</p>

<p>Bartering, a universal idea understood by most, has been around from the dawn of time. Fast forward a few thousand years, repackage the concept, give it a name like Barter Bar, and one is treated to an innovative event where goods and services are exchanged and money is obsolete. The possibilities are endless. </p>

<p>“Barter Bar offers a real life CraigsList-like shopping experience, minus the money and the endless e-mails,” said <a href="http://freshcafehi.com/home/">Fresh Café</a> owner and long-time Kaka‘ako fixture Tiffany Tanaka, who co-produces the event with Matt Lynch, Dayna Kalakau, and Kaleo Ten. </p>

<p>The all-ages event will be themed differently each month and operates quite simply.</p>

<p>Guests come to Barter Bar with goods or services to trade. After introductions accompanied by some light conversation, refreshments, and perusing, the trading bell is rung and negotiations begin.</p>

<p>With no obligations and no pressure to make a trade, guests either leave satisfied with their trade, having not spent a dime, or they go home having networked with other like-minded professionals. Either way, there’s “no harm, no foul” as the old adage says.</p>

<p>June’s Barter Bar is themed around the design industries, including (but certainly not limited to) Web, graphic, fashion, and interior design. Justin Takaha White, a local graphic designer with a background in photography and illustration, will be Barter Bar’s featured business leader and will have the distinguished honor of ringing the trading bell at 8 p.m. to begin the evening’s trades. </p>

<p>White’s design prowess was integral in Barter Bar’s rebranding and collateral development, making him an obvious choice as the featured speaker for the night’s kick-off event. Future Barter Bar events will follow suit by featuring a business leader or organization consistent with the night’s theme. </p>

<p><em>From Radio New Zealand International:</em></p>

<p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (Radio New Zealand International, June 11, 2014) â€“ Kiribati President Anote Tong says it is already too late to save many small island states from being swamped by rising seas.</p>

<p>Mr Tong, speaking to CNN during negotiations in Bonn on a new climate change treaty, says total annihilation is now inevitable for Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives.</p>

<p>He says whatever is agreed today with the United States or China it will not have a bearing on Kiribati&#8217;s future, because it is too late.</p>

<p>But Mr Tong says he hopes it could provide a lesson that stronger action is needed on climate change.</p>

<p>He says hopefully that experience will send a very strong message that Kiribati might be on the front line today, but others will be on the front line next - and the next and the next.</p>

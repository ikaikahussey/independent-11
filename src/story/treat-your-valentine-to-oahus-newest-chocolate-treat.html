<p>MANOA&#8212;Madre Chocolate is a sweet collaboration between Nat Bletter, an ethnobotanist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and David Elliott, an expert in rural development and environmental justice issues. The socially conscious company, whose name translates to “mother chocolate,” makes artisanal chocolates in small batches right here in town, from organic bean growers in Mexico and Hawaii who pay fair wages to growers.</p>

<p>Madre processes their cacao beans lightly, to keep the antioxidant levels high so you can feel virtuous about indulging. Using ancient spices traditional to the Aztec, Maya, Olmec, and Barra tribes of Central America, the beautifully crafted bars come in such exciting flavors as Xocoxochitl (smoky-spicy chipotles and earthy allspice) and Candied Hibiscus.</p>

<p><i>Madre Chocolate is available at: Mercado de la Raza, 1315 Beretania St.; Kokua Market, 2648 S. King St.; and Sweet Paradise Chocolatier, 20-A Kainehe St. in Kailua. For more information, check out their <a href="http://madrechocolate.com/Madre_Chocolate/Home.html">website</a>.</i></p>

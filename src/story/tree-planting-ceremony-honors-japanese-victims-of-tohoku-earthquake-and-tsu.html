<p>A Japanese pine tree (matsu) planting ceremony will be held on Saturday, August 6 at 10:00 a.m. at the Japanese garden of Kepaniwai Park in Iao Valley in honor of the victims of the March 11 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.</p>

<p>As Honorary Chair of The Aloha Initiative, Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa is scheduled to convey his message of condolence and words of sympathy for the victims of the March 11 catastrophe.</p>

<p>Scheduled to be in attendance are the citizens of Japan who are on Maui through The Aloha Initiative, a Maui-led program initiated the week after the March 11 disaster to provide citizens of Japan who have been displaced by the recent earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear crisis with a warm and welcome home.</p>

<p>Organizers decided to plant a matsu because it is a symbol of long life and perseverance&#8212;legend holds that only one tree was left standing from a forest of trees in Rikuzen-Takata, Iwate Prefecture, following the terrifying force of the March 11 tsunami. </p>

<p>According to news reports, the Takata Matsubara forest was designated a scenic spot and a popular tourist destination in Iwate Prefecture. Approximately 70,000 red and black pines grew on an approximately 2-km-long stretch of beach.</p>

<p>The only tree, estimated to be from 270 to 280 years old, survived the tsunami. It was been a great emotional support to residents who have dubbed the tree, &#8220;kiseki no ippon matsu&#8221; (the miraculous lone pine tree).</p>

<p>The event is free and open to the public.</p>

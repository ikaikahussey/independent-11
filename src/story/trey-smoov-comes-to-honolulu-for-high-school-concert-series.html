<p>The three southern Californians comprise Trey Smoov (Mack Daddy, YC, and Vocalz) posted a YouTube video, simply tagged “Samoans Singing,” which quickly got attention. The members hoped to shatter the misconception that &#8220;Samoans are only good at sports.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Trey Smoov recently finished a major West Coast six-city tour with their cousin band Nesian NINE, playing shows in Las Vegas, Washington, Portland, San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles. Grassroots support from fans have led to a higher demand for shows all over the Pacific Rim and the continental United States.</p>

<p>Their next album, <i>The Smoov Island sounds of Trey Smoov</i> embraces their island roots and will be released in August with the single “Rude Boy.”</p>

<p>Through the high school concert series on May 12 and 13, Trey Smoov hopes to positively impact the lives of the students and share their stories of success and hope.&nbsp; </p>

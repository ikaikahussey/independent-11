<p>Our islands were fortunate to avert major tsunami damage Saturday night, following a 7.7 earthquake off the coast of British Columbia, Canada.</p>

<p>The warning was reduced to an advisory at 1 a.m. Sunday morning, and an all-clear was sounded at 4 a.m.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br />
BIg Island beaches have been reopened. Hanauma Bay on Oahu remains closed, and Hawaii Tourism Authority director Mike McCartney is quoted by the Star-Advertiser as recommending that visitors stay out of the beaches today.</p>

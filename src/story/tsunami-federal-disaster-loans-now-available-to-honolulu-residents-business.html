<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) announced on Tuesday, April 26 that low-interest federal disaster loans are now available to residents and business owners in Honolulu who suffered damages caused by the March 11 Honshu Tsunami.</p>

<p>SBA amended its March 29 declaration following additional damage assessments and following Gov. Neil Abercrombie’s April 21 request. The amended declaration now covers the counties of Hawaii, Honolulu, Kalawao, and Maui. </p>

<p>“Low-interest federal disaster loans are available to homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes and private, non-profit organizations whose property was damaged or destroyed by the tsunami,” said SBA&#8217;s Hawaii District Director Jane Sawyer.</p>

<p>Beginning Tuesday, April 26 at 1:00 p.m., customer service representatives will be on hand at the Honolulu SBA Disaster Loan Outreach Center to issue loan applications, answer questions about SBA’s disaster loan program, explain the application process, help each individual complete their application, and close their approved loans.&nbsp; The center will be open on the days and times indicated below. No appointment is necessary.</p>

<p>Businesses of any size and private, non-profit organizations may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory, and other business assets. SBA can also lend additional funds to homeowners and businesses to help with the cost of making improvements that protect, prevent, or minimize the same type of disaster damage from occurring in the future.</p>

<p>For small businesses and most private, non-profit organizations of any size, SBA offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) to help meet working capital needs caused by the disaster. EIDL assistance is available regardless of whether the business suffered any property damage. </p>

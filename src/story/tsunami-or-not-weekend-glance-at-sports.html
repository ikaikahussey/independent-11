<p>With Hawaii put under a tsunami warning and windy weather conditions outside, I was confined to staying indoors this weekend, watching the close of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, not surfing, and playing volleyball with old college teammates to wrap-up the weekend. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s time for March Madness as the NCAA college hoops tournament approaches. This marks the end of the spectating season for the Manoa Maniacs and long-time University of Hawaii basketball fans who attend almost every home game (at least there&#8217;s baseball season to look forward to). Five seniors and the rest of the Rainbow Warriors basketball team played their last game under the Stan Sheriff Arena lights for the 2010 season. UH took the court on Saturday and were able to snap the team&#8217;s nine-game losing streak, upsetting the Wolf Pack of Nevada, 74-63. The team, with an overall record of 10-18, will finish their regular season on the road this week before the WAC tournament. The Warriors will need to win the last two games to get a bid to the WAC tournament.</p>

<p>Looking toward the next generation of Hawaii&#8217;s basketball talent, Moanalua High School won their first OIA title in twenty-years Thursday night against east rival Kahuku, 55-48 at McKinley High School. The Menehune came into the championship game undefeated throughout the double elimination game. </p>

<p>After 17 days of cold weather that was filled with heart-warming (or tear-jerking) victories and defeats, the Winter Olympics has finally come to a fitting end. Canada played host to the 2010 events and showed the world why they are the home of hockey. Last week, the Canada women&#8217;s team upset the United States 2-1 taking the gold. On Sunday, Canada&#8217;s men&#8217;s team found themselves in the same position against Team USA for the gold. As I watched an entire hockey game for the first time, while flipping back and forth to other channels, Canada upset the United States, 3-2 in a thrilling overtime game after Team USA came back from a 2-0 deficit. The United States finished the Olympics with a total of 37 medals, but Canada had something to show for with the most gold medals at 14. </p>

<p>Things to look forward to this weekend include the number-seven ranked UH men&#8217;s volleyball team taking on number-four ranked BYU on Monday as they look for another big upset. The Warriors beat the Cougars this past weekend in a five-set, three-hour long match. <a href="http://www.hawaiiathletics.com" title="UH baseball">UH baseball</a> will take on Citadel University this week. <a href="http://www.sportshigh.com" title="The Hawaiian Airlines Hawaii Boys State Basketball Tournament ">The Hawaiian Airlines Hawaii Boys State Basketball Tournament </a>begins on March 3-6. The <a href="http://www.hasasurf.org" title="HSA surf contest">HSA surf contest</a> is set for this upcoming weekend at Nanakuli Tracks after being postponed this past weekend. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Don&#8217;t forget to go for a run, swim, hike, play a pick-up game or just get out of your office, if you have one. Enjoy Hawaii and being healthy!</p>

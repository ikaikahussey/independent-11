<p>About 45 minutes to go. Word spreading around the tsunami party is that it hit Tahiti, supposedly four meters high. Another alarm just went off and there are a lot of sail boats on the ocean out here. According to fellow tsunami pool party goers, there was a line out into the parking lot at Foodland this morning. Lifeguards reported two surfers in the water, not sure what spot though. We will see&#8230;</p>

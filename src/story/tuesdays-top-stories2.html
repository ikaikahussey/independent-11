<p>Army officials from China and the United States are meeting in Hawaii for an annual disaster relief exercise that will include field training for the first time this year. Specifics of the exercise scenario starting Tuesday have not been publicly released. U.S. Army Pacific officials have only described it as a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operation requiring U.S. and China military cooperation in a fictional third country.&nbsp; <a href="http://westhawaiitoday.com/sections/news/state-wire/china-us-begin-joint-disaster-exercise.html">Associated Press.</a></p>

<p>Chinese troops are taking part in disaster relief exercises in Hawaii today, in what China&#8217;s state media billed as the first time the country&#8217;s soldiers have drilled on U.S. territory. People&#8217;s Liberation Army soldiers are taking part in humanitarian assistance drills in Hawaii until Thursday with their U.S. counterparts, simulating relief operations after an earthquake hits a third country. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20131111_Chinese_soldiers_to_train_Tuesday_with_US_troops_in_Hawaii.html?id=231457741">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>The state Senate is poised to approve a same-sex marriage bill today and send it Gov. Neil Abercrombie for approval, setting up Hawaii to become the 15th state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry. Abercrombie is expected to sign the measure into law soon after, and the state Department of Health says it is ready to implement the law by its Dec. 2 effective date. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131112_Senate_forecast_to_approve_governor_to_sign_gay_marriage_bill_today.html?id=231532111">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>The jubilation is expected to continue for same sex marriage supporters. The Senate already voted 20 to 4 backing the bill and the amendments aren&#8217;t expected to change any minds in Tuesday&#8217;s final vote. Then it goes to the Governor for final approval. <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/23939272/marriage-equality-bill-could-be-signed-by-wednesday">Hawaii News Now.</a></p>

<p>Civil union versus marriage. Some wonder what&#8217;s the difference? Supporters of gay marriage say the rights and benefits. There are more than 1,000 federal benefits for same-sex couples, if they&#8217;re allowed to marry. And it&#8217;s not just federal tax benefits. <a href="http://www.khon2.com/news/same-sex-marriage-benefits-still-unclear">KHON2.</a></p>

<p>In the past three years, the total number of homeless residents in Hawaii seeking help from publicly funded services has dropped slightly, indicating modest gains in the effort to curb homelessness across the state, a report released today shows. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131112__homeless_problem_not_worsening.html?id=231532121">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>Hawaii candidates for federal office love to play up their local support. But a <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/11/12/20372-mainland-contributors-are-filling-tulsi-gabbards-campaign-coffers/">Civil Beat</a> analysis of U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard&#8217;s most recent campaign filing shows a candidate who has been traveling a lot and raising money throughout the country. The filing, covering July 15 through Oct. 15, with the Federal Election Commission shows that Gabbard had three times as many donors on the mainland — 146 total — as compared with Hawaii.</p>

<p>Severe assaults on employees at the state&#8217;s only public mental hospital have resulted in some of them being out of work for months and even years, a <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/23938597/exclusive-patient-attacks-leave-state-hospital-employees-out-of-work-for-months-years">Hawaii News Now</a> investigation revealed.

<p>Oahu</p>

<p>Hawaiian Electric Co. is hoping to fast-track nine solar farms on Oahu that could mean hundreds of thousands of solar panels stretching across areas equivalent to 40 Ala Moana Shopping Centers. The power is expected to lower consumer electricity bills, in addition to moving Hawaii away from its dependency on oil-fired generators. But where will all of these solar panels go? HECO won’t say. <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/11/12/20374-solar-farm-surprise-heco-wont-say-where-its-putting-new-huge-energy-projects/">Civil Beat.</a></p>

<p>Kauai</p>

<p>As Philippines President Benigno Aquino III declared State of National Calamity Monday in the aftermath of super typhoon Haiyan, Kauai residents had already been at work trying to raise relief funds for those affected. <a href="http://thegardenisland.com/news/local/rallying-to-help/article_1ddccd4a-4b63-11e3-8e9e-001a4bcf887a.html">Garden Island.</a></p>

<p>About 10 percent of Kauai’s population, said Capt. Bruce Hay, is composed of former and current soldiers. “That’s a pretty impressive statistic that no other town of equal size, that I am aware of, has,” said the commanding officer of the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Mana. “So Kauai, in particular, answers the call of service and continues to do so.” <a href="http://thegardenisland.com/news/local/answering-the-call/article_7814f0a2-4b64-11e3-b59a-001a4bcf887a.html">Garden Island.</a></p>

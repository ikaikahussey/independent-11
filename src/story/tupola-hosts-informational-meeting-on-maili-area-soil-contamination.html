<p>State Representative Andria Tupola will host an informational briefing regarding contamination in Maʻili with guest presenters from the Department of Health and the U.S. Coast Guard on April 9, from 7:00 to 8:30 p.m. </p>

<p>In October 2015, news stations shared details regarding the chemical pollution in a portion of the 93 acre lot partly owned by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) and the U.S. Coast Guard. The meeting will take place at the Kamehameha Schools Learning center which is on the southwest corner of the 93 acre lot. From 1953 to 1970, a portion of the 93 acre lot had electrical transformers on a concrete slab which left toxic chemicals (PCB’s) found in dangerous quantities contaminating the soil of the surrounding area. The alarming levels of these chemicals pose a risk to residents.<br />

<br />
The Coast Guard has received the funding necessary to clean the contaminated area and the Department of Health is working together with the Coast Guard to organize an appropriate clean up effort. Both agencies will be sharing with the community their action steps, their timeline, and will be answering questions. A representative from DHHL will be present in the event that community members have questions regarding the DHHL portion of the aforementioned parcel.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Crews from the City and County of Honolulu&#8217;s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) responded to two more sanitary sewer overflows today&#8212;one in Waipahu and the other in Downtown.</p>

<p>ENV took the Waipahu call at 11:45 a.m., arrived at 12:30 p.m,. and secured the site at 12:45 p.m.</p>

<p>While cleaning a sewer pipe near 94-230 Kahulio Place in Waipahu, a third party contractor experienced equipment trouble causing a 6,000-gallon wastewater spill.&nbsp; A Vactor truck was able to recover 2,000 gallons, while 4,000 gallons entered a waterway that leads to Middle Loch.</p>

<p>The Downtown call came in at 12:25 p.m., ENV arrived at 12:35 p.m. and secured the site at 12:50 p.m.</p>

<p>Grease clogged a 10-inch terra cotta pipe releasing 2,500 gallons of untreated wastewater out a manhole on Alapai Street between South King and South Beretania streets. A Vactor truck was able to recover 60 gallons with 2,440 making its way into a storm drain leading to Honolulu Harbor.</p>

<p>ENV notified the state Department of Health of both incidents. The affected areas were cleaned, disinfected and deodorized. The posting of warning signs and water sampling are underway.</p>

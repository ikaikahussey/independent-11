<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.&#8212;Congress moved ahead legislation that extends by three months the required closing date for a federal homebuyer tax credit for homes purchased through April 30, 2010. The Homebuyers Assistance and Improvement Act, H.R. 5623, aims to provide taxpayers who purchased a home by April 30 a closing deadline of October 1, 2010. Under current law, closings must occur by June 30.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/vote/2010/h/401" title="The U.S. House passed">The U.S. House passed</a> the legislation by an overwhelming majority vote of 409 yeas to 5 nays&#8212;including supporting votes from both Rep. Mazie Hirono (D, HI) and Rep. Charles Djou (R, HI). </p>

<p>According to the National Association of Realtors, the closing of an estimated 710 home sales in the State of Hawaii will be delayed beyond the June 30 deadline.</p>

<p>H.R. 5623 extends the tax credit of up to $8,000 for qualified first-time home buyers, as well as a credit of up to $6,500 for repeat buyers purchasing a principal residence. If the bill is not signed into law, some 180,000 homebuyers across the country will lose their tax credit. </p>

<p>The Homebuyers Assistance and Improvement Act now goes before the U.S. Senate for consideration.</p>

<p>The Senate Appropriations Committee lopped $8.1 billion off the 2011 Defense budget on Thursday, mainly by cutting two top-priority Air Force and Navy weapons programs, and trimming dozens of smaller programs, <a href="http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20100916/DEPARTMENTS01/9160303/" title="Federal Times reports.">Federal Times reports.</a></p>

<p>Sen. Daniel Inouye, Appropriations Committee chairman, called the cuts &#8220;tough measures.&#8221; But he said, &#8220;We believe in total the package is not only fair, but presents a carefully balanced set of recommendations&#8221; that meet security needs for 2011. Inouye had previously been pushing for big spending in military projects.</p>

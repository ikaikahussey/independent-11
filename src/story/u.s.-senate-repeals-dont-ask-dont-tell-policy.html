<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Over 13,000 military troops have been discharged since the &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; policy was introduced in 1993. This Saturday morning on Capitol Hill, the U.S. Senate voted in support of the &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.&#8221; With the enactment of <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR2965:" title="H.R. 2695">H.R. 2695</a>, the current Department of Defense (DOD) policy, which discharged troops for findings of open homosexuality, has been repealed.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s U.S. Senate vote included 63 yeas, 33 nays, and 4 not voting. Hawaii Senators Daniel Akaka (D) and Daniel Inouye (D) voted in favor of the repeal. The U.S. House vote on the repeal of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; was 241 yeas to 179 nays on December 15. Hawaii Congressman Charles Djou (R) voted against the measure, while Hawaii Congresswoman Mazie Hirono (D) voted in favor of the repeal.</p>

<p>After President Barack Obama signs the act into law, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; will officially be overturned 60 days after the DOD completes a comprehensive review on the implementation of the repeal, and the president, secretary, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) certify the proposed plan of action to move forward with the repeal. Under H.R. 2695, that plan must be &#8220;consistent with the standards of military readiness and effectiveness, unit cohesion, and military recruiting and retention.&#8221;</p>

<p>Social conservatives have been largely out of the latest fight on repeal of the ban, <i><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2010/1218/In-historic-vote-Senate-moves-to-end-don-t-ask-don-t-tell" title="The Christian Science Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a></i> reported. “The conservative groups are not here because they’re going to lose,” said David Smith, vice president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay and lesbian civil rights group. “Public attitudes have shifted. There are people on the front lines in combat who know gay and lesbians in the ranks. Eighty percent say there’s no problem.”</p>

<div class="pull-gold">&#8220;It is time to allow gay and lesbian Americans to serve their country openly.&#8221;</div>

<p>President Barack Obama issued the following statement on the repeal of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;Today, the Senate has taken an historic step toward ending a policy that undermines our national security while violating the very ideals that our brave men and women in uniform risk their lives to defend. By ending “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” no longer will our nation be denied the service of thousands of patriotic Americans forced to leave the military, despite years of exemplary performance, because they happen to be gay. And no longer will many thousands more be asked to live a lie in order to serve the country they love.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Commander-in-Chief, I am also absolutely convinced that making this change will only underscore the professionalism of our troops as the best led and best trained fighting force the world has ever known. And I join the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the overwhelming majority of service members asked by the Pentagon, in knowing that we can responsibly transition to a new policy while ensuring our military strength and readiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to thank Majority Leader Reid, Senators Lieberman and Collins and the countless others who have worked so hard to get this done. It is time to close this chapter in our history. It is time to recognize that sacrifice, valor and integrity are no more defined by sexual orientation than they are by race or gender, religion, or creed. It is time to allow gay and lesbian Americans to serve their country openly. I urge the Senate to send this bill to my desk so that I can sign it into law.&#8221;</p>

<p>What does this mean in Hawaii?</p>

<p>For the 2010 election, the County of Hawaii was given the authority by the Legislature to conduct a pilot program using matching or equalizing funds for the Hawaii County Council races. The bill, HB661 became law as <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2008/bills/GM932_.pdf" title="Act 244">Act 244</a> without the Governor&#8217;s signature. It established the pilot program for Hawaii County only, and for three election cycles starting with the 2010 election.<br />

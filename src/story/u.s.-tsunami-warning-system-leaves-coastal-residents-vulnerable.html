<p>A study finds that the United States must do more to prepare for tsunamis and that it is critical of coordination between the two federal Tsunami Warning Centers in Alaska and Hawaii, and their communication with emergency managers, the media, and the public, <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/sep2010/2010-09-17-02.html" title="according to Environmental News Service.">according to Environmental News Service.</a></p>

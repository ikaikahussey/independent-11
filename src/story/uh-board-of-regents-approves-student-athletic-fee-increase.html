<p>MANOA&#8212;The University of Hawai‘i Board of Regents today approved a UH M?noa student athletic fee of $50 that will go into effect in Spring (January) 2011, despite <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/uh-graduate-students-still-say-no-to-50-fee-increase/" title="opposition by campus' governing student bodies.">opposition by campus&#8217; governing student bodies.</a></p>

<p>Both the Associates Students of UH (ASUH) and the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) voted against a fee increase.</p>

<p>The projected $2 million raised annually by the fee will go to the Athletics Department for support of student-athletes, through scholarships, travel, materials and supplies, and other expenses&#8212;but not staff compensation or benefits.</p>

<p>The fee will also enable M?noa students to attend home athletic events simply by showing their ID cards&#8212;a first for the campus&#8212;while 5,000 seats of Aloha Stadium will be set aside for M?noa students for Warrior football games.</p>

<p>In addition, 5 to 8 percent of the revenues ($100,000-$160,000) will be set aside for student activities, as determined by a Student Athletic Fee Committee controlled by a student majority.</p>

<p>“Our next step is to determine details of the student benefit package through working with a new Student Athletic Fee Committee that is predominantly students and represent different student organizations,” said Manoa Chancellor Virginia S. Hinshaw.</p>

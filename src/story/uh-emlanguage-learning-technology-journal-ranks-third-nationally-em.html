<p>MANOA &#8212; <em>Language Learning &amp; Technology</em>, an online-refereed journal published by UH Mānoa’s National Foreign Language Resource Center, ranks third nationally among education journals, according to the latest Thomson Reuters Journal Citations Report.&nbsp; The same report also ranks the journal third in the linguistics category.</p>

<p>When grouped with journals in education and educational research, Language Learning &amp; Technology ranks number three out of 139 journals in impact in 2009, the last year for which the analysis is available. The journal, which is co-published by Michigan State University, reports research issues relating to technology and language education. </p>

<p>“These rankings put UH Mānoa in the company of the very best and most prestigious journals,” said Robert Bley-Vroman, dean of the College of Languages Linguistics and Literature. “UH Mānoa is a world leader, especially in research in second language teaching and learning. This is a real coup for Hawai‘i.”</p>

<p>Journal rankings are important for scholars in the field who use such guidelines to decide where to publish in order to build their careers. The rankings are also important to promotion and tenure committees, as well as scholars who use the rankings to help advise students on which journals to read.</p>

<p>MANOA&#8212;David Plotz, in his <i>Slate</i> article, &#8220;August: Let&#8217;s get rid of it,&#8221; brands the late summer month the &#8220;Mississippi of the calendar,&#8221; the &#8220;vast sandy wasteland of American culture,&#8221; and the &#8220;month of vagueness,&#8221; positing that August rates merely &#8220;three mentions in Bartlett&#8217;s Quotations, compared to a dozen for December and two dozen for March.&#8221; </p>

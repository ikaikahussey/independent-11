<p>MANOA &#8212; The University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa Online Learning Academy (OLA), which is in its third year of having UH Mānoa students provide free, live online math tutoring to Hawai‘i public school students, is currently piloting a program offering the same services to students attending UH Maui College, and Hawai‘i, Kaua‘i and Kapi‘olani community colleges. Beginning in Fall 2011, the program will be available to students at all UH community colleges throughout Hawai‘i.</p>

<p>Currently, all 32 OLA tutors are UH Mānoa students majoring in mathematics or sciences. They are available from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Friday in the program’s “online tutoring room,” which is virtual and does not exist in an actual building.&nbsp; Instead, </p>

<p>UH Mānoa tutors sign on from their own computers, wherever they are and when they are able to tutor.</p>

<p>There are currently two afterschool programs in which computer lab monitors are available to public school students who want to log onto OLA’s online tutoring room to get help from UH Mānoa tutors. One program is at Konawaena High and Middle School on the Big Island, and the other is at Kalama Intermediate on Maui. </p>

<p>OLA operates year-round and will continue through the summer for students taking summer school math classes.&nbsp; </p>

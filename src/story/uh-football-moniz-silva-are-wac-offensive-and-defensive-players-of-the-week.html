<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The University of Hawaii football team&#8217;s quarterback Bryant Moniz and safety Mana Silva were named the Western Athletic Conference offensive and defensive players of the week, respectively.</p>

<p>Moniz, a junior from Wahiawa, was 27-of-38 for 326 yards and three touchdowns in a 45-10 win over Idaho. He also rushed seven times for 43 yards and another score. After starting the game 1-of-7, he completed 26 of his next 31 passes and accounted for a touchdown in each of the four quarters.&nbsp; Moniz is the first quarterback in the nation to reach 3,000 yards this season (3,247) and leads the country in total offense with 373.4 yards per game.</p>

<p>Silva, a senior from Hilo, had nine tackles (6 solo), including one for a loss of 13 yards, and intercepted a pass in the win over Idaho. The interception occurred in the first quarter with the score tied, 3-3, and Idaho in Hawaii territory. The turnover led to a touchdown drive and a 10-3 lead for the Warriors. It was Silva&#8217;s 12th career interception, one shy of tying the school record.</p>

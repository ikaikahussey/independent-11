<p>MANOA&#8212;The University of Hawaii at Manoa’s Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs has initiated the formal search process for the regular appointment of two dean positions, one for the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) and the other for the College of Arts and Humanities (A&amp;H). Both Colleges are being led by interim deans.</p>

<p>“CTAHR is central to the University’s mission as the land-grant campus for the state,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Reed Dasenbrock. &#8220;The nature of the State’s agricultural economy is changing very rapidly, and the research, teaching, and outreach missions of CTAHR are essential to the state’s transition into a new model for agriculture in the state, which can play a role in food and energy sustainability.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
Dean William Chismar of Outreach College will chair the CTAHR 12-member Search Advisory Committee, and College of Languages, Linguistics and Literature Dean Robert Bley-Vroman will chair the A&amp;H 12-member Search Advisory Committee. Both committees will recommend finalists to Chancellor Virginia S. Hinshaw and Vice Chancellor Dasenbrock. The committees include chairs, faculty, staff, and students from each College, as well as representatives of the Kualii Council and UH Alumni Association.&nbsp;  </p>

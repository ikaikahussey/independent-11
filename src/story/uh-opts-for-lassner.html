<p>Earlier today, the University of Hawaiʻi Board of Regents (BOR) chose David Lassner to be the next president of the UH system, which is comprised of 10 statewide campuses. Lassner has served as interim president since September 2013 after M.R.C. Greenwood retired from the position.</p>

<p>Lassner has been at UH for almost 40 years, specializing in information technology. As such, he was seen as the &#8220;inside candidate,&#8221; as opposed to Lt. General Frank Wiercinski, the second finalist. Both candidates were heavily criticized by the larger UH community; Lassner because of his insider status, and <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/wiercinksis-way">Wiercinski</a> because of his military background and lack of academic experience.</p>

<p>There has also been a great deal of criticism of the BOR over their search process. Vocal critics such as State Senate President Donna Mercado Kim and the UH Graduate Student Organization called on the regents to re-open the search because of the regents&#8217; failure to find the 5–6 finalists they originally said they would look for.</p>

<p>The final regent vote count was 11 for Lassner, two for Wiercinski and two abstains.</p>

<p>Wiercinski released the following statement shortly after the regent vote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I would like to thank the Board of Regents for the honor and privilege of being a finalist for the critical position of University of Hawaii President.&nbsp; I also want to thank all the Chancellors and their teams, Vice Presidents, Faculty Senate Chairs, Student Caucus leadership, UHPA and HGEA leadership, UH Foundation, Alumni Association, and the BOR&#8217;s staff.&nbsp; I will always recall their passion and dedication, and their dignity and respect during our conversations.</p>

<p>I would like to particularly thank those who nominated me for this position, asked me to serve, and further acknowledge their support and confidence in my leadership abilities.&nbsp; I am in awe of their courage and efforts to move the University forward, and so very grateful for their unyielding support.</p>

<p>Jeannine and I wish to congratulate David Lassner as he assumes the permanent President&#8217;s position.&nbsp; We wish him and the University of Hawaii great success and Aloha.</p>

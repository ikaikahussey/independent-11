<p>MOILIILI&#8212;University of Hawaii&#8217;s Pacific New Media is holding a discussion entitled &#8220;Filmmaking from a Kanaka Maoli Point of View&#8221; on Friday, November 5 in the Yukiyoshi Room, Krauss Hall 012.</p>

<p>The screening of <i>Kekohi </i>will begin at 6:30 p.m. <i>Kekohi</i> (2008) is the story of the son of a warrior-king who is selected to be the royal court&#8217;s message runner during the early to mid-17th century. By <a href="http://joyboyfilms.com/about.html" title="Joyboy Productions">Joyboy Productions</a>, the film is 36 minutes long.</p>

<p>At 7:15 p.m. there will be a panel discussion of working Kanaka Maoli filmmakers featuring Tuti Baker, Kaniela Joy, Ed Joy, Naalehu Anthony, and Aina Paikai. They will delve into the topic of storytelling in Hawaiian culture, and how this translates to film. What responsibility do Kanaka Maoli filmmakers have to their language and culture, their ancestors and the land of their birth? Is there a Kanaka Maoli film aesthetic that is different from Hollywood?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Naalehu Anthony found his passion for telling stories through film as a crewmember documenting the voyaging canoe <i>Hokulea</i>. Since then, he has become a successful producer/director and cinematographer. He has worked on a wide range of projects both in Hawaii and around the Pacific. Anthony received an MBA from UH Manoa and owns Paliku Documentary Films. </p>

<p>Mary Tuti Baker is a Kanaka Maoli filmmaker and scholar. She is currently a PhD student in Political Science at UH Manoa, focusing on ways that indigenous people practice self-determination in their everyday lives.</p>

<p>Aina Paikai is a recent graduate from UH Manoa under the Academy for Creative Media. He has had films screened at the Hawaii International Film Festival, the Big Island Film Festival, the Oiwi Film Festival, and the Shanghai International Film Festival.</p>

<p>Kaniela Joy has worked in the film industry for over 16 years, both on and off screen. He has worked on set for <i>Kikaida, Pirates of the Caribbean,</i> and <i>Heavens Trail,</i> among others. He and his brother Ed Joy have also produced and starred in three of their own low budget films.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ed Joy has been involved in theater since high school. He has worked in the production crew for films including <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> and <i>Crowsfoot</i>. He has written various film scripts including <i>Divers, Hookipa</i>, and <i>Kekohi</i>. </p>

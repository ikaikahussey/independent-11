<p>MANOA&#8212;The University of Hawaii at Manoa&#8217;s School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene has launched construction of the UH Translational Health Science Simulation Center (UH THSSC). The new $7.5 million center will serve as a campus hub for interdisciplinary translational health science research, simulation, and research education. </p>

<p>The UH THSSC will be a state-of-the-art facility for clinical simulation for students, educators, practicing health-care providers, and researchers. <br />
 <br />
“With the strong commitment of the University and support from our health-care partners and the community, research-driven and evidence-based practice innovations will flow to practice settings to serve the people of Hawaii,” said Mary Boland, dean of the School of Nursing and Dental Hygiene.</p>

<p>Targeted for completion in Fall 2011, the entire 8,500-square-foot floor will be constructed with labs for family assessment, intensive care physiology, acute physiology, community technology, stress/biofeedback, exercise and telehealth, interdisciplinary group areas, interview data acquisition rooms, and offices.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Four University of Hawaii at Manoa students will be spending the Spring 2011 semester in Washington, D.C., as Fellows interning in all four offices of Hawaii’s Congressional delegation.</p>

<p>The students are:</p>

<p><b>Sun Young “Kelly” Park</b>, 21, of Hawaii Kai, who is serving in the office of U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono.

<p>“Crucial to the mission of UH Manoa is giving our students the opportunity for real-world experiences that will help prepare them for their future careers,” said Reed Dasenbrock, Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs.</p>

<p>Scholarship funding covers a full semester’s tuition and earns each intern 15 credits toward graduation. Also covered are the costs of air fare to and from Washington, D.C., paid dormitory housing, a food and winter clothing allowance, and a stipend for incidentals.</p>

<p>In addition to its Congressional Intern Program, UH Manoa will place 10 student interns in the 2011 session of the Hawaii State Legislature and a student intern in the Honolulu Department of the Prosecuting Attorney.</p>

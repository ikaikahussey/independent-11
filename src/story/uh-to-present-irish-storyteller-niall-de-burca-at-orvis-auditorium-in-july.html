<p>MANOA &#8212; The University of Hawaii will present world-renowned Irish storyteller Niall De Burca at Orvis Auditorium on Saturday, July 2. He was raised in Galway and displayed a talent for narrative from a young age. At home he has featured in theatre, radio and at many festivals including Féile Earraai, the CS Lewis Festival, and The National Children&#8217;s Book Festival. Abroad he has performed and held workshops in countries as diverse as Poland, Argentina, Italy and The Netherlands. </p>

<p>Niall also spent many years living in New Zealand. His experiences as an emigrant there have had a major influence on his work and performance style. </p>

<p>Recognized for the diversity of his stories and with an ability to  reach all ages, Niall is a familiar figure to many Irish children through his innovative school programmes. His “Storytelling As A Tool Of Education” workshops are highly recommended by educators. In  May 2002 he received a Medal Of Excellence from the Heidleberg  school district in Germany for his work with young authors.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Students completing an associate’s degree in Kapiolani Community College’s (KCC) information technology and marketing programs have a new pathway toward a bachelor’s degree at the University of Hawaii-West Oahu, thanks to new articulation agreements between the schools.</p>

<p>The new agreements take advantage of a prior agreement between the schools (M?nanawai Program, 2008) allowing for dual admission and dual enrollment of KCC students in good standing and who meet UH West Oahu’s admission criteria. Qualified IT and marketing students may transfer as classified students to UH West Oahu’s bachelor of applied science with a concentration in IT or bachelor of arts in business administration with a concentration in marketing programs, respectively.</p>

<p>“These new agreements between our schools are intended to help students further strengthen their educational foundation attained at KCC while taking advantage of our baccalaureate programs in IT and marketing,” said UH West Oahu Chancellor Gene Awakuni. “I am grateful that we have strong ties with other UH campuses interested in meeting the workforce needs of our state.”</p>

<p>The agreements ensure faculty and administration at both campuses assist students with counseling and other services to further their understanding of program requirements as well as scholarship and grant opportunities that may exist at the campuses. This coordination between the campuses is designed to ease students along a university baccalaureate program path.</p>

<p>These new agreements between KCC and UH West O‘ahu will be reviewed regularly by both campuses and can be altered or discontinued with the consent of both schools.</p>

<p>KCC&#8217;s information technology program is career-laddered and competency-based. It provides training in the use and support of business-related computer systems, data communication networks (including local area networks), World Wide Web and its importance to businesses, and the development of business information technology systems programs using procedural and object-oriented programming techniques. The Marketing program provides hands-on competency-based training for a career in the retail industry. A combination of retailing, advertising and promotion, customer service, sales management, supervisory management, merchandise management, and e-commerce courses provide focused hands-on training.</p>

<p>UH West O‘ahu’s IT and marketing programs provide students with skills to design, install, configure and maintain enterprise-wide networks. Marketing students learn to evaluate and develop advertising, public relations, and direct mail campaigns as well as examine the science of consumer behavior and business in the context of promotion and publicity. Marketing students will be exposed to an interdisciplinary business curriculum including finance, economics, information systems, accounting, and management.</p>

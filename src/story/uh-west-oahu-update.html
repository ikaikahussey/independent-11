<p>KAPOLEI&#8212;A month has passed since starting construction on the three-decade dream formerly known as West Oahu College. Now known as University of Hawaii West Oahu, the campus has school officials excited.</p>

<p>“Any of the feedback we have heard has all been very positive,” said Kelli Trifonivich, director of Community and Project Development for UH West Oahu. “They are all saying at last it&#8217;s come. They’ve been all wanting it for decades, and now it’s here.”</p>

<p>After breaking ground on August 16, phase one of the Kapolei campus is currently under construction, with mass grading of the ground taking place now. Building construction is scheduled to start in December. Doors are expected to open to students in August of 2012.</p>

<p>The first phase of the campus will consist of five buildings: a two-story classroom building, a two-story laboratory building, a library, a student center, and a maintenance building that will serve both the initial and future phases of West Oahu. </p>

<p>The total area of phase one will cover over 10 acres, or 95,000 square feet. </p>

<p>The campus is designed to be practical for education as well as environmentally sustainable. Almost all buildings will be constructed to abide by the standards of the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system. The campus&#8217; plans focus on the reduction of waste generation, traffic congestion, and pollution in water runoff. </p>

<p>One of the biggest features of the campus will be the “Great Lawn” that is designed to be located in the heart of the campus buildings. The 3.9 acres will be available for students to relax, socialize, eat, and do schoolwork. The lawn will also be the place where commencement ceremonies will take place. </p>

<p>According to West Oahu Chancellor Gene Awakumi, the initial enrollment goal for the university is 7,600 students. </p>

<p>“There are also plans for a 250-room dormitory to accommodate the students,&#8221; Trifonivich said. &#8220;These plans for the dorm rooms are not part of phase one but is still in the works to come shortly after.&#8221; </p>

<p>As construction moves forward, the focus for administration, faculty, and staff is getting students in the new classrooms.</p>

<p>“The real focus right now is making sure we open on time and well. We are concentrating right now on getting the word out to students and prospective students to enroll,” Trifonivich said. “Basically getting student enrollment higher, making sure construction is completed on time for the students, and developing and expanding our degree programs.”</p>

<p>Once the phase one construction is complete in about two years, the campus will be able to accommodate up to 3,7000 students. Phase two is expected to take five years to complete.</p>

<p>Despite the positive feedback described by the UH spokesperson, Trifonivich acknowledged that there are still people who think funding used for building UH West Oahu should instead be put into fixing the UH Manoa campus&#8217; infrastructure and into current academics and athletics.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Trifonivich said the UH West Oahu fills a void in the Leeward side.</p>

<p>“The Legislature saw the need for this campus,&#8221; Trifonivich said, &#8220;it didn’t come out of any other pockets including Manoa. They saw the need for it and the need to serve this region. It’s something certainly needed to give the students the easier access in earning a four-year degree close to home.”</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In the midst of a worsening physician shortage, the University of Hawaii&#8217;s John A. Burns School of Medicine presented on Friday its largest ever incoming class of medical students.</p>

<p>This year’s entering class is the first to be increased in years, despite cuts in state funding to the medical school. The decision to increase the class size to 64 (from 62) was announced earlier this year. The new class begins its studies next week.There are also four MD classes training at one time at the medical school, for an annual total of more than 250 medical students.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, data was presented at a physician workforce summit showing that Hawaii is at least 600 physicians short of the number who should be practicing here, based on the state’s population. The shortage could double or triple by 2020. Aggravating that situation, 25 percent of Hawaii’s current working physicians are at or near retirement age.</p>

<p>During the White Coat Ceremony on Friday, the members of the incoming class formally received the shorter-length white coats which identify them as medical students. They will also be led in a recitation of the physician’s creed, the Hippocratic Oath.</p>

<p>The following are some quick facts about the Class of 2014:<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; The 64 students are an elite group, selected from more than 1,600 people who applied this year.<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 90 percent of the incoming class are Hawaii residents.<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 85 percent of the class attended high school in Hawaii.<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Five are from Hawaii Island and one is from Kauai, two rural islands where the need for new physicians is greatest.<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Women make up 52 percent of the class.<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; The students range in age from 24 to 31, with 24 the average age.<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Eighteen of this year’s students received degrees from the University of Hawaii at M?noa, two attended UH-Hilo, and the others hold degrees from institutions that include Yale University, Columbia University, Boston University, and the University of California at Berkeley.<br />
·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; In addition to holding bachelor’s degrees in science or the arts, the incoming medical students include young men and women who earned advanced degrees in business, education, pharmacy, and public health.</p>

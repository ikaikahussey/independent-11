HILO&#8212;The “ukulele” is the most used instrument in modern Hawaiian music. For some time, the sounds of the ukulele have also been heard in everything from pop music to reggae. Last week, Hilo residents got to hear first hand the unique sounds of the ukulele in the form of jazz music.</p>

<p>On June 25, the historical Palace Theatre in downtown Hilo hosted ukulele musicians Benny Chong and Byron Yasui. The duo performed blends of traditional Hawaiian ukulele and jazz. Local band Ben Kaili and Friends opened the concert with wonderful acoustic sounds.</p>

<p>Before the concert, <i>Youth News for The Hawaii Independent</i> had a chance to talk story with Chong. A self-taught ukulele player, Chong grew up on Oahu with the goal of making music of his own. The main sources of inspiration were his uncles. Learning chord after chord, Chong conjured up his creativity from simplicity by taking songs like “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” and “Crazy G,” and adding his own flavor to it. Benny has been performing as a musician all his life, first off playing solo, then at the age of 18 forming a group called The Aliis. He eventually went on to perform with Jake Shimabukuro and Byron Yasui.</p>

<p>His experience and journey as a musician is still flying high, displaying incredible sounds on the ukulele. With knowledge of playing various types of music, Chong considers “contemporary music” his favorite genre.</p>

<p>Music is about expressing an individual’s thoughts or feelings and not about what others think, Chong explained to <i>Youth News</i>. “I can teach music, but I cannot teach creativity,“ Chong said.</p>

<p>When asked what advice he would give to young musicians, Chong said: “Don’t make music a full-time job ... only a small percentage of people will actually make it.” </p>

<p>Teaching, however, is an aspect of music that Chong loves. With already one album out titled “Ukulele Jazz,” he now wants to take on other projects such as creating books and videos about playing the ukulele.</p>

<p>Also included in the Ukulele jazz duo is Byron Yasui. He has a significant background in music. As a music professor since 1972 at University of Hawaii at Manoa, Yasui is skilled in music composition and theory, jazz double bass, guitar, as well as ukulele. During his time with the symphony, Yasui produced music as a composer and earned numerous awards as well as the opportunity for those works to be performed in prestigious theatres, such as Carnegie Hall. Yasui&#8217;s latest album <i>Anahola</i> features a number of island contemporary songs. </p>

<p>At last week&#8217;s concert on Palace Theatre&#8217;s center stage, Chong and Yasui performeda medley which included “The Mickey Mouse Club Theme Song” and “Somewhere Over The Rainbow,” giving the audience a chance to reminisce about their childhood. Among the many pieces they played on the ukulele, the most interesting was composed by the famous Tchaikovsky&#8212;“Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.” At the end of the night, the ukulele duo received a standing ovation.</p>

<p>The head of the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism says that in order for the state to reach its renewable energy goal, it needs an undersea <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/2013/09/hawaii-counting-on-lng-undersea-cable.html">cable</a> connecting Oahu, Maui and eventually the Big Islandâ€™s electric grid and that, as a transitional fuel, liquefied natural gas, or LNG, needs to be shipped in to the state.</p>

<p>The state Public Utilities Commission will allow seven community, environmental and industry groups as well as energy developers and government officials to have a greater say in whether <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/businesspremium/20130912__Groups_given_more_say_on_undersea_cable_issue.html?id=223417331">building</a> an undersea cable to connect the electrical grids of Oahu and Maui is in the public interest. Allowing the &#8220;intervenors&#8221; to participate in the commission&#8217;s investigation will give authorities better information about the potential costs and benefits of such a project, according to a PUC ruling issued Tuesday.</p>

<p>A rally is being held today at the State Capitol, organized by members of local labor unions in support of public sector union workers in the handful of Midwestern states now targeting union benefits as part of an effort to slash government spending.</p>

<p>The event was planned to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was murdered on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was speaking on behalf of sanitation workers trying to organize.&nbsp; Local 5 is expected to bus in 200 members and supporters for the rally at Hawaii&#8217;s capitol. Union and other civic leaders are scheduled to speak to the crowd.<br />

<p>A high-level University of Hawaii executive <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/10/04/20065-uh-exec-who-allegedly-lied-about-accounting-credential-still-on-job/">remains</a> in her job — at the same pay — following the conclusion of a university investigation into whether she misrepresented herself as a certified public accountant. University officials refuse to say why she’s still on the job or whether or not they concluded that she illegally misrepresented herself on her resume.</p>

<p>CHINATOWN &#8212; Venus Vibe Trap, a monthly musician showcase at <a href="http://www.bar35hawaii.com/" target="_blank">Bar 35</a> organized by Jason Tabosa, former percussionist for Spearhead’s Michael Franti, offers a fresh batch of Hawaii songwriters on Thursday, June 23, including Radha Divine, Amanda Frazier, Andrew Dames, and Intrepid. This will be the fourth installment of VVT, and judging by the success the event has enjoyed, there is much more to come.</p>

<p>“The word is definitely spreading,” says Tabosa. “People know that there’s no cover, and that that they’ll get quality talent. They’re not going to see some kind of amateur night.” He’s referring to the fact there is an opportunity for attendees to take the stage and rock the microphone. But it’s not an open-mic night in the conventional sense.</p>

<p>Tabosa’s band ORGANIX is the house band, and opens each event with the first set of the night. Featured artists follow. ORGANIX then retakes the stage with a jam session, and attendees are welcome to join in. </p>

<p>“If people want to get down with us, it’s cool,” he says. “But they have to jump on the train while it’s rolling.”</p>

<p>Amanda Frazier is among the fast-growing ranks of indie folk singer-songwriters, with plenty of pluck, drive, and talent. Andrew Dames is a slam poet who incorporates music into his performance. Intrepid is a hip hop MC, lyricist, composer, and dancer.</p>

<p>While the lineup for Thursday’s event holds great promise, ORGANIX alone is worth the trip to Chintatown. Audible Lab Rats and Keopu will also be on hand for an encore of their previous Venus Vibe Trap performances.</p>

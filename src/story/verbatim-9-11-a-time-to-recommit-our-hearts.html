<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the State of Hawaii join the rest of America in remembering and honoring those who lost their lives at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. In honor of the brave heroes of September 11, Gov. Linda Lingle has ordered the Hawaii State Flag at all State and county buildings to be flown at half-staff from sunrise until sunset today. The governor&#8217;s order is in conjunction with a proclamation by the President ordering the U.S. flag to be lowered. The governor also encourages Hawaii residents to display the U.S. and State flags at half-staff at their homes and businesses in observance of this day of remembrance. </p>

<p>In honor of the brave heroes of September 11, the countless Americans who united to help the victims and the dedicated service men and women who continue to protect our nation, the governor also encourages Hawaii residents to participate in community service. </p>

<p><i>The Governor’s proclamation follows:</i></p>

<p>During the tragic events of September 11, 2001, our nation saw both the worst and best sides of humanity. Close to 3,000 people, including members of our state’s ohana, lost their lives when a calm morning was shattered by hatred and destruction. On that day and in its aftermath, we saw incredible acts of heroism from police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, and everyday citizens, many of whom sacrificed their lives in order to save others. People throughout the nation gave from their hearts to help the victims. Courageous survivors rebuilt their lives. Those left behind carried on the legacy of their loved ones. </p>

<p>The aftermath of this horrific event has resonated across our nation and around the world. Though the peace and security we once took for granted within our own borders were destroyed, we ignited the enduring spirit of our nation and strengthened the unity of the American people with our resolve for freedom, justice, and democracy. Hundreds of thousands of brave men and women continue to serve every day as members of our nation’s armed forces with many having given their lives, or been injured to prevent future attacks. </p>

<p>By a joint resolution approved on December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107 89), Congress designated September 11 of each year as Patriot Day. In observance of the ninth anniversary of this tragedy, we remember and honor the memories of the innocent lives lost, while reaffirming our commitment to remain vigilant in our opposition to terrorism across the globe. </p>

<p>On March 31, 2009, Congress passed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which, for the first time, included the authorization and Federal recognition of September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance, a bill signed into law on April 21, 2009, by President Barack Obama. </p>

<p>The Corporation for National and Community Service, in conjunction with various national and local service agencies and partners, created <a href="http://Serve.gov" title="Serve.gov">Serve.gov</a>, a website that provides a convenient and accessible way to find volunteer opportunities on September 11 and throughout the year. September 11, 2010 is a time to recommit our hearts and dedication to our community, state, and nation. </p>

<p>THEREFORE, I, LINDA LINGLE, Governor of the State of Hawaii, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2010 as Patriot Day and Day of Service and Remembrance in Hawaii, and order the lowering of the Hawaii State Flag to half-staff on all state and county buildings until sunset on September 11, 2010. I also encourage our residents to display the Hawai‘i State Flag at half-staff at their homes and businesses during this time.</p>

<p>DONE at the State Capitol, in the Executive Chambers, Honolulu, State of Hawaii, this eighth day of September 2010.</p>

<p><i>Linda Lingle<br />
Governor, State of Hawaii</i></p>

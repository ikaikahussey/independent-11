<p><i>The following is a letter sent by Hawaii Democrat Ed Case, who served in the U.S. Congress from 2002 to 2007, announcing to his supporters that he will be withdrawing his candidacy for Hawaii&#8217;s First District for the upcoming 112th Congress, which begins in January 2011. The announcement follows Republican Charles Djou&#8217;s victory last month in the special vacancy election for the Congressional seat. Case split Democratic votes with party colleague Sen. Colleen Hanabusa, allowing Djou enough Republican votes to seal the victory:</i></p>

<p>Dear Friend,</p>

<p>Audrey and I are just back from our high school reunion on the Big Island. There the enduring friendships and life lessons of our youth enabled us to come to resolution on our best path forward.</p>

<p>This past week since Election Day has been a roller coaster. We&#8217;ve taken apart the results and analyzed our options every which way. I&#8217;ve listened to the heartfelt advice of my family, our incredible campaign ‘ohana and so many others who share our dreams, and asked myself how I can best contribute. If it all lined up it&#8217;d be an easy decision, but it doesn&#8217;t. Yet, a decision must be made. My heart tells me to stay in this fight, but my head says this has become the wrong fight. So today I&#8217;m withdrawing my candidacy for the U. S. House of Representatives from Hawaii&#8217;s great First District for the upcoming 112th Congress (2011-2012).</p>

<p>To our ohana, I am so deeply grateful to each and all of you. We have shared the dream of a better way forward for our Hawai‘i and country and worked so hard together to achieve it. We have truly made a difference, and must never doubt our ability to change our community and world. And I again thank the voters of Hawaii for allowing me to serve you in prior office and for your fair consideration of my candidacy this year.</p>

<p>As for my own plans, our return to our formative years reconfirmed that service has been and always will be central to my very being. </p>

<p>So the question is not whether but when, where and how I can best continue to serve, and I know that path will emerge in its own time.<br />
Audrey and I wish you and yours only the very best. I will always welcome your thoughts, and look forward to staying in touch.</p>

<p>Mahalo and aloha,</p>

<p>Ed Case</p>

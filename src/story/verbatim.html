<p><b>The following letter by Rep. Barbara Marumoto, who represents the 19th House District (Kaimuki/Waialae/Kahala), was sent to Hawaii&#8217;s Department of Education Superintendent Kathryn Matayoshi this week in opposition of closing Queen Liliuokalani Elementary School.</b></p>

<p><br />
Because I believe in the value of small schools and small classes, I would oppose the closing of any school in the 19th House District. However, in the case of Queen Lydia Liliuokalani School, history and tradition argues even more strongly against closure. It would indeed be ironic to shut its doors on the 100th school year since the Queen dedicated its opening. </p>

<p>I am here to support the friends and families of Liliuokalani who are protesting the recommendation of the Consolidation Report. I understand that the closing would save the State only $372,000 a year, and some parents even dispute that figure.</p>

<p>I ask the Board and the Department of Education to carefully consider whether the cost savings are significant enough to close a school. I ask you to weigh the effect on students who will bear the emotional burden of dislocation. If you insist on closure, consider giving the students sufficient time to adjust to the move. Perhaps five years would help, but I still believe that the cost savings are too meager to end this beloved institution in Kaimuki Town. </p>

<p><i>Representative Barbara Marumoto<br />
19th House District&#8212;Kaimuki/Waialae/Kahala</i></p>

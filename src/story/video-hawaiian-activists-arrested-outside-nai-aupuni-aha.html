<p>A video posted to Facebook by user Kaukaohu Wahilani shows several Hawaiian activists, including Kaleikoa Kaʻeo and Kahoʻokahi Kanuha allowing themselves to be arrested by Honolulu police officers in protest of the Naʻi Aupuni ʻAha on Monday, Feb. 22. The small group of activists gathered outside the Royal Hawaiian Golf Club grounds where the ʻaha is taking place and attempted to gain access to the proceedings. They were denied access but refused to leave, and [Updated] seven were arrested for trespassing.</p>

<p>In the 4 minute clip, Kaʻeo and others explain to the officers that they cannot leave because they genuinely believe the results of the ʻaha will hurt the Hawaiian people. Both the activists and the police remain calm and respectful throughout the clip.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, before the arrests, Kaʻeo, Kanuha and 18 other Hawaiian activists released a <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/hawaiian-leaders-condemn-nai-aupuni-aha">signed statement</a>&nbsp; condemning the process, which they believe, &#8220;...violates the most basic principles of self-determination, upholds the status quo, and must be rejected.&#8221;</p>

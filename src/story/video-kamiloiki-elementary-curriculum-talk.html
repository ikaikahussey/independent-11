<p>State Rep. Gene Ward (R) sits down with folks from Kamiloiki Elementary as part of his <i>A Word with Ward</i> program on Olelo. Principal Susan Okano and Curriculum/Technology Coordinator Terrie Kamo talk about efforts in meeting No Child Left Behind goals. And in an effort that&#8217;s not seen as often as it might be needed, Ward gets the perspective of a student. Fifth grade student Kalei Young is also part of the interview panel.</p>

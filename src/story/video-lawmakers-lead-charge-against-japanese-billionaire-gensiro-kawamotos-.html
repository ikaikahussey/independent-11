<p>HONOLULU&#8212;In response to <a href="http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/Museum-Plan-Unpopular-In-Kahala/x8cE3kDWR0WiiUTah7gBWQ.cspx" title="Japanese billionaire Gensiro Kawamoto's plans to establish an art museum">Japanese billionaire Gensiro Kawamoto&#8217;s plans to establish an art museum</a> on his Kahala Avenue properties, Rep. Barbara Marumoto and Sen. Sam Slom held a public discussion following residents&#8217; resistance to the idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I question whether one can start a museum in a residentially-zoned area without a variance,&#8221; Marumoto said. &#8220;I am not certain Kahala residents want such a facility in their neighborhood. </p>

<p>Marumoto listed a background of Kawamoto&#8217;s history in Kahala, and Slom presented a strategy for Kahala residents to make their case against the museum.</p>

<p>In an effort to rally community members to speak out as strongly on issues as people from other neighborhoods such as Waipahu, Ewa Beach, and Mililani, Slom said: &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s mentioned the 800 pound gorilla in the room tonight. That 800 pound gorilla is, for the most part, the people outside of Kahala and East Oahu don&#8217;t give a rip about you. They perceive you as old rich white people, and they don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

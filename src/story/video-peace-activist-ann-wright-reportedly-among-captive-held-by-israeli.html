Wright, a retired U.S. Army colonel and retired official of the U.S. State Department, known for her outspoken opposition to the Iraq War, was aboard the ship <i>Mavi Marmara</i> that was attempting to take supplies to Palestinians cut off by Israeli control. Wright&#8217;s recent interview with IHH and Newsagency has been posted on YouTube.</p>

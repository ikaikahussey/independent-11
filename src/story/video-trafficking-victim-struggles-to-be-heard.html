<p>The Pacific Alliance to Stop Slavery (PASS) put together a video showing the difficulties constituents have in reaching out to lawmakers, particularly during crunch time at &#8220;the ledge.&#8221; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=211868768838233" target="_blank">In the video</a>, after a sex-trafficking victim shared her story about being coerced and beaten in order to work as a prostitute in Hawaii, Rep. Gilbert Keith-Agaran of Maui is shown giving an awkward response to her question and suddenly leaving. The representative is considering removing &#8220;fraud&#8221; from the anti-trafficking bill.</p>

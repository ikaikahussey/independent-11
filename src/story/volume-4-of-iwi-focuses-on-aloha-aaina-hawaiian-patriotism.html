<p>HONOLULU&#8212;On Wednesday, September 1 from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., the Queen Liliuokalani Children’s Center on H?lona Street in Honolulu will host the release of <i>K?pa‘a M?kou ma hope o ka ‘?ina</i>, the fourth volume of <i>‘?iwi: A Native Hawaiian Journal.</i></p>

<p><i>K?pa‘a M?kou ma hope o ka ‘?ina,</i> or “We Stand Firm behind the Land,” focuses primarily on Native Hawaiian responses to issues of annexation, statehood, and ceded lands. A range of voices from the past to the present represent diverse views on these issues, but all are clear in their expression of aloha ‘?ina, Hawaiian patriotism and love for Hawai‘i, the native homeland.</p>

<p>“We wanted to create a text that shows the breadth and depth of Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) thoughts across time on related issues such as annexation, statehood, and the recent Lingle administration proposal to sell ceded lands. While these events span a time period of over a century, Kanaka Maoli have always been vocal and passionate about our dedication to our nation,” said Ku‘ualoha Ho‘omanawanui, president of Kuleana ‘?iwi Press, the non-profit that publishes the journal. Ho‘omanawanui also serves as the journal’s chief editor.</p>

<p>“This patriotism is reflected in the theme, ‘K?pa‘a M?kou ma hope o ka ‘?ina, We Stand Firm behind the Land,’&#8221; Ho‘omanawanui said. &#8220;These words were penned in the 1890s by Ellen Keho‘ohiwaokalani Wright Pendergrast in the song ‘Kaulana n? Pua,’ and are just as relevant to us today. Annexation, statehood, and the sale of ceded lands have had such an impact on Native Hawaiians; these issues weave together many Hawaiian voices that address the issues and their effects on our community in a variety of ways. We hope this volume helps to educate the wider community on these issues, and sparks support and deeper discussions on the effects of these decisions on all of us, not just Native Hawaiians.”</p>

<p>Volume 4 showcases works from past and contemporary Native Hawaiian artists and writers, many of whom will be available at the event for book signing. A gallery exhibit of original artwork from the visual artists featured in the issue by Meleanna Meyer, Laura Lili‘u Eckart Tomasello, Keahi Lee, ‘?maikalani Kal?hele, and K?haulani Watson will also highlight the event. The event features literary presentations and short performances by various writers in this issue.</p>

<p>‘?iwi was founded in 1997 by D. Mahealani Dudoit, an award-winning Native Hawaiian writer frustrated by oft-repeated claims that no real body of contemporary Hawaiian literature existed, that there were only a few scattered voices. ‘?iwi has made a concerted effort to gather Hawaiian voices by providing a literary environment where the Hawaiian community can artistically express themselves, just as their ancestors did in the Hawaiian language newspapers of the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p>While ‘?iwi is the first journal in modern times to feature Hawaiian writers and staff, it is a part of a much longer genealogy of similar publications stretching back to the era of the independent Hawaiian presses of the 19th century. ‘?iwi welcomes Native Hawaiians of all ages, backgrounds, education, and time periods, as the journal includes materials reprinted and sometimes translated from the Hawaiian language newspapers of the past.</p>

<p>Dudoit unexpectedly passed away in 2002, just days before the release of the second volume of <i>‘?iwi, K?nihi ka Mauna.</i> Since then, the handful of all-volunteer staff of mostly students has struggled to keep the journal going. </p>

<p>“M?healani worked too hard for too long to get ‘?iwi established to just let it go,” Ho‘omanawanui said. “Besides, we have a tremendous amount of support from the Hawaiian and general community. We don’t want to disappoint everyone.”</p>

<p><i>‘?iwi: A Native Hawaiian Journal</i> is currently seeking submissions volume 5. The theme is &#8220;Malama: Hawaiian Art and Environment.&#8221; Deadline for submissions is December 1, 2010. </p>

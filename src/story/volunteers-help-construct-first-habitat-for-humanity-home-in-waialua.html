<p>NORTH SHORE&#8212;Approximately 100 Honolulu Habitat for Humanity (HFA) volunteers have been dedicating their weekends since early September to construct a new two-bedroom home for James and Tamako Vasconcellos, residents of Waialua for over 50 years. The couple was recently approved or a 20-year, no interest loan through Habitat for Humanity to build the new residence in place of their former four-bedroom home where they raised their four children, which was torn down in July to make room for the new 930 square foot house where Tamako is already planning to have sleepovers with her grandchildren.</p>

<p>“The old house was only standing because the termites were holding hands,&#8221; joked Maile Alau, Development Director for Honolulu Habitat for Humanity. &#8220;The new house fits them [the Vasconcellos&#8217;s]. Their grandchildren can come sleep over and it will be much easier for them to take care of.” </p>

<p>During the eighth weekend of construction, volunteers installed the floor of the HPM Building Supply kit home and raised the walls. The Vasconcellos residence is HFH’s fist project in Waialua.</p>

<p>“Last weekend we got the interior walls up and painted them, and this weekend we are expecting to get the roof trusses up,” said Alau on Friday.</p>

<p>The property shares a border with the couple’s eldest daughter Anne’s home where James and Tamako are staying until their new home is finished. James, who is retired from Meadow Gold, and Tamako both grew up in Waialua and said they feel lucky to have all four of their children living near by in the Central Oahu area.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vasconcellos said her children are happy for their parents even though “there are a lot of memories in the old house,” which the couple bought over 50 years ago.</p>

<p>Often confused with a “free home,” assistance from HFH requires elbow grease and work from loan recipients. According to Alau, HFH secures a loan for Habitat families, which is then paid back free of interest over a 20-year period. Alau explained that the first step to securing a “Habitat home” is conducting a family information session, followed by other steps including “sweat equity,” which is 250 hours of volunteer service on another Habitat family’s house, as well as 250 hours of volunteer work on the family’s own home.</p>

<p>“We do an interview, a site visit, there’s a lot of steps,” explained Alau.</p>

<p>Families eligible for HFH help must have an income 30 to 60 percent of the median income for the family size, and provide vacant land to construct the home on. If the land previously had a home on it, the recipient family is responsible for demolition fees.</p>

<p>Honolulu Habitat for Humanity is one of three branches on Oahu, and eight in the state.</p>

<p>“We have seven affiliates and work with [the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands] real closely,” Alau said.</p>

<p>HFH is the eighth largest residential construction company in the nation and the first in the world.</p>

<p>“Every 17 minutes, or so, someone is getting the keys to their Habitat home,” Alau said.</p>

<p>Funded by tax?deductible contributions and aided by thousands of volunteers, HFH helps in-need families become homeowners when they may not have the opportunity elsewhere. Their monthly house payments are returned to a “Fund for Humanity” used to build more homes for families around the world.</p>

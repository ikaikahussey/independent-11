<p>HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;It&#8217;s the mission of the Hawaii Wildlife Center to protect, conserve, and aid in the recovery of Hawaii’s native wildlife through training, treatment, and education programs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Last Saturday, more than 100 volunteers of all ages gathered at the Hawaii Wildlife Center in Kapaau for a hands-on community volunteer day and the inaugural planting of Native Hawaiian landscaping. </p>

<p>Landscape Architect Jason Umemoto of Umemoto Cassandro Design Corporation loaned his expertise to oversee volunteers’ efforts as they planted Loulu Lelo, Ho’awa, Ae’Ae, Uki’Uki, Palapalai fern, Naio Papa, Pohinahina, Akia, and other native plants.</p>

<p>Kohala Middle School students, teachers, and the principal were joined by volunteers from Hawaii Preparatory Academy, home schooled children and parents, Aikane Nursery, and Chambers Landscaping to help with the planting.</p>

<p>“Students and the community have been involved in the development of the Hawaii Wildlife Center from ground up and this is just one more step that brings us closer to completion,” said Linda Elliott, Hawaii Wildlife Center&#8217;s president and director. </p>

<p>The volunteer day included tours of the facility and the opportunity to meet the non-profit organization’s board of directors. Volunteers received posters, gift cards, and stickers donated by the Conservation Council for Hawaii.</p>

<p>The Hawaii Wildlife Center plans to offer further opportunities for collaboration with the Kohala School Complex for hands-on learning programs in math, science and conservation both during, and after school. </p>

<p>The center&#8217;s 4,500 square foot building includes rooms for wildlife intake, holding, washing, drying, food preparation, lab work, medical treatment and isolation. </p>

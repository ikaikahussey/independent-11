<p>WAIMANALO&#8212;Oahu residents seem to agree that Waimanalo is beautiful. Every weekend you can find people enjoying the natural beauty of Waimanalo: biking the back roads, admiring the towering Koolau Mountains, or swimming in the beautiful bay. </p>

<p>On Saturday January 22, residents have an opportunity to care for these natural resources by participating in the Second Annual Waimanalo Community Clean-Up and Recycling Day. </p>

<p>The event will be held from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at the Waimanalo Beach Park and encourages local residents to recycle scrap metal (including vehicles and appliances), cellular phones, computers, printer cartridges, batteries, tires, magazines, and more. </p>

<p>Curbside pick-up can be arranged for Waimanalo residents unable to haul their recyclable materials to the beach park, and towing of unwanted vehicles is also available. </p>

<p>The clean-up is being organized by <a href="http://www.huihawaii.org/" title="Hui o Koolaupoko">Hui o Koolaupoko</a> and the <a href="http://www.oahurcd.org/" title="Oahu Resource Conservation and Development Council">Oahu Resource Conservation and Development Council</a>, with support from Schnitzer Steel Hawaii, the City and County of Honolulu, and the Hawaii Department of Health. </p>

<p>“This is the second year we’ve partnered with the City’s Aloha Aina Earth Day Program,” said Kristen Nalani Mailheau, community coordinator for Hui o Ko‘olaupoko. “Last year we recycled six pallets of computers and electronic equipment, 60 tires, numerous batteries, and a variety of scrap metal.”</p>

<p>Volunteers can sign-up to sort the recyclable materials at the Beach Park, or they can join a “Street and Stream Clean-up Team” to pick up litter throughout the watershed. </p>

<p>Businesses and organizations are invited to sponsor the event to help cover costs of hauling the materials to the appropriate recycling or disposal location, or they can support the event by donating supplies.</p>

<p>So far, pledges of support have been received from Castle Medical Center, The Plant Place, Hawaiian Sunshine Nursery, Nalo Farms, Shima’s Supermarket, and the Waimanalo Ag Association. State Rep. Chris Lee’s office is helping to promote the event, and Hui Malama O Ke Kai is leading the street and stream clean-up efforts. </p>

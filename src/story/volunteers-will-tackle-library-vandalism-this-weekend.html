<p>Mahalo Hawaii Independent for reporting on this story.&nbsp; Volunteers will be tackling the cleaning job this Saturday (2/26) and Sunday (2/27) from noon-4pm.&nbsp; Vaccums would be welcome, but if you even have an hour or two to spare, many hands will make the work go more quickly!&nbsp; Please feel free to call 393-0594 if you have any questions about clean-up efforts.</p>

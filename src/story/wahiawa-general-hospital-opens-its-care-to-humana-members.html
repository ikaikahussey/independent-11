<p>WAHIAWA&#8212;Wahiawa General Hospital is now providing in-network medical care to Medicare Advantage members enrolled with Humana, the fourth largest medical care provider in the United States. The new contract allows members to seek medical treatment from the Central Oahu hospital without out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

<p>“The contract with Wahiawa General Hospital provides Humana members with another option,&#8221; said a Humana spokesperson. &#8220;It allows them another provider that may be more conveniant and near their home or workplace.&#8221; </p>

<p>In-network means that while emergency room services were usually covered by Humana at any hospital, regular treatments and appointments would previously have cost members out-of-pocket expenses if sought at Wahiawa General Hospital.</p>

<p>Under the new contract, which began January 19, members of Humana’s Medicare Advantage Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), an alternative to original Medicare and not a supplemental plan, and Private Fee For Service (PFFS) plans have in-network benefit access to the hospital and its 160-bed facility. Wahiawa General Hospital provides all levels of patient care, including 107 beds in a long-term care facility. In-network benefits are also included for Humana’s Medicare Advantage members at Wahiawa General’s Specialty Clinic.</p>

<p>The new contract with Wahiawa General may save Central Oahu and North Shore residents a long drive. Previously, only Castle Medical Center, Queen’s Medical Center, and Hawaii Pacific Health were options for Humana members. </p>

<p>McLerran said contracts with the three hospitals were signed in 2009. Humana Medicare Advantage members now have access to specialists in Wahiawa for allergy, cardiology, gastroenterology, geriatrics, podiatry, rheumatology, urology and others treatments.</p>

<p>“Opening Wahiawa General Hospital to Humana Medicare Advantage members means residents of Oahu have another option to access health care,” said Susan Rich, assistant administrator of quality at Wahiawa General Hospital. “We welcome the opportunity to treat and improve the health of Humana’s Medicare Advantage members, moving closer to our goal of becoming the provider of choice for residents of Central Oahu and the North Shore.”</p>

<p>Humana health care has been present in Hawaii for nearly four years. The 50-year-old company, that has its headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky, has approximately 10.1 million medical members, 7.0 million specialty members, and operates more than 300 medical centers and 240 worksite medical facilities.</p>

<p>City monthly reports:</p>

<p>Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) – Capt. Scott Fukumae reported the following information:</p>

<p>Statistics for June 2010 – Included 1 structure, 1 wildland, 1 rubbish and 57 medical emergencies; no major or unusual incidents were reported.<br />
Fire Safety Tip – As summer approaches, the island will be at higher risk for fires due to dry vegetation and hot weather. Residents are encouraged to use caution when utilizing flame-producing devices and reminded that children under the age of 18 shall not possess fireworks, matches, and/or lighters, except under adult supervision.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>1) Relating to the Homeless – At least 95% of the homeless near the bridges have been relocated.<br />
2) Statistics on Fireworks – Enforcement will begin on June 30, 2010 to curb illegal fireworks.</p>

<p>Honolulu Police Department (HPD) – Lt. Benjamin Ballesteros, Jr. reported the following information:</p>

<p>May 2010 Statistics – Included 16 burglaries, 20 unauthorized entry into motor vehicles, 33 thefts, 5 auto thefts with 8 recoveries, and 5 graffiti.<br />
Safety Tip – Citizen’s concerns and complaints are welcome anytime; however, it is best to report crime and concerns as they are occurring or being observed. Incidents may be anonymously reported; however, responding officers may enforce only ‘on-view’ violations. Violations or crimes may need complainants and witnesses to come forward to be investigated and enforced.<br />
New District HPD Officers – Introduced were Major Ken Simmons newly appointed to the Wahiawa District and Sgt. Vivian of the Community Policing Team.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>1) Seasonal Crime – Wahiawa was considered to have a low crime rate compared to other districts. There was the usual seasonal crime increase during summer and holidays. HPD usually will support those areas targeted by high crime known as ‘hot points or spots’. HPD are also busy during the months of May and June when graduation parties are held to curb the all night loud parties and drinking in residential areas.<br />
2) Burglary Defense – HPD recommends allowing them to handle burglary events; however, if you are being overcome with force then in self defense one should forcefully defend one self against the burglar. The best defense is for the homeowner to get out of the home away from the burglar before a struggle.<br />
3) Fireworks – HPD will cite and arrest those violating the law in public as well as parks.</p>

<p>Board Vacant Seats – There are no vacant seats at this time.</p>

<p>Mayor Mufi Hannemann – A report was read by Chair Acohido from the Mayor’s office:</p>

<p>Our Lady of Sorrows Property – The City Department of Community Services have no objection if the community wishes to pursue use of the privately owned site as a homeless shelter; however, funding and security would be concerns of the property owners. Land use restriction would apply without any city role in these areas.<br />
Public Transportation at Whitmore Village – Currently, there is no budget to provide bus service; however the short range transit plan effort is reviewing bus service island-wide and certain to include Whitmore Village as part of this effort. Also, keeping in mind, the rail transit will liberate buses from the congested primary corridor to allow for more buses to be extended in areas such as Whitmore Village.<br />
Sidewalk Blocked – There were currently no obstructions on Kamehameha Highway sidewalk.<br />
Strobe Lights – According to a field check by the City Department of Transportation Services (DTS), blinking lights were never installed at Avocado/Walker Streets.<br />
Speed Bump Re-Stripping – A work order was issued for the work to be done at Walker and Avocado Streets.<br />
Wahiawa Transit Center (WTC) – There was a report that the WTC will not have public bathrooms.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>1) WTC – A private bathroom will not do the public any good if they can’t use it; the public was urged to continue asking the City to provide the WTC a public bathroom.<br />
2) California Avenue – Depending on the weather, the project is slated to take about a year beginning in November 2010. The project entails a total resurfacing to include replacement of several layers of surface.</p>

<p>Board of Water Supply (BWS) – Thomas Young reported the following information:</p>

<p>- Drinking Water Standards – BWS works hard to ensure that the water served to residents meets or exceeds all federal and state safe drinking water standards and wants to reassure residents that the water served is safe to drink. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the federal law that governs the quality of drinking water in the United States. Under the SDWA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards for drinking water quality and oversees state compliance with those standards. In Hawaii, the State Department of Health (DOH) is responsible for ensuring that all public and private drinking water suppliers comply with all laws for safe drinking water. The DOH and EPA is responsible to monitor and enforce these regulations.<br />
- BWS Water Tests – Every year BWS and DOH conducts thousands of tests on the water source and distribution systems to ensure that the water you receive is safe to drink. These tests check for more than 100 different types of contaminants, as required by the EPA. All final test results show the BWS is in full compliance with state and federal standards for safe drinking water. If the water quality tests conducted did not meet safe standards; BWS would be required by law to immediately notify impacted customers and more importantly, BWS would stop serving the water until it met all water regulations. Bottom line, our BWS water is safe to drink.<br />
- Water Treatment – BWS treats water in accordance with all federal and state drinking water regulations. Currently, the BWS treats drinking water with chlorine and in certain areas of Oahu the water is treated with granular activated carbon.<br />
- What is in the Water – Water quality test results are shared with customers in the annual water quality report or Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) as required by the EPA.&nbsp; The report along with an accompanying water quality information pamphlet is mailed each year to BWS customers by July 1. The CCR identifies where your water comes from, what regulated contaminants were found, how those levels compare to the standards for safe drinking water, and describes any treatment processes used. Reports are also available on BWS’s website.<br />
- Water Conservation/Leaks – It has been a dry year; consider some conservation measures; Oahu is experiencing a continued seven year drought. Residents experiencing a spike in their water bills should check for water leaks. It is suggested to shut the water valve off first and if the dial is still spinning, this means there is a water leak to repair. The BWS repair line is 748-5000.<br />
- Lake Wilson – Kahe Point only has one fire hydrant and HFD uses Lake Wilson as a backup when needed to extinguish fires in the area.<br />
- Furlough Fridays – The BWS’s Beretania Street office will be closed only one Friday a month; however, BWS is working on a staggering office schedule to keep coverage 24/7 for service.<br />
You can reach BWS at 748-5041 or log onto to the web at www.boardofwatersupply.com.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Water Filter Use – BWS reports the water it provides is safe for drinking; however, residents can opt to use filters if they choose. Pipes within residents are the responsibility of the homeowners. BWS provides charcoal chlorination filtered water for the areas of North Shore to Kunia due to agriculture land and other areas chlorinated only. About 400 BWS pump stations are annually tested.</p>

<p>Councilmember Donovan Dela Cruz – Keanu Young reported the following information:</p>

<p>Emergency Sirens – In order to ensure public safety, Oahu’s warning system must be operational in all areas. There has been several Council committee meeting discussions addressing the issue of the government installation, repair, and updating of Civil Defense sirens. After introducing Resolution 10-59 addressing the need; 71 sirens will be upgraded and 53 additional installations are pending for Oahu’s total of 143 of the 267 sirens needed statewide.<br />
Capital Improvements Projects (CIP) – The City hopes to start construction this fall on a 4-foot high chain link fence and concrete mowing strip for the Mililani Mauka Community Park (MMCP). Usage is high at the park because there are only two City parks in the mauka area. In the 2009 fiscal year (FY) CIP, $250,000 was appropriated to design and construct the fence at MMCP. In FY 2011, the City appropriated $140,000 to construct playground equipment at MMCP as well as $690,000 to construct basketball and tennis courts.<br />
Bill 34 – Councilmember Gary Okino has introduced Bill 34 to consider an outright ban on fireworks.&nbsp; The July 14, 2010 is when the City Council is due to vote on the bill.<br />
Roadways – The City Department of Facility Maintenance has completed filling much of the pot holes reported.<br />
City Council – The Council voted Lee Donohue, a 40-year veteran of HPD, to fill a vacant seat on the City Council left vacant by now Congressman Djou.<br />
Council Action – Filed was Bill 15, relating to the City Executive Operating Budget and Program for the FY 2010/11. Second Reading: Bill 16 relating to the Executive Budget and Programs for the FY 2010/11. Real Property Taxes (RPT): Resolution 10-60 lists all of the proposed rates for the various real property tax classifications. Mayor Hannemann’s budget proposed to raise non-homeowners class rates from $3.42 to $3.72 per every $1,000; these figures represent a starting point for discussion and the Council is searching for ways to reduce this increase.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>1) Bill 43 – What is Councilmember Dela Cruz’s opinion regarding this Bill; K. Young will consult with the Councilmember.<br />
2) Bill 23 – The Bill relating to agriculture dwelling has been incorporated into Bill 24 by the City Department of Planning and Permitting Task Force; amending the Bill to propose limiting dwelling space on agriculture. A public hearing on this matter is pending.<br />
3) Traffic Calming – Some cities on the U.S. mainland have installed a safety measure curbing speeding. This measure places a small dip in the roadway preventing vehicles from </p>

The 130 Unit have returned from duty and will hold their service this Friday, June 25 at 10:00 a.m. at Hamilton Field.

July 4 Celebrations – The Schofield gates will begin allowing families onto the base for festivities celebrating our nation’s birthday at 1:00 p.m.; fireworks begin at 8:30 p.m. Proper vehicle documents and a valid driver’s license will be required to enter the base.<br />

<p>Reports:</p>

<p>Chair’s Report – Chair Acohido reported the following: </p>

<p>Certificate of Appreciation for Mr. Fred Sol, Wahiawa District Complex – A request was pending to present F. Sol with an appreciation certificate for his services to the community.<br />
Wahiawa Bus Transit Center – The subject was discussed earlier during the meeting tonight. As noted, it’s reported the facility will not offer a public bathroom.<br />
Request Status Report of Wahiawa Wastewater Facility – A $26.5 million dollar bid was awarded to Oceanic Companies to begin improvements meeting EPA standards at the Wahiawa facility; it’s the oldest facility on Oahu. The work begins in September 2010 for the back system and in December for the front system.&nbsp; This work does not entail any expansion; only upgrades to the existing footprint.</p>

<p>Committees:</p>

<p>Dam/Waterway – Hugh Lowery reported the following information:</p>

<p>Lake Wilson – Dole and Howard Green have agreed to repair the Ford gate in order to control the water-flow at Lake Wilson. The spillway water repairs will cost over $1 million dollars. Rainwater overflow mixed with sewage is being dumped into the lake which the State Department of Health says it’s approved as R1; however, a report was still pending from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to share with the community. A continue effort with all agencies including the North Shore area was ongoing to provide necessary answers; and in the hope that someday, fish caught at the lake can be safe for human consumption. A meeting held by the EPA was not noticed to the Wahiawa community; therefore, a report on the flooding mitigation was not available. Community input was due to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by June 30, 2010 in order to receive this status report. A May 20, 2010 report in the local Wahiawa newspaper can be helpful as it covers the history on the waterways in the North Shore and Wahiawa districts.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:<br />
1) Lake Wilson – The upper area of the lake is currently under collaboration between the City and the Army.<br />
2) R1 Water – It was not yet known if any of the water was going to be made available to Schofield Barracks. The Army was in consultation with contractors before it can accept any of the water; excess water will be provided to the farmers in the North Shore.</p>

<p>Transportation – Joeseph Francher reported the following information:</p>

<p>OMPO – A regional meeting is slated for August; public input is needed regarding the survey.<br />
State Department of Transportation – Repairs to bridges on Farrington Highway are underway including the Route 93 Bridge.<br />

<p>Presentations:</p>

<p>Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for Bethel Bible Church (BBC) – Elder William Hopper shared the following information:</p>

<p>Location – BBC has been meeting at 1066 Kilani Avenue since 1978; a rental facility until the YMCA placed the facility up for sale in October 2004. God answers prayers sending Realtor Peter Savio which purchased the facility and the portion now occupied by the BBC was subdivided and sold to BBC. BBC continued to worship at this facility making necessary renovations preserving the buildings. Currently, there are no immediate occupying neighbors at this corner of Koa Street and Kilani Avenue. Fronting the building is the public park and tennis courts; at the Koa Street side, is a parking lot; at the other side is the unfinished Parkside at Wahiawa building project; and at the rear, is the Hawaiian Tel parking lot. The building is now up for sale in the unfinished condition it is in.<br />
LUC – DPP required BBC to appear before the Board presenting the community with this request for the issuance of the LUC.<br />
A short recess was called at 8:15 to 8:20 p.m. to review documents.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>1) Congregation – There were about 75 current members at BBC.<br />
2) Updates – Contractors may offer some progress update on behalf of the church once work begins; this presentation concludes that BBC has followed DPP procedures to fulfill their permit request.</p>

<p>Application for Zoning Change on Kilani Property – Patrick Low reported the following information:</p>

<p>Location – Currently at the 1044 Kilani Avenue was a bakery in the apartment building zoned as B2; however, the change proposes a change to zone A2 to reflect paying the lower tax rate of $3.55 versus $12.40 which is the current rate for zone B2.<br />

<p>Study Meeting – The public was urged to attend the meeting slated for July 22, 2010 beginning at 6:00 p.m. at Hale O Kipa. This meeting will entail researching plantation history to preserve the value of the area both past and present. It was hopeful that many will spread the word regarding the meeting to residents with known name in the history of Wahiawa to attend and share their knowledge.<br />
Development – No development is proposed at any site considering for the study; culture locations and preserving landscape will be the focus to define those areas.</p>

<p>Questions, comments and concerns followed:</p>

<p>Healing Stone – The stone was a separate issue; however, it may be part of the study definition. Several Hawaiian groups were involved in the upkeep of the healing stone site before it was moved. The site was becoming somewhat of a safety issue due to many visitors driving through to visit the healing stone site. Further study was needed to actually determine the factual decedents based under international law. It was told the stone was first moved in 1920; and in 1940 it ended up at the Wahiawa gravesite that was considered now sacred. Many have testified to have felt healed after contact with the stone. It’s rumored the stone has been returned to its original birth place.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Board business:</p>

<p>Wahiawa McDonalds Remodeling – Chair Acohido reported the following information:</p>

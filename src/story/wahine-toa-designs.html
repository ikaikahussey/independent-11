HAWAII ISLAND&#8212;A &#8220;trunk sale&#8221; held by Nita Pilago, owner of Wahine Toa designs, last month was a hit with Hawaii Island residents looking for deals on native design fashion.</p>

<p>The sale started at 10:00 a.m. in the living room her son’s home in Kaumana (about 250 sq.ft.) and was filled with people within minutes. There were five racks full of dresses, tanks, skirts, and pareus. The crowd, consisting mainly of women, kept flooding in through the doors until about noon. The clothes flew off the racks with everyone on their best behavior. Pilago and her family helped to keep the atmosphere fun and friendly, making for a pleasant shopping experience.</p>

<p>The trunk sale was largely a grassroots effort. A few weeks prior to the sale, Pilago posted a notice on her Facebook page and e-mailed friends and family. The event itself was meant to satisfy pent-up demand for Pilago&#8217;s unique fashion. With an early sell-out at this year’s Merrie Monarch Festival, Wahine Toa is extremely popular among dancers and all members of the family on Hawaii Island.</p>

<p>“It’s surreal to see people wearing my clothes,” Pilago said.&nbsp; She especially loves to see full-figured women looking good; that’s why Wahine Toa designs are made for all body types. </p>

<p>When her husband, politician Angel Pilago, decided to run for mayor in 2007, Nita left her job of 14 years at Costco to help him campaign and pursue her dream of designing her own clothing line&#8212;resulting in the Wahine Toa brand we know and love today.</p>

<p>It was hard at first because everything was handmade, but she stuck with it, eventually taking the manufacturing overseas, Pilago explained. She searched for the perfect partner, someone who could put aloha into their product, and finally decided on a manufacturer in Indonesia. </p>

<p>Wahine Toa remains a family-owned and operated business. Nita, her husband Angel, her sons Che and Kaleo, are all artists contributing behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Nita says her designs are made to empower women. The six current themes are Wahine Toa, Ahapuaa, Tiare, Plumeria, Kalo, and Hihimanu. Wahine Toa represents the duality of women, who are strong yet nurturing. It conveys the dignity a woman must uphold and honors them as givers of the breath of life. </p>

<p>Wahine Toa can be found at Nita’s home in Kona, Maoli Arts on Oahu, Iolani Palace, Native Books, and Jeff Hunt’s Surf Shop in Pahoa. Nita also participates in various open markets and events such as Hoea Ea, Waimea Aloha Week, and Nawahi’s Hoolaulea. </p>

<p>Keep an eye out for her new summer line.</p>

<p>This coming Friday and Saturday, May 14-15, Waialae Charter School will present &#8220;Cinderella&#8221; in the school&#8217;s dining hall at 7:00 p.m. This production will be based on the Disney musical and will feature beloved hits such as &#8220;A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes&#8221; and &#8220;Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>70 fourth and fifth graders auditioned for the play last December, out of which 33 were chosen.&nbsp; The remainder are working backstage building sets, sewing costumes, preparing props, and learning the technical side of a production.&nbsp; The children have been working hard during after-school hours since January preparing for the play.&nbsp; </p>

<p>WESPA (Wai`alae Elementary School Performing Arts) has been funded from donations, many from prior school years, in addition to grants for after-school programs.&nbsp; Waialae music teacher, Dian Hermes, also credits the community for their help and support.&nbsp; In particular, she is grateful to the Hawaii Local 665 chapter of International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (I.A.T.S.E), the union responsible for the local filming of hits such as &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; and &#8220;Lost,&#8221; for donating free labor on Sundays towards building the set.</p>

<p>Admission to the 45 minute performance is free, but donations will be accepted.&nbsp; Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and it is recommended that patrons arrive as early as possible to secure a seat; they are expecting large crowds!</p>

<p>Waialae School is a K-5 elementary school located at 1045 19th Avenue in Kaimuki. In 1995, the school became Hawaii&#8217;s first Student-Centered School and then four years later, with the passage of Hawaii&#8217;s &#8220;charter school law,&#8221; evolved into a New Century Public Charter School.</p>

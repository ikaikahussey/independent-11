<p>HONOLULU&#8212;When the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center and Waianae High School teamed up a few months ago to reintroduce the popular west side farmers market, the two organizations and their staff never imagined it taking off the way it did in only its first week. Now, with more than 16 vendors and a variety of new products, the market appears to have cemented itself as a neighborhood staple.</p>

<p>Hundreds of local residents and visitors arrived early on Saturday, May 1, to see the new variety of vendors and get their hands on the fresh produce, plants, and food products for sale.</p>

<p>New vendors, such as Surfah Smoodeez, Asantae Java, Woody&#8217;s Hot Dogs, and Ono Kettle Korn have joined the market. You&#8217;ll find everything from lobster tails to specialty coffee and designer jewelry. From small keiki to seniors, the Waianae Farmers&#8217; Market now offers something for everyone.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;I just love the market, its new location, and all the variety now,&#8221; said Georgia Campbell, a Waianae resident and one of Waianae Farmers Market&#8217;s regular shoppers.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Kahumana Farms and Waianae High School also bring a variety of goods to the new market. Kahumana Farms sells a variety of local, organic produce, including basil, arugula, carrots, and beets. Waianae High School sells local, organic produce, fresh ogo, and baked goods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the Waianae Farmers Market as a way to promote what the students are growing and making in class,&#8221; said Lei Aken. Waianae High School&#8217;s small farm was certified organic over a year ago. Today, the students are growing a bounty of produce, including organic mesclun lettuces, bananas, and a variety of leafy greens.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And you can&#8217;t get much fresher. The greens and other goods travel less than two miles to get to the market. Kahumana Farms is located in Lualualei valley, and, of course, the students&#8217; produce is just steps away from the market&#8217;s new location.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;The bag of salad mix I bought from Waianae High School&#8217;s booth was so fresh and green,&#8221; said Bryan Talisayan, Program Manager at Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center. &#8220;I bought two bags and my second bag is still looking fresh after a week,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Unlike much of the produce found in grocery stores, the fruits and vegetables found at the farmers market are picked just before the market, making the fruits and vegetables as fresh as possible.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>&#8220;The reason the Waianae Farmers&#8217; Market is so important to Waianae residents is because freshly picked produce contain vital nutrients that contain important antioxidants that protect against disease, such as cancer and heart disease,&#8221; said Anne Thiessen, Registered Dietitian at Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center and Clinical Herbalist. These nutrients can be lost during the transport from overseas, resulting in less nutritious produce and a shorter shelf life.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Through a grant received by Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), REACH U.S., registered dietitians, such as Thiessen, provide cooking demonstrations and free recipes at the Waianae Farmers Market once a month. </p>

<p>Up for grabs at the grand re-opening on May 1st were &#8220;onolicious&#8221; Okinawan Sweet Potato Muffins.&nbsp; </p>

<p>With over 16 vendors, food sampling, keiki attractions, cultural activities, new products, and promotional items, the Waianae Farmers Market is fast becoming a local &#8220;hot-spot&#8221; and a career opportunity for those in search of showing off their skills.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&#8220;The market is responding directly to our economic crisis by creating jobs and encouraging people to spend money in Waianae,&#8221; said Rep. Maile Shimabukuro, who is also a regular customer at the Waianae Farmers Market. &#8220;And I see that our community is really enjoying the social environment that the market provides,&#8221; she added.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Waianae Farmers Market&#8217;s mission is to increase access and availability to fresher, local produce, while reducing food costs and providing a social and educational atmosphere where the community can discover where their food comes from.</p>

<p><i>The Waianae Farmers Market is open every Saturday at the Waianae High School, from 8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. It is the only farmers market on Oahu to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (S.N.A.P.) benefits (aka E.B.T. or food stamps).

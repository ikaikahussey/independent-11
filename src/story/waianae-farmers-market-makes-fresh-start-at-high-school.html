<p>WAIANAE&#8212;The upcoming grand re-opening of the Waianae Farmers&#8217; Market is a welcome upgrade for residents of Oahu&#8217;s west coast. The market&#8217;s new Saturday location at Waianae High School allows for more vendors and increased convenience.</p>

<p>Owned and operated by the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (WCCHC), Waianae Farmers&#8217; Market has grown significantly within the community since opening in June 2008. The market has managed to attract hundreds of visitors and residents every Saturday at its previous location in WCCHC&#8217;s main parking lot and campus.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, the market has seen a surge in attendance, with shoppers arriving earlier every week&#8212;before tents are even set up. The market&#8217;s growth called for a bigger location that could accommodate the growing number of vendors and shoppers. </p>

<p>&#8220;When it comes to quality and value, the market vendors got this, hands down,&#8221; said market manager Desiree Hikuroa. &#8220;Our main challenge has been location, location, location.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hikuroa looked to the local high school campus as a key site for the new Waianae Farmers Market because it was surrounded by a residential area and conveniently located just off Farrington Highway. Waianae High School&#8217;s campus also offers more free parking than the health center location. </p>

<p>WCCHC&#8217;s new partner, Waianae High School, welcomed their new role as host to the community marketplace.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are so excited about hosting the farmers market on our campus,&#8221; said Lei Aken, Waianae High School&#8217;s agriculture instructor. &#8220;The students have worked hard on the farm, and we are finally producing healthy, organic produce that we are ready to share with the community.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the long drive out to Waianae may seem daunting for those who don&#8217;t live in the closely knitted Waianae Coast, market regulars maintain that the value in the product is definitely worth the miles.</p>

<p>And beyond the fresh veggies and fruits, other featured products include pork lau lau from Ulu Ke Kukui, Aunty Nani&#8217;s cookies, a variety of plants and orchids from Pili Pots, and fresh cheese and churned butter from Waianae&#8217;s Naked Cow Dairy. </p>

<p>&#8220;The fact that we are able to help increase the availability of local, fresh produce to our community goes hand-in-hand with educating our children about nutrition and health,&#8221; said Nelson Shigeta, Waianae High School&#8217;s principal.</p>

<p>The Waianae Farmers&#8217; Market will hold a special celebration on Saturday with the help of a recent $20,000 grant from Hawaiian Electric Company. Festivities include live music, cultural activities, and hands-on demonstrations.</p>

<p>There will also be tons of free giveaways, including Waianae Farmers Market calendars, sports bottles, reusable bags, coupons, and plants. In addition, Naked Cow Dairy, Oahu&#8217;s only dairy located in Waianae, will be sponsoring a keiki petting zoo. A traditional Hawaiian blessing will be held by Kamaki Kanahele, along with a hula performance by Halau Hula O Kekaikuihala.</p>

<p>Beginning with the grand re-opening on Saturday, May 1, Waianae Farmers&#8217; Market will open a half hour earlier at 8:00 a.m.</p>

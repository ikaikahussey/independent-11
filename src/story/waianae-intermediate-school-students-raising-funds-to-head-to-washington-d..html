<p>WAIANAE&#8212;Twenty students from Waianae Intermediate School are hoping that with an early start they can raise enough money to go to Washington, D.C., to attend a 6-day program that allows students from across the nation to experience democracy in action.</p>

<p>State Rep. Maile Shimabukuro, who represents a portion of Waianae, recently made a donation and is encouraging other residents to donate what they can.</p>

<p>&#8220;Civic education should be for everyone, not just the most privileged,” Shimabukuro said. “Most of our students need to fundraise to pay for the $2,600 all-inclusive cost to attend the program. Our students need local community support. Any contributions would be an investment in our community’s future.”</p>

<p>The Close Up Foundation is a nonprofit civic education organization that provides students with challenging, hands-on civic education programs for students and teachers in Washington, D.C. These programs use the nation’s capital as a living classroom where participants get a “close up” view of government and democracy in action. Students meet and talk with members of the U.S. Congress and House of Representatives as well as interact and make long-lasting friendship with other students from across the nation.</p>

<p>Elten Lau, the counselor coordinating the program at the school, said: “During their week in Washington, the students attend seminars on Capitol Hill and will meet with our very own government officials, political experts, and even lobbyists, to better understand the branches of government and the ways in which they can become more involved community citizens.”</p>

<p><i>Close Up Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization, and contributions may be tax-deductible. For more information on Close Up and their mission, call 800-CLOSE UP (256-7387), or visit <a href="http://www.closeup.org" title="www.closeup.org">www.closeup.org</a>.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Maintaining a boundary that protects the region’s agriculture, open space, and natural resources.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Promoting diversified agriculture.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Enhancing educational and recreational resources.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Improving the transportation and other infrastructure systems.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Supporting a light industrial park in Lualualei.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Supporting a Nanakuli Regional Park for the Waianae Coast.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Preserving cultural resources.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Recognizing and adapting the ahupuaa concept and incorporating principles of sustainability into the land use management process.</p>

<p><br />
A community informational meeting on the draft revised plan will be held by the Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting. The plan will then be reviewed by the Honolulu Planning Commission, whose recommendations will be forwarded to the Honolulu City Council for further review and adoption. The Planning Commission hearing is tentatively scheduled for December 15. Once adopted, the plan will guide decisions and actions related to land use, infrastructure, zoning, and urban design matters.</p>

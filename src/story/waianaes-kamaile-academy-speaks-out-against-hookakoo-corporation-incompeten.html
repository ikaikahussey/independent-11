<p>WAIANAE&#8212;Since the firing of Kamaile Academy&#8217;s CEO and principal earlier this month, the mood on campus has been &#8220;like somebody died,&#8221; said Calveena Gomez, a parent and teacher at the charter school in Waianae.</p>

<p>Gomez said that she had been trying for weeks to make counseling services available to her students and other staff without a response. She said the delay is another example of &#8220;incompetence&#8221; and a neglect for children&#8217;s needs by the charter school&#8217;s overseeing board.</p>

<p>Kamaile Academy is overseen by the <a href="http://www.hookakoo.org/index.php/site/leadership" title="Ho’okako’o Corporation">Ho’okako’o Corporation</a>, a private non-profit organization established in 2002 to improve the quality of education offered to Hawaii’s children through conversion charter schools.</p>

<p>Last week, parents, students, and teachers berated members of Ho’okako’o Corporation&#8217;s board for the <a href="http://www.thehawaiiindependent.com/story/hookakoo-board-members-for-the-recent-firing-of-glenn-kila-and-clarence-del/" title="November 9 firing of the school's CEO Glenn Kila and president Clarence DeLude">November 9 firing of the school&#8217;s CEO Glenn Kila and president Clarence DeLude</a>. Community members defended the work of Kila and DeLude and said the firings were a misplaced attempt at following protocols in replacing leadership in order to receive federal money. </p>

<p>Gomez referred to <a href="http://www.kitv.com/sports/25885868/detail.html" title="last week's tragic suicide of a Kahuku High School football player">last week&#8217;s tragic suicide of a Kahuku High School football player</a> in order to express how important it is for Hawaii&#8217;s students to have counseling ready and available to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re kind of upset and concerned, and because of their incompetency ... we want better leadership that&#8217;s gonna take care of our children the way we see fit to take care of our children,&#8221; Gomez said.</p>

<p>Gomez and other parents and teachers said the recent firings of Kila and DeLude has had an immediate and lasting affect on the school&#8217;s performance. The community is calling for a change in the way Kamaile Academy is overseen, including the revocation of Ho’okako’o Corporation&#8217;s charter.</p>

<p>&#8220;If [Ho’okako’o Corporation&#8217;s] so concerned about improvements at our school, why do they step in when we&#8217;re already on the right track,&#8221; said parent Michell Branigan. &#8220;Our kids are already making good improvement, awesome improvement. We&#8217;re already on our way. They come in and they block that path and they&#8217;re setting our kids back. For money.&#8221;</p>

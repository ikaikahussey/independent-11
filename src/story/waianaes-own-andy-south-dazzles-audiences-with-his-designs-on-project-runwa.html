<p>HONOLULU&#8212;His winning haute cocktail dress fashioned solely from ribbons, complete with a balloon glove accessory, got 23-year-old Waianae designer <b>Andy South</b> first place in a recent episode of <i>Project Runway</i>. Big-name designer and guest judge Betsey Johnson described his dress as “almost too beautiful.”</p>

<p>Hawaii always shows a fierce pride for any homegrown lad or lady who makes it to the big time. In South’s case, that pride grows with his representation of an Oahu area that usually doesn’t get a lot of glamorous national media coverage. And then there’s the fact that South got his design training right here on Oahu at Honolulu Community College. <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> spoke with the self-deprecating South via phone about his experience thus far. The humble, talented designer isn’t afraid to laugh, and despite being perceived as quiet, he is confident in who he is and is open to new experiences to stretch his comfort zone.</p>

<p><b>Have you seen the episodes? How do you feel about watching the portrayal of yourself?</b><br />
I think it’s very true to who I am. I’m very quiet for the most part, especially when I’m working. People who don’t know me are like, “Oh my gosh, they’re not showing you.” People who are familiar with me and my work process know I’ll have time to talk later. </p>

<p><b>What has been the most surprising to you?</b><br />
I’d have to say the timing of everything. It’s such a crunch. You really don’t realize what it is you’re doing until you see it on TV. It’s really, really strange to watch. It’s strange to watch myself on TV. And also it’s really different. We’re all there all the time. Now everyone’s watching and has their opinion. Part of my opinion feels like, “Oh my gosh, you guys weren’t even there!” </p>

<p><b>Is there anything you would have done differently?</b><br />
No, nothing other than certain design decisions, in hindsight. There comes a point when you really have to roll with what you have. That includes possibly making a few crappy choices. In that time period you don’t really have time to think. </p>

<p><b>Any interesting perceptions of Hawaii from other contestants?</b><br />
Not really. Everybody has been really amazing and positive. Everybody’s been open, too, with learning about people and each other. </p>

<p><b>Did you feel extra competitive or have an extra camaraderie with Ivy Higa, since you are both Asian and both from Hawaii?</b><br />
I think, yes, extra camaraderie with her. We both can relate to each other. We can say things that only some us can understand. </p>

<p><b>Do you plan to return to Hawaii? And do you find that New York is already influencing your design ideas?</b><br />
I am looking at relocating to New York. I feel like that’s the right career move. I’ve wanted to do it for a long time. New York’s really pushed me to think differently in a good way. To be inspired by one thing [such as Hawaii] is great. Now I can factor in New York and the city and what I’m already inspired by. It’ll put me that much more over the edge. </p>

<p><b>How was it working with Tim Gunn? That must have been exciting, although sometimes his opinions didn’t match with the judges’ opinions.</b><br />
It was great working with him. I know what you mean about when his perception is different than the judges. But I’m not one to not take his advice just because it put me in the bottom of one episode. Tim comes from a place where he understands us. He wants us to be as much as who we are as possible. The judges don’t understand us all the time. From a creative point of view, he knows us. The judges only know what is sent down the runway. </p>

<p><b>Do you have a favorite judge? Either guest or regular?</b><br />
I actually really love Norma Kamali. She always has great things to say. Even if she doesn’t like something, she always says something really positive. </p>

<p><b>What did you all do in your off time?</b><br />
We had no off time. </p>

<p><b>Do you have a dream challenge?</b><br />
I always love the unconventional challenges. Those are always my favorite. </p>

<p><b>What celebrity would you love to dress?</b><br />
I would really love to dress Victoria Beckham. I love her. As of recently, I would love to dress Rihanna. It changes with my mood. Any celebrity who isn’t afraid to take risks. Oh&#8212;Angelina Jolie would be amazing.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Has being on the show changed your main point of view on life?</b><br />
That changes everyday, too. Some days I’m a little jaded. Some days I’m a little invigorated. It comes with making that choice to do the show. You have to be prepared for everything. You may not like everything, but you have to accept it. Some days, I think, “Did I ruin my career? Did I make the worst choice of my life?” Other days I think, “This opportunity is huge. Great things are going to come from this.” </p>

<p><b>Since you are so young, have you thought about other careers you might want to pursue in the future?</b><br />
This is what I want to do.</p>

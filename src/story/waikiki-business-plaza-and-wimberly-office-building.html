<p>Today in our series on Waikiki architecture: the Waikiki Business Plaza and Wimberly Office Building.</p>

<p>The Waikiki Business Plaza was designed in 1965 by Edwin Bauer, in a style that was popularized after the Seattle World Fair of 1962. Bauer also designed St. Elizabeth’s Episcopal Church and Our Redeemer Evangelical Lutheran Church, several Waikiki hotels, including the Breakers and Hawaiiana, the American Security Bank on Liliha Street, the Continental Building at King and Kalakaua, the Niu Shopping Center, the Waikiki Business Plaza, the Oahuan Apartments and 1001 Wilder, as well as several buildings at Kaiser’s Hawaiian Village. He eventually concentrated his efforts on constructing and managing his own apartments.</p>

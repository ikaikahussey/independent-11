<p>The “pastoral” is another important topic in eco-poetics, referring to a long tradition of poetry about idealized rural life (similar forms include idylls, eclogues and bucolics). The pastoral goes back to ancient Greece, with poets like Hesiod and Theocritus, and to Rome, with Virgil, and through the literary renaissances of Italy, Britain and America. Throughout, the romantic pastoral acted as a criticism of the squalor and poverty of urban and industrial life. The pastoral encouraged a return to nature and rural life as a space of virtue, honest work, reflection, transcendence, and—even—romance. </p>

<p>Of course, anyone who has actually worked on a rural farm knows that it’s not all peaceful sheep and idyllic shepherding. Thus, a tradition of the anti-pastoral also emerged, criticizing pastoral poets for romanticizing rural life, as well as for ignoring the race, class and gender problems one might find on the farm (or plantation). These problems extend to how the rural landscape is often gendered in the pastoral as well.</p>

<p>Since modernization has removed so many from nature, many poets have imagined and fantasized what it might be like to live back on the farm, the ranch, the homestead, off the grid, etc. In class, we discussed one of the more interesting (and problematic) 20th century pastoral poems: Allen Ginsberg’s “Wales Visitation”—a Beatnik, LSD-induced, Vietnam era pastoral—which you can listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2IG1b_lzw4">here</a>.</p>

<p>Admittedly, my favorite kind of pastoral is the “necro-pastoral.” “Necro” comes from the Greek nekros, meaning death or corpse. Imagine a landscape filled with dead bodies, enslaved bodies, diseased bodies, mutilated bodies, worms, rats, cockroaches, rabid animals, decaying trees, polluted rivers, smog, rotting food, ruins and blazing wildfires. This, too, has a long, changing tradition. Think certain scary fairy tales, the Book of Revelation, Dante’s circles of hell, the Gothic, vampires, zombies, apocalypse stories, Halloween, Bansky’s Dismaland etc. The necro-pastoral aims to make us look at death, sin, evil, fear and destruction so that we might consider our mortality, morality and ethics. Sometimes fear wakes us up more than romance. Like the pastoral, the necro-pastoral has its own problematic relation to race, class, and gender. </p>

<p>In terms of eco-poetics, the death and destruction caused by climate change has brought the necro-pastoral to the forefront of our imaginations. We are now surrounded by so many images and stories of the necro-pastoral—from the Tar Sands to industrial slaughter houses, from raging wildfires in California to massive chemical explosions in China, from the mass die-offs of fish washing ashore on Pacific coasts to the mass migrations of refugees to the shores of Europe. Collapse and catastrophe flood the stream of all our media.</p>

<p>Speaking of floods, Hawaii has experienced quite a few these last few weeks with the onslaught of a series of hurricanes. With all the rainfall, the streets of Waikiki were recently flooded with more than 500,000 gallons of raw sewage. Waikiki, often cast as a literary site of the Pacific necro-pastoral, was shut down. </p>

<p>So we decided to write poems about Waikiki, sewage and shit. We watched a <a href="https://archive.org/details/TakingWaikiki">short documentary about Waikiki</a>, read <a href="http://fluxhawaii.com/you-dont-know-shit/">an article</a> titled “You Don’t Know Shit: Tracing doodoo on the islands from ancient times to apocalyptic futures,” and a poem called “Waikiki,” by Haunani-Kay Trask, which begins:</p>

<p>all those 5 gallon<br />
toilets &nbsp;  &nbsp; flushing<br />
away tourist waste<br />
into our waters</p>

<p>Waikīkī&nbsp;   home<br />
of aliʻi<br />
sewer center <br />
of Hawaiʻi</p>

<p>With all this in mind, please check out the student poems below (8 in all, about 30 minutes of reading time). Feel free to comment or to write your own shitty poems in response. </p>

<p>Note: </p>

<p><strong>Liberty Dialysis: A Sympathetic Fallacy</strong><br />
Chase Wiggins</p>

<p>Conversation One:<br />
So you’re kidneys aren’t functioning properly.<br />
Do you understand what this means for your body?</p>

<p>Well&#8230; I guess it means I gotta start dialysis&#8230;</p>

<p>Yes. It means your kidneys can no longer filter enough waste<br />
Out of your blood stream, so we’ll do it artificially.<br />
That’s dialysis.</p>

<p>Do you know why your kidneys have failed you?<br />
Do you have any ideas about how you got to need dialysis?</p>

<p>Well… I’m old, for one thing&#8230; </p>

<p>Sure, but do you have high blood pressure?<br />
Over-development?<br />
Diabetes?<br />
An influx of tourists, maybe?</p>

<p>Yeah yeah, I get all those things.<br />
But I still figgah it’s most old age, eh?</p>

<p>Hmph. I see you’re on both Medicare and Medicaid.<br />
Is that due to disability or retirement?</p>

<p>I’m 87 years old. I retired 30 years ago.<br />
So I get Medicare, Medicaid, Foreign Investors,<br />
Film Tax Credits, Tourism Revenue, One beautification fund&#8230;<br />
Yeah, I get all kine “financial incentives.”</p>

<p>Yes. Well. To make things easier, a vascular surgeon<br />
Has fused a major vein with a major artery in your arm. <br />
It broke, but we want to strengthen the fistula and use it ASAP.<br />
This will be hard, but forming coalitions will help. </p>

<p>Conversation Two:<br />
To help your kidneys through dialysis,<br />
We highly suggest that you follow a renal diet: </p>

<p>On a renal diet you’ll have to avoid salt.<br />
A young tourist cries into his shave ice,<br />
Because the beach is closed and he doesn’t understand<br />
Why it had to happen on his Hawaiian vacation.<br />
 <br />
On a renal diet you’ll have to avoid rich foods.<br />
A young family suffers because they cannot afford<br />
Any of these affordable new developments,<br />
And the streets are literally turning to shit.</p>

<p>On a renal diet you can’t eat too many nuts.<br />
A young woman wanders around looking sun-dazed,<br />
Stops every so often to dig in the sand and plant a seed.<br />
Shoppers walking by shake their head at another crazy local.</p>

<p>On a renal diet you can’t drink too much water.<br />
Beware of days with heavy rain:<br />
The Ala Wai is going septic too,<br />
And there’s no telling how much more it can take.</p>

<p>Later, my Papa would tell me it was really all his fault:<br />
Yeah, I knew about the diabetes. Too much sugar…<br />
But I never really watched what I ate.<br />
For a while, though, everything was so sweet. </p>



<p><strong>Fertilizing an Island</strong><br />
Eileen Nalley</p>

<p>Standing at the base of the Koʻolau<br />
one gets a rare kind of view </p>

<p>A watershed opens up <br />
offering a glimpse of the seaward journey<br />
of rain drops mauka to makai</p>

<p>Anciently heavy skies would wash <br />
the strength of million year old mountains<br />
into abundant kaukau<br />
fortifying gentle spirits</p>

<p>But over time fertile fields swelled with<br />
the foul filth of foreign minds<br />
that refused to mālama ʻāina</p>

<p>These men insatiably sewed selfishness<br />
into soils rich with lokomaikaʻi<br />
where the seeds firmly rooted and prospered</p>

<p>Mirrored buildings grew tall and ripe<br />
on land that had been <br />
primed by the Great Māhele</p>

<p>And each new fruit and blossom borne<br />
forced one field of kānaka maoli<br />
wisdom to lie fallow </p>

<p>In the place of civilization,<br />
the industrial waste containers<br />
overflowing with ʻōpala from cradle to grave<br />
reflect back all that was lost<br />
in the vast kai </p>

<p>And in this graveyard<br />
for fields of tradition <br />
the kaʻekaʻe now flows freely</p>

<p>The mana of kingdoms<br />
once passed through rich soil  <br />
to power of aloha in the hearts of a nation</p>

<p>But like chief Halaʻea, poisoned by greed <br />
this regenerative force<br />
now chokes the life out of its creators </p>

<p>In the distance the peaks still whisper of times <br />
when pono prevailed </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Waikiki</strong><br />
Elan Stopnitzky</p>

<p>waikiki courses<br />
with arteries<br />
of putrefaction</p>

<p>her fish<br />
look irradiated</p>

<p>they gaze up at<br />
the skyline<br />
through the black tea<br />
of the ala wai</p>

<p>indifferent to their<br />
own incomprehension</p>

<p>I feel the same, wondering<br />
what part of our spirit<br />
had to be dredged<br />
to accept this<br />
as civilization?</p>

<p>Or maybe I<br />
just can&#8217;t tell<br />
they are really thriving<br />
tourists afforded the privilege<br />
of swimming these<br />
dead waters</p>

<p>the excrement<br />
inundating the streets and streams<br />
a display of abundance</p>

<p>if you hold your nose </p>

<p><strong>After a Sewage Spill in Waikiki</strong><br />
Henry Wei Leung</p>

<p>The subject is the sea.</p>

<p>Like any sentence,<br />
like any human,<br />
it desires to be whole.</p>

<p>The subject is the sea<br />
which rises.</p>

<p>At its base,<br />
bodies persist,<br />
tanning, while towels <br />
smother faces.<br />
We are all bodies of waste.</p>

<p>Rhapsodies of filth.</p>

<p>The subject is a crust which also rises, <br />
a crown and a survival,<br />
an old eruption <br />
now growing green.</p>

<p>Just valleys of rain.</p>

<p>Some of us spill our remains<br />
where we know we do not belong.</p>

<p>Silent evacuations. A carving<br />
on the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>The subject rises<br />
and is plural<br />
but this plurality is an illusion</p>

<p>of the English language<br />
which arrived <br />
by taking from other languages.</p>

<p><strong>How to Profit from Your Native Land</strong><br />
Jessie Lathrop</p>

<p>Come ashore and notice the sustainably irrigated earth<br />
The sustainably irrigated people<br />
The vibrant fishponds and lush taro and tall, tall palms<br />
Bring disease with you as you disembark<br />
You’ll want to give that to the locals<br />
Trade it for their land<br />
Then round them up for not having said land<br />
Put them to work, put them in jail, put them in missions<br />
Rope God into what you’re doing</p>

<p>Erect resorts where marshlands were<br />
Remark on the quaintness of the place<br />
Make some sugar<br />
Get your home country involved<br />
Make railroads for said sugar<br />
Demand better roads</p>

<p>Always take more than you give<br />
Gather your friends and infiltrate the government <br />
(Write laws that hand out disadvantage <br />
Like your country does you currency)<br />
Overthrow it<br />
Today Hawai‘i, tomorrow the world</p>

<p><strong>Waikiki Backlog Blues</strong><br />
Darlene Rodrigues</p>

<p>beach water backwash<br />
land regurgitates the jetsam flotsam of urban life<br />
the earthʻs ocean boils causing boils<br />
 <br />
blackwater backwater <br />
land deals <br />
shameless <br />
unhidden<br />
contract for hire <br />
to unearth the earthed</p>

<p>waikiki <br />
backed up<br />
and<br />
jacked up</p>

<p>backlog<br />
there was a log kept once<br />
with tick marks and initials<br />
a “flow” to communication</p>

<p>full stop<br />
rip off <br />

shits top<br />
shit stops here</p>

<p>the buck stopped way way way over

<p><strong>Too Much Mana</strong><br />
Brian Lieu</p>

<p>Are we moving<br />

Why take the land, so-<br />

Why take our man-<br />

you even know <br />
what’s buried do-<br />
wn there, he-<br />

If you knew, you’d<br />
know it’s shit—to-<br />
tal crap. Bullshit per-<br />

Our lands go-<br />

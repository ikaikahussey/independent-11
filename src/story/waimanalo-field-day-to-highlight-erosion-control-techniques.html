<p>The public is invited to attend a free field day highlighting erosion control materials that help farmers and land managers reduce erosion and protect good water quality.&nbsp; The field day is scheduled for Thursday April 15, 2010 from 10:00am to 12:00pm at Glad&#8217;s Landscaping, 41-830 Mahiku Place in Waimanalo. </p>

<p>Experts will discuss the use of compost filter socks, geotextile materials, mulch, native plants and vetiver grass to stabilize slopes and stream banks.&nbsp; Attention will be given to nursery operations, and simple steps that can be taken to minimize movement of soil from stockpiles and landscaping sites. </p>

<p>Representatives from the Soil and Water Conservation District will be on hand to explain Conservation Plans and the benefits to farmers who become cooperators of the Conservation District, and representatives from the State Department of Health will be available to discuss the importance of sediment reduction and the protection of Hawaii&#8217;s streams.</p>

<p>Presentations will include information on financial assistance available to farmers to install conservation practices.&nbsp; The USDA- Natural Resources Conservation Service offers financial assistance through its Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the Oahu Resource Conservation and Development Council has grant funds available to farmers operating in the Waimanalo watershed. </p>

<p>The field day is sponsored by the Oahu Resource Conservation and Development Council, a non-profit organization that encourages conservation of our natural, cultural and economic resources.&nbsp; Additional support for the field day comes from Glad&#8217;s Landscaping and Tree Trimming, Hawaii Department of Health&#8212;Clean Water Branch, USDA&#8212;Natural Resources Conservation Service, Windward Oahu Soil and Water Conservation District, Envirotech Biosolutions, Hawaiian Earth Products, Hui Ku Maoli Ola, J.P.

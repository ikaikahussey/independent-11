<p>WAIANAE&#8212;The Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill (WGSL) and all City refuse facilities are open to the public and back to normal operations.</p>

<p>All six convenience centers&#8212;Ewa, Laie, Wahiawa, Waianae, Waimanalo and Waipahu&#8212;along with the Kapaa, Kawailoa and Keehi transfer stations have lifted all previous restrictions while the landfill was unavailable.</p>

<p>Waste Management Hawaii, who operates and maintains the landfill for the City, received both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state Department of Health approvals after completing repairs. </p>

<p>The landfill experienced three major rainstorm events from December 19, 2010, through January 13, 2011. The last event flooded the active waste cell, dislodging trash and debris into the ocean. </p>

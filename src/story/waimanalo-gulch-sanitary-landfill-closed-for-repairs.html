<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Waimanalo Gulch Sanitary Landfill (WGSL) will remain closed to all haulers until at least January 27, and the City will continue its revised bulky item collection schedule picking up only metal appliances next week.</p>

<p>Waste Management of Hawaii, the operator of WGSL, has assessed its cell liner and determined it will require repairs before it is able to safely accept waste again.</p>

<p>For bulky item collection, City crews cannot pick up carpets, chairs, sofas, mattresses, box springs, toilets and home renovation debris. Residents are asked to hold these items on their properties and do not place them curbside until further notice. Metal appliances that can be collected include refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers, water heaters, and ranges.</p>

<p>The areas scheduled for bulky item service the week of January 24 to 28, the fourth Monday and fourth Wednesday of the month, are as follows:</p>

<p><b>Wednesday, January 26:</b>&nbsp; Niu Valley, Kuliouou, Hahaione Valley, Hawaii Kai, Mariner&#8217;s Ridge, Portlock, Kalama Valley, and Queen&#8217;s Gate. From Hawaii Loa St. to Kalama Valley.&nbsp; Aiea, Halawa and Makalapa.&nbsp; Kailua (Maunawili, Old Kalanianaole Rd.), Waimanalo. </p>

<p>The City asks for the public’s assistance by placing the acceptable items curbside no earlier than the evening before or by 6:00 a.m. on the day of the scheduled pickup. Do not block sidewalks, driveways or roadways. The acceptable items will be collected over a 3-to-4 day period.</p>

<p>The City’s Refuse Division will continue its regular manual and automated trash collection island-wide from the gray, green waste, and blue recycling bins.</p>

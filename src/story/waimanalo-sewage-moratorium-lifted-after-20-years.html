<p>WAIMANALO&#8212;The City and County of <a href="http://envhonolulu.org/" target="_blank">Honolulu’s Department of Environmental Service</a>s announced today it has lifted a moratorium on new sewer connections in the Waimanalo Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) service area.</p>

<p>The moratorium has been in place since November 26, 1991, from Makapu‘u Point to Bellows Air Force Station, making up the Waimanalo WWTP service area.</p>

<p>The plant, built in 1968, is owned by the State <a href="http://hawaii.gov/dlnr" target="_blank">Department of Land and Natural Resources</a>, but has been operated by the City since its inception.&nbsp; The State is in the process of finalizing documents to turn the plant over to the City. The plant was able to process 800,000 gallons a day before the State spent $21 million in upgrades, including expanding capacity to 1.1 million gallons a day.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Currently, the Waimanalo WWTP processes about 600,000 gallons of sewage per day to a secondary treatment level, using 10 underground injection wells approximately 200 feet deep. </p>

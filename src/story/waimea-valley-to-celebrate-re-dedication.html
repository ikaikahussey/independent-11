<p>WAIMEA VALLEY&#8212;<a href="http://www.waimeavalley.net/default.aspx" target="_blank">Waimea Valley</a> will celebrate its re-dedication with Pulama O Waimea, an annual event that provides family fun, guided walks, a kalo workshop, arts and crafts, a plant sale, food, and entertainment. The event will feature a kanikapila, or backyard-style musical jam. Musicians of all skill levels are invited to participate.</p>

<p>The Kalo Workshop brings experts, farmers and community members together to learn and share all about Kalo.&nbsp; The workshop is interactive with special guest speakers, breakout sessions and walking tours to the kalo gardens.&nbsp; The Waimea Valley Kalo Workshop is free and open to all interested individual and groups.</p>

<p>Waimea Valley was acquired by the <a href="http://www.oha.org/"="_blank" target>Office of Hawaiian Affairs</a> in August, 2006, in partnership with the City and County, the United States Army, the <a href="http://www.tpl.org/" target="_blank">Trust for Public Land</a>, and the Department of Land and Natural Resources.</p>

<p>Light refreshments will be available at the kalo workshop  registration. You can bring lunch or purchase something delicious at Nā Mea Ono. To register or for more information, please contact Jennifer Yagodich at (808) 638-5859 or jyagodich@waimeavalley.net.</p>

<p>WAIPAHU&#8212;The two northbound lanes on Waipahu Depot Street will be closed 24-hours a day, for five consecutive days from Monday, December 13, through Friday, December 17, due to roadway construction work.</p>

<p>This project involves construction of a concrete bus pad between Hikimoe Street and Farrington Highway, and reconstruction of the sidewalk adjacent to Hawaii Federal Credit Union across from Shiroâ€™s Drive Inn.</p>

<p>Waipahu Depot Street northbound and southbound traffic lanes will be temporarily shifted to the other side of the street from Hikimoe Street to Farrington Highway. The construction follows similar work that required temporary closure of southbound lanes this week. Police officers are directing traffic at both ends of the construction work area. Motorists are advised to use caution in this area.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>During the roadway construction, motorists are encouraged to avoid Waipahu Depot Street if possible. Motorists who normally use Waipahu Depot Street to get to the Waipahu Transit Center are encouraged to take alternative routes. Mokuola Street is a suggested alternative.</p>

<p>Bus patrons normally using the Waipahu Depot Street bus stop northbound just before Hikimoe Street are asked to use the transit center bus stops.</p>

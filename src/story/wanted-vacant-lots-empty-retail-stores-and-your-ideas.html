<p>Aloha readers:</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your suggestions on what should go in some of Hawaii&#8217;s vacant storefronts and empty lots, like King&#8217;s Court or the old Chinese restaurant on Houghtailing and School streets. We&#8217;re looking for more vacant spots to feature in &#8220;<a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/places/whatshouldgohere">What Should Go Here</a>&#8221;! Please recommend places to feature by leaving us a comment below, or emailing us at <a href="mailto:news@hawaiiindependent.net">news@hawaiiindependent.net</a>. Mahalo!</p>

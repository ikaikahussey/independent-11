<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The Department of Environmental Services (ENV) will soon smoke test the wastewater collection system in the Aliamanu and Kuliouou areas. Testing will be conducted from September 13 to 16 in Aliamanu and from September 27 to October 5 in Kuliouou.</p>

<p>The testing is part of ENVâ€™s preventative maintenance program to prevent rainwater from entering the sewer system. ENV crews pump smoke into sewer lines, examine whether any smoke escapes and record its location. The smoke used is non-toxic, harmless, and has minimal odor. The smoke is not a fire <br />
hazard or health hazard to humans or pets.</p>

<p>Tests locate broken pipes, illegal connections, open cleanouts and other paths for runoff to enter the sewer system. Runoff from heavy rain can overwhelm and surcharge the sewer system and treatment plants, causing sewer overflows.</p>

<p>In Aliamanu, ENV will smoke-test streets stretching from Ala Puumalu Community Park to the Likini Street Mini Park. In Kuliouou, crews will smoke-test all streets from Paiko Drive to Maunalua Avenue (west to east) and north past Kuliouou Neighborhood Park to the end of Kalaau Place.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City’s Department of Environmental Services (ENV) responded today to a force main spill near the Kahala Wastewater Pump Station. The call came in at 10:34 a.m. ENV arrived at 11:15 a.m. and secured the site at 4:45 p.m.</p>

<p>The 24-inch force main percolated approximately 30,100 gallons of untreated wastewater up from the ground at 4929 Kahala Avenue. Vactor trucks were able to recover 30,000 gallons with the remaining 100 dissipating into the ground. </p>

<p>When the spill was reported, the flow was diverted from the 24-inch to the 18-inch backup force main. A contractor will be repairing the 24-inch pipe.&nbsp; The cause of the spill is under investigation.</p>

<p>ENV cleaned, disinfected, and deodorized the area. The State Department of Health was notified and waived signing and sampling. No wastewater reached receiving water.</p>

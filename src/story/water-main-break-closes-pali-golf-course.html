<p>KAILUA&#8212;The City&#8217;s<a href="http://www1.honolulu.gov/des/golf/pali.htm" target="_blank"> Pali Golf Course </a>has been temporarily closed due to a water main break in Kaneohe that has disrupted water service to the course.</p>

<p>The course will reopen when water service is restored. Golfers already on the course will be allowed to complete their round, and water coolers will be available for them.</p>

<p>Board of Water Supply crews have isolated the water main break and expect repair work to continue through the evening.</p>

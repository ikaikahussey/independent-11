Chairwoman Representative Mele Carroll (D-13th) called for the House Committee on Hawaiian Affairs to convene to hear testimony and vote on a number of measures. The persons who submitted testimony ranged from envoys from the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) to private citizens. Due to time constraints related to the quantity of bills discussed and the number of testifiers, some of the bills will be voted on next week.<br />
<br />
The first item was <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=2903" title="SB 2903">SB 2903</a>, a Senate bill that would require the Department of Education, the charter school administrative office, and the Hawaiian Language College at UH-Hilo to enter into an agreement regarding the Hawaiian language college's functions related to Nawahiokalani`opu`u school and other lab schools. Rep. Faye Hanohano (D-4th) testified in favor of this bill, as did Dr. Kalena Silva from the College of Hawaiian Language.  Maunalei Love, Interim Executive Director of the Charter School Administration Offices, raised concerns regarding the degree of responsibility that will be afforded to the Hawaiian Language College. The Committee voted to pass this bill with amendments to address the concerns that Love raised.<br />
<br />
The second item was <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=SB&billnumber=633" title="SB 633">SB 633</a>, which would increase the representation of homestead farmers on the Molokai irrigations system users' advisory board. Dwayne Okamoto of the Department of Agriculture, stated that they wanted community input from kupuna homesteaders. He also noted the current policies undertaken to ensure that Hawaiian homesteaders have priority use of the water; for example, during times of drought, businesses are required to cut back on their water use whereas homesteaders are allowed to use water as they are accustomed to. <br />
<br />
Carroll asked how the Department of Agriculture defined kupuna for the purpose of the bill and voiced concerns that not all kupuna homesteaders are necessarily farmers, and that while their knowledge is not to be undervalued, some of the younger homesteaders might be more educated regarding technical advances in water conservation. Sovereign Council of Hawaiian Homestead Associations (SCHHA) chairman Kamaki Kanahele concurred, stating that he felt all water users should be consulted on this measure. He testified that Moku Aupuni o Molokai represents all homesteaders. Therefore, Carroll recommended amendments to the bill providing that Moku Aupuni O Molokai determine the process by which they will select their representative for this position on the advisory board. The Committee voted to pass this amended version of the bill.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HCR&billnumber=103" title="HCR 103">HCR 103</a> and <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HR&billnumber=54" title="HR 54">HR 54</a> both urge participation in the 6th Healing Our Spirit Worldwide Gathering, an event that occurs every 4 years and encourages indigenous communities to join together in spiritual, emotional, and physical healing. Leimomi Khan, president of the Hawaiian Civics Club, testified in support of the resolutions, as did Papa Ola Lokahi.  Both of these organizations are involved in hosting the gatherings in Honolulu this September. The Committee voted to pass this resolution with amendments.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HCR&billnumber=244" title="HCR 244">HCR 244</a> and <a href="http://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2010/lists/measure_indiv.aspx?billtype=HR&billnumber=172" title="HR 172">HR 172</a> request that a lo`i be established on the grounds of the State Capitol. The Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) cited reservations, questioning how a lo`i would impact the Capitol's nomination to the National Registry of Historic places and it did not possess "sufficient personnel or funding to implement growing kalo on the Capitol grounds as envisioned by these resolutions. Private citizen Daniel Anthony testified that an organization he belongs to, Onipa`a Na Hui Kalo, "does laulima work days to open taro patches all over the islands" and stated that he envisioned the lo`i as a community project that wouldn't require funding so much as it would volunteers. The Committee voted to pass this measure with amendments to add the Office of Hawaiian Affairs as the state agency responsible for overseeing and initiating planning with all kalo farmers to realize this vision.

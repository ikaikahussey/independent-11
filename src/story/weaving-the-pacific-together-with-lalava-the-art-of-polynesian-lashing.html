<p>Fakataha Pasifika (weaving Pasifika together) is a 3-week celebration of the connections between Tonga, Hawaii, and the islands of the Pacific through explorations&#8212;led by Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi&#8212;into the ancient art of lalava and its modern expressions.</p>

<p>Sponsored by Pasifika Foundation Hawaii, the UH-Manoa Center for Pacific Island Studies, and Intersections (UH-Manoa Deptartment of Art and Art History), Fakataha Pasifika will offer opportunities for students and community members to learn more about lalava, the traditional Pacific Island art form of lashing that was used to join and bind materials together.</p>

<p>Tongan-born Sopolemamalma Filipe Tohi of Aotearoa (New Zealand), the world-renowed artist known for his mastery of the ancient Tongan art of lalava and his artistic and cultural interpretations of that art form, is firmly established as one of the leading contemporary Pacific visual artists. Working across a range of media, including stone, wood, steel, and digital imagery, he seeks to expand upon and delve deeper into the mysteries of the art of lalava. His work transforms this technology of the past into modern representations of identity and experience.</p>

<p>Tohi has dedicated the last 20 years of his life to studying the intricate, complex design patterns of these lashings, which create a cultural language hidden within the layers upon layers of black and brown coconut sennit wrapped around the beams of fales and sailing canoes. &#8220;Lalava was our computer,&#8221; Tohi says. &#8220;Knowledge about astronomy and navigation, mathematics and physics, the environment and history is all recorded here, within the patterns of the lalava.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Fakataha Pasifika series of lectures, presentations and workshops, Tohi demonstrates how these geometric patterns, formed by the layers of wrapped coconut sennit, were a well-established part of daily life, and he describes how the lalava patterns were a mnemonic device for representing a life philosophy. Lalava patterns, says Tohi, advocated balance in daily living and were metaphorical and physical ties to cultural knowledge.</p>

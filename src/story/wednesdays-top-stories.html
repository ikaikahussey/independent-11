<p>Two state House committees sent a bill that would legalize gay marriage to the full chamber Tuesday night, ending a five-day public hearing that exposed deep divisions in Hawaii on an issue being considered across the United States. Members of the House Judiciary and Finance committees voted for the bill after hearing more than 55 hours of public testimony, leading to alterations in the measure. <a href="http://westhawaiitoday.com/sections/news/state-wire/house-committees-forward-gay-marriage-bill.html">Associated Press.</a></p>

<p>The state House is preparing to take a critical procedural vote today on a bill that would allow same-sex couples to marry but would expand a religious exemption. Several lawmakers are expected to push for amendments that would broaden the religious exemption even further, which, if successful, could put the House version of the bill in sharp conflict with the Senate&#8217;s and possibly prolong the legislative special session. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131106__FULL_HOUSE_TO_CAST_KEY_VOTE.html?id=230780351">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>Same-sex marriage legislation finally cleared another major hurdle. Despite 55-plus hours of oral testimony, most of it weighted heavily in opposition, two Hawaii House committees passed Senate Bill 1 Tuesday by a comfortable margin. The Judiciary Committee passed the bill 8-5. The Finance Committee passed it 10-7. <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/articles/2013/11/05/20335-hawaiis-same-sex-marriage-bill-finally-advances-in-the-house/">Civil Beat.</a></p>

<p>A controversial same-sex marriage bill has passed a joint House committee and will advance to the House floor for a second reading and vote Wednesday morning. SB 1, the &#8220;Hawai&#8217;i Marriage Equality Act of 2013&#8221; passed 18 - 12 Tuesday afternoon. The biggest change in this amended version is the expanded exemption that will apply to both non-profit and for-profit religious organizations&#8212;protecting them from fine or penalty if they refuse to perform a wedding ceremony for same-sex couples. <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/23887893/watch-at-5-house-committees-pass-same-sex-marriage-bill-advances-to-floor-for-vote">Hawaii News Now.</a></p>

<p>The head of Hawaii&#8217;s police officers union said he is standing by his opposition to the same-sex marriage bill and other comments he made before a legislative committee Monday despite the charge by a gay Honolulu police officer who said the actions cast a shadow over the Police Department&#8217;s integrity when dealing with the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131106__Police_union_leader_criticized_for_saying_he_wont_honor_law.html?id=230777231">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

<p>&#8220;You would have to kill me.&#8221; Any way you slice it, it&#8217;s a dramatic, provocative statement. So it&#8217;s easy to see why those six words — spoken by police union President Tenari Maafala during marathon hearings on same-sex marriage — resonated with <a href="http://www.civilbeat.com/posts/2013/11/06/20337-gene-park-when-the-words-you-would-have-to-kill-me-go-national/">Civil Beat.</a></p>

<p>Holding his bible, SHOPO President Tenari Ma&#8217;afala testifies against SB1, the same-sex marriage bill.&nbsp; He told lawmakers this bill will turn him, a law abiding citizen, into a law breaker.

<p>The contractor responsible for the troubled Hawaii Health Connector website is the same company the state hired 14 years ago to build a tax collection system that state officials say has never worked properly. Canadian-based CGI Group Inc. was paid $87.5 million between 1999 and 2011 to modernize the Hawaii Department of Taxation&#8217;s collection system. Because of flaws in the system CGI built, the state is preparing to spend at least another $32 million to redo the project, Tax Department officials said. <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/newspremium/20131106_Persistent_problems__plague_tax_collection_system_.html?id=230780341">Star-Advertiser.</a></p>

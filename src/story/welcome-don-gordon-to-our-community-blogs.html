<p>I&#8217;m really happy to welcome Don Gordon, jazz DJ on <a href="http://http://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/">Hawaii Public Radio</a>, who is writing a new <a href="http://thehawaiiindependent.com/blogs/dongordon/">community blog</a> here on the Independent. He&#8217;s got a great show – playing right now – so check out his words. </p>

<p>And if you have community information that you&#8217;d like to share via a blog, let me <a href="mailto:publisher@thehawaiiindependent.com">know</a>.</p>

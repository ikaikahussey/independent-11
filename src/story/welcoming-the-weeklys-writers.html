<p>You&#8217;ll notice some new voices in the Independent. Edward Hickman contributed the interview with <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/stop-listen-and-think">Damian Marley</a>, and Wayne Coito invited us to the dance floor for some <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/keep-your-eyes-on-the-hips">summer salsa</a>. Both Edward and Wayne were contributing writers to the former Honolulu Weekly â€“ please join me in welcoming them to the Independent. Over the next few weeks, you&#8217;ll see more of your favorite Weekly writers in our pages here. (And thanks to Will Caron for helping to edit these pieces.)</p>

<p>Also, mahalo to Jordan Aikau and Ariana Ursua, who completed the first week of their summer internship with us. Thank you for your hard work! And thanks everyone for reading and sharing the Hawaii Independent.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve worked hard in the past week to push through a series of upgrades to the <i>Hawaii Independent&#8217;s</i> website. Many of the changes have been on the backend&#8212;we&#8217;ve moved to a new server to accomodate increaed traffic, and we&#8217;ve changed our templates to make it easier for our reporters to allocate stories across our 17 community and beat pages.</p>

<p>As a consequence of these changes, we&#8217;ve experienced some technical difficulties. We apologize for the dust, and we thank you for your help in finding broken links or missing stylesheets. (I&#8217;m talking to you, @hawaii! Mahalo.)</p>

<p>A lot of the changes that we&#8217;re making are motivated by the realization that not only are we living in a one-paper town, it&#8217;s a state of outsider media monopolies. As a result, good reporters have lost their jobs, small businesses are being hit by hiked-up ad rates, and the quality and quantity of local news have been affected.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve decided that the best thing we can do for the community, right now, is to dramatically grow our breadth and reportage so that we can compete with the new <i>Star-Advertiser,</i> and thus offer our readers and Hawaii&#8217;s small businesses a viable alternative. So in addition to our normal hyperlocal community coverage, we&#8217;re starting to present more breaking news, and regular coverage of local politics and economy. If we can&#8217;t cover a story with our own reporters, we&#8217;ll link to others who can&#8212;<i>including the Star-Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>We&#8217;re very interested in hiring former <i>Honolulu Advertiser</i> writers, but we&#8217;ve been stymied by restrictive severance arrangements which are preventing those highly-experienced writers from seeking other employment until July.</p>

<p>On the horizon, as well, is the best coverage of the political campaign season, on The Rotunda. We&#8217;ve got the voices of the campaigns themselves via their Twitter feeds. And soon, we&#8217;ll launch an open source database of local politics, which we&#8217;re tentatively calling &#8220;Political Intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s some other goodies, too, such as a social-life section called HI24/7. You can think of it as Metromix for the whole local experience, night and day. And we&#8217;re planning to add more membership functionality, which is an area on which we&#8217;ve moved too-slowly.</p>

<p>So thanks everyone for your patience and support. We&#8217;ve seen dramatic increases in pageviews and visitors since Monday, and are gratified by your readership. We welcome your feedback! Let us know how we can improve.</p>

<p>Mahalo for supporting local journalism.</p>

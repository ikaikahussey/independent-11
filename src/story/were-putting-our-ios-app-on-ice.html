<p>Aloha kakou:</p>

<p>We&#8217;re putting our iOS app on ice. Several factors influenced this decision: the Newsstand platform, upon which the app is built, is less useful under iOS 7; posting to the app increases the burden on staff; the app isn&#8217;t available for non-iOS users; and our website is already a pretty good platform for reading.</p>

<p>Popular recurring app content, such as Polyfantastica, will be migrated over to a new product, due out soon.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns or questions, please email me. We&#8217;re also happy to issue refunds for the past couple of issues which didn&#8217;t make it out while we contemplated this decision. <a href="mailto:publisher@hawaiiindependent.net">Please get in touch</a>.</p>

<p>What happens to other city services when rail is in operation and transit grow from 10% now, to 19% of the city budget?&nbsp; Which services must be reduced or what taxes must be raised?</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the central question for a forum sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Honolulu on Saturday, June 29 at 10 am at Washington Middle School, King St. at Punahou. Panelists will include Ann Kobayashi, chair of city council budget committee; Matthew Lynch who heads the effort to remake Kamalii park; Natalie Iwasa, CPA and city council activist; and Richard Ubersax, a project analyst. The forum is open to the public.</p>

<p>Vincent says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The influence of radical ideas, events and people may not always seem apparent in our daily lives. I was originally inspired by to the art of the composite drawing and the act of one person interpreting another person&#8217;s interpretation to describe someone or something they witnessed. I believe somewhere between our normal everyday experience, our hopes, dreams and beliefs exists the radical.</p>

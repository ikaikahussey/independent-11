<p><strong class="question">Tell us about your favorite Barter Bar transaction.</strong></p>

<p>My favorite barter transaction thus far was a box of veggies (already eaten so no photo available unfortuantely) traded for my graphic design services. My second favorite transaction was a Fresh Cafe gift card traded for my graphic design services.&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong class="question">What do you like about the Barter Bar experience? Why should others go?</strong></p>

<p>I relish the communal aspect Fresh Cafe is pioneering; I enjoy networking at Barter Bar and the event space is very welcoming and conducive to mingling; and I love finding new people to collaborate with (or just have a conversation with to learn about what is going on in the community). I would encourage others to go to Barter Bar if they want any of the things just mentioned, or if nothing else then to see first-hand what trade looks like in-person, which will in turn open their minds to ways of exchange that don&#8217;t involve money.</p>

<p><em>Barter Bar is every Third Thursday at Fresh Cafe. For more information, visit <a href="http://barterbarhi.com">the website</a>.</em></p>

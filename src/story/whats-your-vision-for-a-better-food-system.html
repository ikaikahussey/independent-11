<p>In June, <i>The Hawaii Independent</i> will be publishing a series of articles on food: the facts of what we eat, what we grow, and what we import; the new movement of young, local farmers; the contentious questions of genetically-modified organisms; and the burgeoning local restaurant scene.</p>

<p>In preparation for this coverage, we&#8217;d like your response to a question:</p>

<div class="pull-black">What&#8217;s your vision for a better food system?</div>

<p><br />
<b>For example:</b><br />
- Should there be more local farms? More community gardens?<br />
- What kinds of crops should we be producing?<br />
- GMO, or no?<br />
- How&#8217;s our restaurant scene? Are there specific kinds of restaurants that you&#8217;d like to have established?</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll use your responses to influence our coverage, and we may mention your name and ideas. Thanks very much for your participation.</p>

<p><i>Please leave your responses in the comments below, or email news@thehawaiiindependent.com with the title &#8220;The Question.&#8221;</i></p>

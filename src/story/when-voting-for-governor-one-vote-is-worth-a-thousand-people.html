<p>We tend to think of the Governor as a man (too often than not). That&#8217;s about 1/1000 of the story.</p>

<p>Hawaii&#8217;s governor is an incredibly powerful office, able to appoint more than 1,000 people to important executive offices, boards, and commissions.</p>

<p>For starters, there&#8217;s the <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/office-of-the-governor/">Office of the Governor</a>. This is the core staff that executes the Governor&#8217;s initiatives and policies. Under Abercrombie it&#8217;s 42 individuals, including chief of staff Bruce Coppa, a former PRP official; and Marvin Wong, &#8220;Special Assistant to the Governor,&#8221; whose ambiguous responsibilities and deep ties to the construction industry have led to him being described as the Governor&#8217;s connection to Hawaii&#8217;s actual power politics.</p>

<p>Another 45 individuals sit on the Governor&#8217;s Cabinet, comprising the directors and deputies of the state agencies and offices. </p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s another <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Rosters-2012.pdf">1,000 individuals</a> who serve on state boards and commissions. With few exceptions – the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and precious else – these are all appointed by the Governor, and confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to praise or criticize Abercrombie&#8217;s picks for these positions – particularly the rightward movement in appointments since he took office – because he&#8217;s the incumbent. It&#8217;s not clear who Ige would appoint, and his campaign ought to make that public and transparent. Because the fact is that the Governor is the head of a vast bureaucracy, the majority of whose work will be done by a thousand other people.</p>

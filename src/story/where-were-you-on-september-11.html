<p>&#8220;After 9-11, American citizens came together in support of each other and of the country, just as they did following Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>In 2001, President George W. Bush capitalized on this and took us to war to defeat the enemy, and he also told us the way to get the country back on track was to go out and &#8220;shop.&#8221; We now see we took on the wrong enemy, and though I understand that &#8220;shopping&#8221; helps provide jobs by boosting the economy, in retrospect, this idea to &#8220;self-indulge&#8221; our way out of trouble has proven to be terribly misguided.</p>

<p>We now have an economy that is still trying to right itself after many years of Wall Street greed (self-indulgence, banker-style), political nastiness that is nothing new but certainly feels tiring, and many of our citizens are taking their anger over the World Trade Center attacks out on those who practice the Muslim religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having been born with a decidedly unsophisticated palate, I&#8217;ve never been interested in attending tastings. I enjoy food and various adult beverages, but never with an understanding of the sublime, gossamer subtleties of flavor that my foodie friends discuss with airy erudition. So when I was offered to attend a whiskey tasting hosted by the Friends of Saint Patrick at their Celtic Room at O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s Irish Pub, I looked at it as a chance, if nothing else, to learn that I don&#8217;t like expensive whiskeys. Sadly, this was not the case.</p>

<p>There are innumerable Irish songs about whiskey, so as a musician in a Celtic rock band, I felt that it was my professional duty to attend the tasting. &#8220;Call it R&amp;D, man, and write it off,&#8221; said a shrewd fellow attendee. </p>

<p>Tom Turner is a big man. He is also a Master of Whiskey, one of the world&#8217;s elite keepers of an ancient tradition, so his size is advantageous considering the fact that he basically drinks whiskey for a living. And if that sounds like a tough gig, consider that he flies all over the world to do it, the poor guy. Gregarious and animated, Turner clearly loves his chosen career path and possesses a vast amount of knowledge about the history and the making of countless varieties of scotch, whiskey, and bourbon. I had no idea that there was so much to know about a Jack and Coke.</p>

<p>Actually, there was no Jack Daniels, and any whiskey-drinker would shriek in unholy terror at the thought of adding anything other than a few drops of water to the fine whiskeys tasted that night. Rare varieties of Crown Royal and Bushmill&#8217;s, fine single malts and esoteric Irish whiskeys were passed around and discussed, along with some interesting anecdotes about the storied history of distilling. I was particularly interested in what the supposed &#8220;Jameson is Catholic, Bushmill&#8217;s is Protestant&#8221; rift was. In fact, the rift was fabricated by the very company that made both brands, Irish Distilleries. The whole thing isn&#8217;t some sort of religious conflict, it&#8217;s a marketing tactic.</p>

<p>I enjoyed each and every one of the six varieties we tasted that night, even the one that tasted like smoked dirt (I was to learn that the particular whiskey was &#8220;double peated&#8221;). I was surprised at how dignified the event was, as the last time I was in a room full of whiskey-drinkers, there was a mechanical bull and sawdust on the floor. And I remember leaving the Celtic Room. </p>

<p>As the night drew to a close, attendees were gratefully gulping down the food that was provided. I felt enlightened, knowing how to truly appreciate a fine whiskey. I&#8217;ve not forsaken the stalwart Jack and Coke, but I do have a deeper respect for the ancient and noble spirit Whiskey and appreciation of its liquid gold color. I asked Tom Turner how one gets a job as a Master of Whiskey, and more importantly, how one keeps it when a love for the stuff is required. He laughed, but didn&#8217;t answer.</p>

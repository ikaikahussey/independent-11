<p>HONOLULU&#8212;This morning, President Barack Obama signed <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-1055" title="S. 1055">S. 1055</a>, an act to grant the Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and the Military Intelligence Service in recognition of their dedicated service during World War II.</p>

<p>The Congressional Gold Medal recognizes &#8220;Nisei soldiers&#8221;&#8212;Japanese-Americans born of immigrant parents&#8212;who fought in Europe and the Asia-Pacific theatre at a time when the U.S. government sent their families to internment camps throughout the country. Six Japanese-American World War II veterans attended today’s signing ceremony, including:</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, Member of 442nd Regiment<br />
Osamu “Sam” Fujikawa, President, 100th Infantry Battalion Veterans<br />
Grant H. Ichikawa, Veteran of WWII and Korean War<br />
Jimmie Kanaya, Veteran of WWII<br />
Terry Shima, Member of 442nd Regiment and Executive Director, Japanese American Veterans Association<br />
Yeiichi “Kelly” Kuwayama, Member of 442nd Regiment</p>

<p>The 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team became the most decorated units in United States military history for its size and length of service. Combined, the 100th Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team received 7 Presidential Unit Citations, 21 Medals of Honor, 29 Distinguished Service Crosses, 560 Silver Stars, 4,000 Bronze Stars, 22 Legion of Merit Medals, 15 Soldier’s Medal, and over 4,000 Purple Hearts. </p>

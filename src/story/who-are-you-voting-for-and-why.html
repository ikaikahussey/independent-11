<p>Yes, it&#8217;s General Election day 2010. The day when Republicans are supposed to make the mid-term counter-punch and take back seats in Congress, move into governors&#8217; mansions across the country, and possibly have a caucus in Hawaii&#8217;s ledge larger than you can count on two hands. It&#8217;s been a terrific effort by the Hawaii Republican party to get candidates in every district and communicate their ideas this campaign season.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also the day when Democrats hope to remind people that the Obama-led time of change is not over yet. After eight long years under Gov. Linda Lingle, the Dems are counting on moving back up to the fifth floor of the State Capitol.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s up to Hawaii&#8217;s voters to decide what happens next.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, you&#8217;ll probably hear a familiar question: &#8220;You voted yet? Who you voted for?&#8221;</p>

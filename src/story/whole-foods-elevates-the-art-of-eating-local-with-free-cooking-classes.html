<p>KAHALA&#8212;Whole Foods Kahala, now a staple of the Honolulu foodie scene, is a nibbler&#8217;s paradise with scrumptious samples seductively scattered throughout the welcoming space. But my sampling habit reached new and possibly even virtuous heights when I attended their recent presentation on &#8220;Cooking with Local Flavor.&#8221; Part of a series of free classes offered right inside the Kahala store, the premise for this particular event on April 29 was to cook a delicious and healthy meal using strictly locally sourced ingredients.</p>

<p>When I arrived, there was a sizable crowd gathered around Chef Kathi Alice Saks. On the menu was Baby Arugula Salad with Maui Strawberries, Big Island Macadamia Nuts, Surfing Goat Cheese, and Christmas Berry Honey Vinaigrette Topped with Local Herb Seared Opah. </p>

<p>Chef Kathi delivered an animated and informative cooking demonstration, the kind of enticing presentation that has made programs on the Food Network so popular with home cooks, foodies, and late-night channel surfers. Besides learning how to cook the aforementioned dish, I picked up a couple of other useful tips along the way, such as how to avoid fish sticking to the grill (oil it first, and allow it to cook undisturbed long enough for it to develop a crust) and how to improve homemade salad dressings (err on the pungent side because the flavors mellow out when combined with other flavors within the salad). </p>

<p>The entire cooking demo took under a half hour and included a tasting of the final product and a printed copy of the recipe (of which an abridged version appears below). Natalie Aczon, head of marketing, was on hand as well, offering other tips about shopping economically yet locally within Whole Foods.</p>

<p>Many of the participants had pre-registered, but Whole Foods shoppers passing by were also welcome to observe and partake in the tasting (though they were not guaranteed a seat). Vickie from Kahala admitted that she had been wanting to attend a Whole Foods class for a long time, but that the times had always conflicted with her work schedule. So, when she saw this class on offer at 6:00 p.m., she immediately signed up. Two women who were shopping together and happened to come upon the demo stopped to observe because they noticed strawberries were included in the featured dish. The women said that they had just discovered &#8220;how much better local strawberries were&#8221; compared to their mainland counterparts.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A friend that accompanied me to the class brought along her elementary-school-age children. Later that weekend, her son apparently chided his father allowing his fish to stick to the grill and taught him how to avoid that problem in the future. Clearly he had been paying attention!&nbsp; </p>

<p>Chef Kathi, who also offers in-home private chef services, commented that Whole Foods has made an effort to lower their prices during this weak economy and that she values their &#8220;commitment to the community.&#8221;&nbsp; Certainly, free classes such as these reflect this commitment while simultaneously showcasing local ingredients. I, for one, thought the dish was so tasty and easy to make that I went home and cooked up a modified version that very evening&#8212;delish!</p>

<p><i>The next Cooking with Local Flavor event will be Thursday, May 27, at 6:00 p.m. Sign up at the Customer Service Desk inside Whole Foods Kahala.

<b>Baby Arugula Salad with Maui Strawberries, Big Island Macadamia Nuts, Surfing Goat Cheese, and Christmas Berry Honey Vinaigrette Topped with Local Herb Seared Opah</b></p>

<p>For four dinner portions:</p>

<p>3/4 cup Hawaiian Mac Nuts<br />
1/4 cup Mac nut oil (preferably vanilla infused)<br />
2 - 3 TBSP local Christmas Berry Honey<br />
3/4 TBSP juice from local grapefruit (or Govinda&#8217;s brand)<br />
1 TSP local lime juice<br />
As needed - Hawaiian sea salt<br />
3/4 cup Maui strawberries, trimmed and sliced<br />
1/3 cup Surfing Goat Cheese, room temp.<br />
As needed - fresh, local herbs such as tarragon, rosemary, oregano or basil<br />
5 cups local baby arugula<br />
1 1/4 lbs opah (ask to have skin removed)<br />
Optional: Strawberry Lavender Pepper Jelly</p>

<p><br />
1. Process mac nuts in a food processor just enough to break them up, avoiding pulverizing them into dust. Or, a good hand-chop will work too.<br />
2. Whisk together 1/4 cup mac nut oil, the honey, grapefruit juice, lime juice, and a pinch of salt. Taste and adjust flavors to achieve desired punch, keeping in mind that it will mellow when mixed with other ingredients.<br />
3. Finely chop the herbs and set aside.<br />
4. Remove skin from fish if necessary and cut into four equal portions. Sprinkle both sides with salt and herb mix.<br />
5. Heat remaining mac nut oil in frying pan until bubbles form. Add fish and refrain from touching it again for two or three minutes so that it can develop a good sear.&nbsp; Once this happens, it will be easy to flip and won&#8217;t stick. Once flipped, cook another three minutes, then lower heat to low and put a lid on the pan.&nbsp; Wait until the fish is almost cooked through and then remove to rest (it will continue to cook off heat). Top with jelly if using.&nbsp; <br />
6. In a large bowl mix arugula, strawberries, mac nuts, crumbled goat cheese and dressing. Top with fish and enjoy!</p>

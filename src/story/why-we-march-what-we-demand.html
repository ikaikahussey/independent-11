<p><strong>WHY WE MARCH</strong></p>

<p>We march to redress old grievances and to help resolve an American crisis.</p>

<p>That crisis is born of the twin evils of racism and economic deprivation. They rob <em>all</em> people, Negro and white, of dignity, self-respect, and freedom. They impose a special burden on the Negro, who is denied the right to vote, economically exploited, refused access to public accommodations, subjected to inferior education, and relegated to substandard ghetto housing.</p>

<p>Discrimination in education and apprenticeship training renders Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and other minorities helpless in our mechanized, industrial society. Lacking specialized training, they are the first victims of automation. Thus the rate of Negro unemployment is nearly three times that of whites.</p>

<p>Their livelihoods destroyed, the Negro unemployed are thrown into the streets, driven to despair, to hatred, to crime, to violence. All America is robbed of their potential contribution.</p>

<p>￼Despite this crisis, reactionary Republicans and Southern Democrats in Congress are still working to defeat effective civil rights legislation. They fight against the rights of all workers and minority groups. They are sworn enemies of freedom and justice. They proclaim states rights in order to destroy human rights.</p>

<p>The Southern Democrats come to power by disfranchising the Negro. They know that as long as block workers are voteless, exploited, and underpaid, the fight of the white workers for decent wages and working conditions will fail. They know that semi-slavery for one means semi-slavery for all.</p>

<p>We march to demonstrate, massively and dramatically, our unalterable opposition to these forces-and to their century-long robbery of the American people. Our bodies, numbering over 100,000, will bear witness - will serve historic notice - that Jobs and Freedom are needed NOW.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WE DEMAND</strong></p>

<p>1. Comprehensive and effective <em>civil rights legislation</em> from the present Congress – without compromise or filibuster – to guarantee all Americans access to all public accommodations decent housing adequate and integrated education the right to vote</p>

<p>2. Withholding of Federal funds from all programs in which discrimination exists.</p>

<p>3. <em>Desegregation of all school districts in 1963.</em></p>

<p>4. Enforcement of the <em>Fourteenth Amendment</em> – reducing Congressional representation of states where citizens are disfranchised.</p>

<p>5. A new Executive Order banning discrimination in all housing supported by federal funds.</p>

<p>6. Authority for the Attorney General to institute <em>injunctive suits</em> when any constiutional right is violated.</p>

<p>7. A massive federal program to train and place all unemployed workers – Negro and white – on meaningful and dignified jobs at decent wages.</p>

<p>8. A national <em>minimum wage</em> act that will give all Americans a decent standard of living. (Government surveys show that anything less than $2.00 an hour faila to do this.)</p>

<p>9. A broadened <em>Fair Labor Standards Act</em> to include all areas of employment which are presently excluded.</p>

<p>10. A federal <em>Fair Employment Practices Act</em> barring discrimination by federal, state and municipal governments, and by employers, contractors, employment agencies, ond trade unions.</p>

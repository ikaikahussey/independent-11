<p>HONOLULU&#8212;Against a backdrop of a down economy and with many Lingle-era hot button issues still burning, it seems timely, even mandatory, to ask the question: What is the value of Hawaii?</p>

<p>Inspired, enraged, and spurred to action by the recently released book <i><a href="http://thevalueofhawaii.com/" title="The Value of Hawaii">The Value of Hawaii</a></i>, edited by Craig Howes and Jonathan Kay Kamakawiwoole Osorio, comes &#8220;We Value Hawaii,&#8221; an all-day event on Saturday, September 25 at Fresh Café. Citizens of all ages and politicians alike are asked to come together in a public forum activated by artwork, collaborative projects, live performances, and hands-on workshops, which address big issues affecting Hawaii&#8212;public education, the future of the arts, tourism, and the environment.</p>

<p>The event is led by Creative Modern Activism (CMA), a group of Hawaii-based artists and scholars formed in 2009 to support peace and social justice through the arts.</p>

<p>As a result of the poor economy, Hawaii is experiencing a mass migration of creative people, especially younger artists and musicians, who are leaving Hawaii for better opportunities elsewhere, CMA members explain.</p>

<p>To specifically address this issue, a panel discussion titled &#8220;Creating Hawaii: The Future for Arts and Artists&#8221; will be held from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Scholars, activists, and politicians will be on hand to talk about the future of creative arts in Hawaii, with a focus on the problems many young artists face today. With less support and less money for the arts, whether it be in public elementary school classrooms or as grants for veteran cultural groups, panelists will try to find ways to fill that void. The discussion will also explore what we value about the arts in Hawaii, and what we are willing to do to protect what we value?</p>

<p>Other &#8220;We Value Hawaii&#8221; features include hands-on workshops and interactive projects set in designated &#8220;activity zones&#8221; from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Technologist, cultural critic, and educator David Goldberg will lead &#8220;Exquisite Values,&#8221; a collaborative video essay project in which participants are invited to respond to essay topics from <i>The Value of Hawaii</i> like Hawaiian sustainability, tourism, the military, race, and ethnicity. Vince Ricafort, a local artist and cycling advocate, will also be on hand to present his &#8220;Everyday Biking&#8221; rack and offer tips and tricks on how to make Hawaii a more bike-friendly place. A make-a-button station will be headed up by local indie music scene leader Josh Hancock of Black Square. A &#8220;We Value Printed Matter&#8221; station will be piloted by <i>FLUX Magazine</i> editor and publisher Lisa Yamada and will feature a DIY book-making activity.</p>

<p>One of the goals of the &#8220;We Value Hawaii&#8221; event is to connect with the next generation of community leaders, social justice advocates, and cultural producers. To reach this goal, CMA has organized a free, all-ages music and spoken word showcase from 3:00 p.m to 1:00 a.m. featuring local performers Narwhal, Stephen Agustin, Jon Osorio, Big Mox, Deep Throat, and Youth Speaks Hawaii. In addition, local music scene heavyweights The Jump Offs and Black Square will wrap things up from 8:00 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.</p>

<p>Internationally acclaimed dance and theater company Monkey Waterfall, based out of Honolulu, will also perform an excerpt from <i>A Shrine to Paradise</i>, originally presented in 2007 at Honolulu Hale. <i>A Shrine to Paradise</i> explores the topic of tourism and its effects on the local community. Resonating with content in Ramsay Remigius Mahealani Taum’s essay on tourism and John P. Rosa’s essay on race and ethnicity in <i>The Value of Hawaii</i>, Monkey Waterfall&#8217;s performance poses critical questions about Hawaii’s identity and value by asking, “Who are we really and what is hidden behind our most popular icons: hula dancers, Japanese wedding sites, missionaries, tour guides, Waikiki?” </p>

<p>&#8220;We Value Art&#8221; is a visual representation of key concepts addressed in <i>The Value of Hawaii</i> created on a unique 11”x17” poster by six local visual artists. Event organizers will give away 200 copies of each art poster to those who answer questions related to the book project, such as “What does tourism mean to you?” or “What do you value about Hawaii?” Invited poster artists inlcude Kate Burlingame, Matthew K. Ing, Joel Gaspar, Ihi Lani, Dana Paresa, Kaycee Phillips, and Bronson Kyu Shimabukuro.</p>

<p>The upstairs loft area of Fresh Café will feature site-specific art installations designed to question and examine themes highlighted in <i>The Value of Hawaii</i>. Installation artists include: db amorin, Ryan Greenly, Vincent Ricafort, Misa Tupou, and collaborative duo Griffith + Lagaso Goldberg, whose project utilizes software developed by media artists David A.M. Goldberg and Julio Cesar Morales.</p>

<p>CMA is also presenting the &#8220;If Not Now When Award for Visual Arts&#8221; and the &#8220;If Not Now When Award for Music.&#8221; Available to Hawaii-based artists and musicians, these awards recognize their achievements, encourage the production of new work, and help sustain the creative process. There is a $500 grant award per genre. Awardees will be invited to participate in a future exhibitions sponsored by CMA. The awards will be announced at 8:00 p.m.</p>

<p><i>The event is free and open to all ages until 8:00 p.m. After 8:00 p.m. the event has a $5 cover charge and welcomes those 18 and over. Alcohol will be available from 6:00 p.m onward. Food will be available for purchase from the Fresh Café kitchen, which is open until 2:00 a.m.</i></p>

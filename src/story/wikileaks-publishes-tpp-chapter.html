<p>A key chapter of the secret Pacific-wide trade deal has been published today by <a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp/pressrelease.html">WIkileaks</a>.</p>

<p>The TPP negotiations are currently at a critical stage. The Obama administration is preparing to <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/754099a2-457f-11e3-b98b-00144feabdc0.html">fast-track the TPP treaty</a> in a manner that will prevent the US Congress from discussing or amending any parts of the treaty. Numerous TPP heads of state and senior government figures, including President Obama, have declared their intention to sign and ratify the TPP before the end of 2013.</p>

<p>Current TPP negotiation member states are the United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei.</p>

<p>The 95-page, 30,000-word IP Chapter disclosed by Wikileaks today lays out provisions for instituting a far-reaching, transnational legal and enforcement regime, modifying or replacing existing laws in TPP member states. The Chapterâ€™s subsections include agreements relating to patents (who may produce goods or drugs), copyright (who may transmit information), trademarks (who may describe information or goods as authentic) and industrial design.</p>

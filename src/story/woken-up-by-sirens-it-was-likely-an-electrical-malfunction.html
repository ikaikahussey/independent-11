The project outfitted eight Oahu sirens with modems that allow for remote satellite activation.   The contractor involved with the project inadvertently activated sirens at Diamond Head, Kamiloiki, Makiki, McCully, Moanalua Valley, and Waimanalo.  Protocols are being developed to prevent a recurrence.   “We apologize for any anxiety this early morning sounding caused for area residents,” said Doug Mayne, Vice Director of Civil Defense.  </blockquote>",

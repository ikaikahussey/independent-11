<p>The package of bills cover five areas of concern to women of all ages and economic background, including improving reporting and enforcement of <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/collections/domestic-violence">domestic violence</a> and sexual assaults, reducing violence and sexual assaults on college campuses, ensuring women’s access to healthcare, addressing Hawaii’s high cost of living faced by working families, and restoring public trust of <a href="http://hawaiiindependent.net/story/tackling-domestic-violence-hawaii-must-do-better">Hawaii’s law enforcement community</a>.<br />
 <br />
“Domestic violence, campus assaults, perceived unsympathetic law enforcement officials—all of these issues remain ongoing concerns for women of all ages from all backgrounds,” said Representative Della Au Belatti (Makiki, Tantalus, Papakolea, McCully, Pawaa, Manoa). “Whenever we think we are making progress, reports like the recent Star-Advertiser article on the U.S. Department of Education’s investigation of 55 college campuses across the nation punctures that balloon.<br />
 <br />
“It shows we need to continue to press our case for better reporting and enforcement of domestic violence and sexual assault on our schools campuses, for greater transparency and accountability from our law enforcement entities, for better access to health care for women, and for greater support for women who are often more vulnerable to the high cost of living in Hawaii,” she continued.<br />
 <br />
“In the package we also highlight our concern for women’s health,” said Senator Rosalyn Baker (South and West Maui). “Breast and cervical cancer still goes undetected for too many women in Hawaii. One of our bills will provide funding to expand screening and treatment services to under-served, at-risk women.&nbsp; These cancers can be successfully treated and cured, if found early. This bill’s modest investment will save suffering, healthcare costs and lives.”<br />
 <br />
“Our state has the highest cost of living in the nation and we are in dire need of affordable housing,” added Senator Suzanne Chun Oakland (Liliha, Palama, Iwilei, Kalihi, Nuuanu, Pacific Heights, Pauoa, Lower Tantalus, Downtown). “A 2011 housing study informed the state that we will be 50,000 housing units short by 2016. This creates a perfect storm for many low-income earners, many of whom are women supporting their families, who are trying to get by paycheck to paycheck and keep a roof over their heads. Amending the income tax credit for low-income renters is one strategic component that will put more money in their pockets to support their families.”</p>

<p>The Women&#8217;s Legislative Caucus is made up of all the female members of the state House and Senate.&nbsp; Each year the caucus presents a package of bills relevant to the well-being of women and families and supports the bills throughout the legislative session. Reps. Belatti and and Cynthia Thielen, and Sens. Baker and Chun Oakland serve as co-chairs of the Caucus.</p>

<p>HONOLULU&#8212;The City and County of Honolulu today announced that the World Invitational Hula Festival, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary, will take place at the Neal Blaisdell Concert Hall on November 10 through 12.</p>

<p>The City Department of Enterprise Services worked with event organizers to change the venue due to the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference limiting parking near the Waikiki Shell, where the festival has been held for more than a decade.</p>

<p>The World Invitational Hula Festival organizers agreed to move to the Concert Hall where parking is available. The Concert Hall’s outdoor lawn will also be utilized to display Hawaiian made and native crafts, which will be sold during the festival. </p>

<p>The Royal Hawaiian Band will perform on the festival’s opening day to highlight its 20 years of celebrating Hawaiian culture through dance.</p>

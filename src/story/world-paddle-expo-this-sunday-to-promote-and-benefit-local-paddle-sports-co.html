<p>MOILIILI&#8212;The inaugural World Paddle Expo on October 3 will feature the best local, national, and international water athletes and showcase vendors from a large variety of paddle sports. Proceeds will benefit the Hawaii Canoe and Kayak Team (HCKT), who just brought in accomplished Australian paddler Shelley Oates-Wilding as the new head coach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our goal is to provide an opportunity for local athletes to compete against the best in the world and bring together the all paddling communities locally and abroad,&#8221; said Oates-Wilding, who is also the event&#8217;s organizer. &#8220;We also want to prepare our youth to dream of one day representing Hawaii on the world and Olympic stage.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Held at the Ala Wai Community Park, the World Paddle Expo will serve as an exhibition for six different areas of paddling, ranging from Olympic caliber K1 kayaking to one-person outriggers canoes, rudderless canoes, SUP, surf ski, and paddle boarding.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Formatted much like existing world class events such as the IVF World Sprints for Outrigger and the ICF flatwater Olympic competition for kayaking, competitors will race in 200m heats throughout the day in pursuit of $6,000 of prize money.</p>

<p>This event, open to the public, will feature a youth, open, and elite division for various levels of experience and hopes to attract all who have an interest in water sports and traditional Hawaiian paddling. Unlike other single craft sprint events, the World Paddle Expo will provide water crafts to keep it fair and also award the best all-around water man who is able to achieve the best results in all six disciplines. </p>

<p>Entrants can choose to enter one or all of the six of the paddling sports but are encouraged to participate in as many as possible; the entrance fee is for the day and the scoring system rewards the well-rounded paddler. The idea is to bring the paddling community together.</p>

<p>This first-ever event has already attracted the interest of paddlers from across the world, with paddlers committed from Italy, Hungary, and Australia. Ensuring strong international competition, the Expo will be held between the weeks of what&#8217;s known as the World Championships of Outrigger paddling, the Na Wahine O Ke Kai for women and the Molokai Hoe for men. </p>

<p>HCKT, the event&#8217;s beneficiary, was founded in 1988 through a United States Olympic Committee grant with Billy Whitford hired to recruit and train young paddlers. HCKT has competed in every National Championship and many regional competitions since its founding and its athletes have competed internationally at the highest level of competition. It shares a canoe halau on the Ala Wai Canal near the Hawaii Convention Center and its qualified coaches provide direct supervision of athletes during year-round early morning and afternoon practice sessions. The HCKT training program follows recommendations from the National Team coaching staff.</p>

<p>Last month, HCKT sent 18 athletes to the National Kayaking Championships in Oklahoma City. HCKT is also now home to the National Men&#8217;s Kayaking Team, training here for the London 2012 Olympics, with two of our local national team members Patrick and Ryan Dolan, who will undoubtedly be the ones to watch in the elite category.</p>

<p>Those who aren&#8217;t as water savvy as the Dolans, or even those who don’t want to race at all, can still enjoy the Expo. Spectators can experience outrigger canoeing through clinics and exhibitions, as well as browse the various local businesses. Assorted vendors will be set up to talk story with members of the paddling community and provide valuable resources for those interested in the sport.<br />
 <br />
Local sponsors have also stepped up to make the event world class. Outrigger Hotels and Resorts are offering great deals for both spectators and competitors during the Expo, and Umeke Market will provide their delicious local food for competitors. The awards presentation will be held at the venue followed by event party at Murphy&#8217;s Bar and Grill following the event.</p>

<p>&#8220;This event is a major fund raiser to enable us to take our Hawaiian paddling culture to the world and bring the world to Hawaii, so please come and enjoy all the wonderful benefits of our sport, our culture and our people,” Oates-Wilding said.</p>

<p>All entrants must pre-register, either online at <a href="http://www.worldpaddleexpo.com" title="www.worldpaddleexpo.com">www.worldpaddleexpo.com</a> or at the venue itself between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. on Saturday.

<p>On Tuesday, December 3, 2013, public advocacy groups across the globe took to the streets to protest the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).&nbsp; The Hawaii protest was held at the Prince Kuhio Federal Building in Honolulu.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The new pending international treaty has been negotiated by the US Trade Representative (USTR) and 11 other Trans-Pacific nations over the past three years, with the help of 600 &#8220;corporate advisers.&#8221;&nbsp; Although the new treaty is being called a free trade agreement, only 5 of the 29 chapters reportedly deal with trade.&nbsp; Leaked information reveals that the pending treaty provides sweeping new rules regarding privacy, environmental laws, patents, intellectual property rights, health and safety.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The USTR stated goal is to &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; the treaty through Congress using a little known Trade Promotion Authority, allowing only an up or down vote, with no chance for amendment to the sweeping new treaty.&nbsp; The corporate advisers who have been helping to negotiate the treaty behind closed doors include Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, Halliburton, Monsanto, Dow Chemical, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Wal-Mart, etc,etc.</p>

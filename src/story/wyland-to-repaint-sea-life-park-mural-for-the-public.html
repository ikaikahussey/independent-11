<p>WAIMANALO&#8212;Environmental artist Wyland and musician Henry Kapono will be on hand to celebrate Wyland’s 55th birthday and to support the official launch of the <a href="http://www.eeinhawaii.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Hawaii Environmental Education Alliance</a> (HEEA) and the culmination of Hawaii FOCUS at Sea Life Park on Saturday, July 9 from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>FOCUS is a partnership launched in 2009 between the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/" target="_blank">US Forest Service</a>, <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA), and the <a href="http://www.wylandfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Wyland Foundation</a> with the mission to inspire water conservation and natural resource appreciation from the forest to the sea. </p>

<p>This year, national coordinators decided to host the program in Hawaii with support of local sponsor and coordinator, the DLNR-Division of Forestry and Wildlife.</p>

<p>The day’s festivities will include Wyland’s public re-painting of his mural adorning Sea Life Park’s main walkway in the Park. Keiki are invited to help Wyland paint six 16’ x 5’ murals at 11:15 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Wyland will also be available for autographs at 1:00 p.m. Dolphin shows will be held throughout the day. Henry Kapono will perform at Sea Life Park Meadow at 11:15 a.m. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s the mission of FOCUS to empower young people to become clean water ambassadors working within their communities to foster long-term natural resource conservation efforts. Through FOCUS’s concepts of study, exploration, and celebration, students and community can gain a comprehensive understanding of water management, climate, and the importance of sustainable ecosystems in everyday lives. Students across the state of Hawaii have painted 16 murals representing their connections to Hawaii’s unique natural and cultural resources.</p>

<p>HEEA supports all environmental education organizations by leveraging resources through a searchable database to provide information about grants, educational resources, professional development opportunities, and more. The database, found at <a href="http://www.heea.org" target="_blank">www.heea.org, is an active network developed by and for Hawaii’s partners in education and the community.&nbsp;  </p>

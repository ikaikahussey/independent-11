<p>I woke up extremely annoyed to the sound of the tsunami alarm at 6 a.m. this morning. Amazingly, my baby slept through. I assumed it was an accidental alarm, when I realized it wasn&#8217;t the first and went back to sleep. When I finally got up after an hour of my phones ringing, I saw that my fireman brother in law had called and thought it may be worth a call back. An 8.8 magnitude  earthquake in Chile, you probably know the story. It supposedly hit in the same place that caused the tsunami that hit Hilo in the 60s, and I grew up there and saw photos of it my whole life. I have been hearing a larger than normal amount of traffic heading up Pupukea hill, where we will go too. A friend said the North Shore is alread crowded with a mass exodus of traffic. I bet there&#8217;s a long line outside of Starbucks. Will keep you posted.</p>

<p>Michele McLellan provides rough categories for new journalism business models in a <a href="http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/leadership_blog/comments/towards_order_in_the_amazing_chaos_that_is_news/">recent piece</a> for the Knight Digital Media Center. I&#8217;d say that we&#8217;re  working in the space between #2 (&#8220;The local news entrepreneurs&#8221;) and #3 (&#8220;The community lovers&#8221;). Our strength is certainly our grounding in local communities. And we certainly do need caffeine, which is why I&#8217;m thankful for the constellation of coffee shops around our downtown office ? Downtown Coffee, BadAss, the Mix, Satura, et al. We couldn&#8217;t do it without all of you:)</p>

<p>A unique aspect of our work here at the Independent is our community-supported business model. Our <a href="/join">HI Value</a> program of discounts and deals gives a reason for readers to subscribe, above and beyond supporting local journalism. I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;s a model that can be applied to other hyperlocal news sites.</p>

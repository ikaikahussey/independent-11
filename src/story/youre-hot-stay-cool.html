<p><b>It&#8217;s hot. You&#8217;re hot. Stay cool. Here&#8217;s ten not-so-original ways to chill out in Hawaii:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>1. Head to an air conditioned mall, like Pearl Ridge, Windward Mall, or Kahala Mall enjoy the free A/C.</li>
<li>2. Go back “old school” before we had the water park and make one in your yard. Bust out the tarp, some shampoo, and some water. Put them all together and you’ve got yourself a Slip n’ slide party.</li>
<li>3. Since you’ve got to water the grass, might as well have a Sprinkler party at the same time.</li>
<li>4. Find a nice trail to hike, make sure it leads to a waterfall. Once you’ve reached the end you should be sweaty from that hot muggy walk through the tropical rainforest. You’ve finally earned it, now slip in and enjoy the refreshingly cold mountain water.</li>
<li>5. If it takes too long or it gets too hot to get to the waterfall, swim in the river.</li>
<li>6. If you’re feeling a little daring, find a nice &#8220;jump rock&#8221; or &#8220;log&#8221; like the Waimea Rock and make a big splash into the Pacific.</li>
<li>7. Getting too much sun? For a few bucks, skate at Ice Palace. Get a workout while staying cool and out of the harmful rays of the Hawaiian sun.</li>
<li>8. Just got paid? Catch a movie in the theatres – hopefully the air conditioning is working.</li>
<li>9. Go sailing, on a sailing canoe and enjoy the cool ocean breeze. Relax and let mother nature do the work.</li>
<li>10. Eat some shaved ice at Waiola Shaved Ice in Kapahulu (525 Kapahulu Ave.) and Moiliili (2135 Waiola St.).</li>
</ol>

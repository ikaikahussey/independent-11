<p>Hawaii has a rich history of strong female leaders. So it&#8217;s worth noting that Zimbabwe is introducing a new constitution which would mandate that the parliament and government be at least 1/2 female.</p>

<p>The constitution is still in draft form, so it&#8217;s too soon to cheer. And in case you&#8217;re wondering, women comprise 1/3 of Hawaii&#8217;s legislature.</p>

<p>CHINATOWN&#8212;Beware of zombies in Chinatown on Friday, October 14! Hordes of the undead will take to the streets for Hawaii’s first-ever Zombie Pub Crawl. A dozen Chinatown bars are involved, with several offering drink specials to zomb-ified participants. </p>

<p>Beginning at BAMBU TWO, the event will feature a performance by Hawaii ska royals <a href="http://gojimmygo.com/" target="_blank">Go Jimmy Go</a> at The Venue.</p>

<p>“Zombie walks” have become something of a sensation on the mainland and around the world, dozens of U.S. cities now holding events, as well as cities in Ireland, England, and Australia. The unofficial count for a zombie walk held recently near Pittsburg, Pennsylvania is 4300 zombies in attendance.</p>

<p>Such events are often held to benefit local charities, as is Friday’s in Chinatown. A portion of the proceeds from the Go Jimmy Go concert at The Venue will go to <a href="http://surferspirit.org/" target="_blank">Surfer Spirit Sessions</a>, which mentors through surfing and ocean education at-risk teens who have been adjudicated in Juvenile Court.</p>

<p>Organizers will have makeup artists on hand to zomb-ify participants for a fee, but all are encouraged to arrive in costume. Organizers also recommend two forms of ID, as participants will be costumed.</p>
